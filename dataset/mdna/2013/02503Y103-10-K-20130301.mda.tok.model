private finance portfolio for the year ended december   the million of net unrealized appreciation on our private finance portfolio investments was driven primarily by improved portfolio company performance  multiple expansion of comparable companies and narrowing investment spreads 
european capital for the year ended december   we recognized unrealized appreciation of million on our investment in european capital comprised of million unrealized appreciation on our investment and million of unrealized appreciation from foreign currency translation of the cumulative unrealized depreciation of european capital 
in determining the fair value of our investment in european capital  we concluded that our investment should be less than the nav of european capital due to comparable public traded funds which were trading at a discount to nav on the measurement date and the risks associated with our ability to realize the full fair value of european capital underlying assets for several reasons  including a public to private liquidity discount and the ability to demonstrate an implied market return on equity required by market participants for a measurable period of time  which indicate fair values at a discount to the nav 
during the year ended december   the unrealized appreciation of million  excluding unrealized appreciation depreciation on foreign currency translation  was due primarily to an increase in the nav of european capital and a reduction to the discount applied to nav 

table of contents the following is a summary composition of european capital nav at fair value and our equity investment implied discount to its nav at fair value and in millions as of december  and debt investments at fair value equity investments at fair value other assets and liabilities  net secured debt at cost unsecured debt at cost unsecured debt from american capital at cost nav euros exchange rate nav us dollars fair value of american capital equity investment implied discount to nav american capital asset management during the year ended december   we recognized million of unrealized appreciation on our investment in american capital asset management 
the unrealized appreciation in the fair value of american capital asset management for the year ended december  was primarily due to increases in the projected management fees for managing agnc due to significant growth in the equity capital of agnc as a result of follow on equity offerings and the lowering of the discount rate 
structured products investments during the year ended december   we recorded million of net unrealized appreciation on our structured products investments 
our investments in clo and cdo portfolios of commercial loans experienced million of net unrealized appreciation during the year ended december   due primarily to a narrowing of investment spreads and higher broker quotes 
our cmbs portfolio experienced million of net unrealized depreciation during the year ended december   due primarily to lower projected future cash flows due to continued credit impairments in the overall commercial real estate markets 
foreign currency translation we have investments in portfolio companies  including european capital  for which the investment is denominated in a foreign currency  primarily the euro 
we also have other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations  as reported in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we recorded net unrealized depreciation of million for foreign currency translation 
this is primarily as a result of changes in the euro and us dollar exchange rates 
for foreign currency denominated investments recorded at fair value  such as european capital  the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation from foreign currency translation on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations represents the economic impact of translating the cost basis of the investment from a foreign currency  such as the euro  to the us dollar 
however  the economic impact of translating the cumulative unrealized appreciation or depreciation from a foreign currency to the us dollar is not recorded as net unrealized depreciation or appreciation from foreign currency translation but rather is included as net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of portfolio company investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded unrealized depreciation of million for foreign currency translation on the cost basis in our investment in european capital included in our total unrealized depreciation of million for foreign currency translation for the year ended december   which was partially offset by unrealized appreciation of million for the foreign currency translation of our cumulative unrealized depreciation of our investment in european capital  which is included in our total net unrealized appreciation depreciation of portfolio investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
derivative agreements during the year ended december   we recorded million of net unrealized appreciation from derivative agreements  primarily interest rate swaps 
the fair value of the net liability for our derivative agreements as of december  was million  which included a million net reduction due to the incorporation of an adjustment for nonperformance risk of us and our counterparties 

table of contents for interest rate swap agreements  we estimate the fair value based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using a forward interest rate yield curve in effect as of the end of the measurement period  adjusted for nonperformance risk  if any  including an evaluation of our credit risk and our counterparty credit risk 
a negative fair value would represent an amount we would have to pay a third party and a positive fair value would represent an amount we would receive from a third party to assume our obligation under an interest rate swap agreement 
the derivative agreements generally appreciate or depreciate primarily based on relative market interest rates and their remaining term to maturity as well as changes in our and our counterparty credit risk 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are our revolving credit facility  cash and cash equivalents and our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had no loans outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
our term loan facility is subject to mandatory prepayments under certain conditions  set forth in the credit agreement  including at any time our borrowing base coverage is less than 
as of december   the borrowing base coverage for the term loan facility was and we were not subject to any mandatory prepayment requirements 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 
our restricted cash and cash equivalents consists primarily of collections of interest and principal payments on assets that are securitized 
in accordance with the terms of the related securitized debt agreements  based on current characteristics of the securitized loan portfolios  the restricted funds are generally used each quarter to pay interest and principal on the securitized debt and are not distributed to us or available for our general operations 
during the years ended december  and  we principally funded our operations from i cash receipts from interest  dividend and fee income from our investment portfolio and ii cash proceeds from the realization of portfolio investments through the repayments of loan investments and the sale of loan and equity investments 
as of december   our required principal amortization for the next twelve months consists of million scheduled amortization on our term loan facility and any principal amortization of our secured notes within our asset securitizations as a result of principal and interest payments on our securitized debt investments 
we believe that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow through the receipt of interest  dividend and fee payments from our investment portfolio  as well as cash proceeds from the realization of select portfolio investments  to allow us to continue to service our debt  pay our operating costs and expenses  fund capital to our current portfolio companies and originate new investments 
however  there is no certainty that we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity 
operating and investing cash flow for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operations was million and million  respectively 
our cash flows from operations for the years ended december  and was primarily from the collection of interest  dividends and fees on our investment portfolio less operating expenses 
for the years ended december  and  net cash provided by investing activities was million and million  respectively 
our cash flow from investing activities includes cash proceeds from the realization of portfolio investments totaling  million and  million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had portfolio investments totaling billion at fair value  including billion in debt investments  billion in equity investments and billion in structured products investments 
however  our investments are generally illiquid and no active primary or secondary market exists for the trading of these investments and our estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that may be ultimately realized 
we are generally repaid or exit our investments upon a change of control event of the portfolio company  such as a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
for the year ended december   approximately million of interest income collected was generated from securitized assets  which is included in our cash flow from operations on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
however  because of defaulted loan collateral within our asset securitizations  all interest collections within the securitizations are currently required to be used to pay interest and principal on the outstanding notes in our securitizations with such principal payments included in our cash flow from financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  net cash used in financing activities was million and  million  respectively 
the primary use of cash from financing activities during the year ended december  was debt payments of million on our asset securitizations and million for repurchases of our common stock 
the primary use of financing cash during the year ended december  was  million for debt payments and million for repurchases of our common stock  partially offset by a million decrease in debt service escrows

table of contents total return swap on december   american capital trs  llc actrs  a wholly owned consolidated affiliate of american capital  entered into a non recourse total return swap trs with citibank  na citibank 
the trs is non recourse to american capital 
the trs is a synthetic swap agreement that replicates the performance of a reference pool of broadly syndicated loans reference pool 
under the terms of the trs  actrs receives from citibank an amount that is essentially a proportionate amount of the margin on the interest and fees payable in respect of the loans included in the reference pool during the relevant period 
additionally  on a periodic basis  actrs pays to citibank an amount that is essentially equal to the average of the outstanding principal amount of the loans and outstanding letters of credit included in the reference pool during the relevant period  multiplied by a spread of per annum for the first months of the trs and thereafter 
in addition  upon repayment or removal of a loan from the reference pool  actrs will either receive from citibank the appreciation in the value of such loan  or pay to citibank any depreciation in the value of such loan 
on a monthly basis  a net payment between actrs and citibank for interest and realized appreciation and depreciation on the portfolio of loans occurs 
the trs is accounted for as a derivative pursuant to asc under the terms of the trs  actrs has the ability to designate loans  to be included in the reference pool 
in order for citibank to add a loan to the reference pool  each individual loan  and the portfolio of loans taken as a whole  must meet certain specified criteria 
the maximum amount of the trs facility is million determined at the time each such loan becomes subject to the trs 
after the first six months of the trs  actrs is required to pay a fee if the notional funded amount of the trs does not exceed an agreed upon minimum 
actrs is initially required to cash collateralize of the face amount of loans included in the reference pool  up to a maximum collateral of million and subject to a minimum of million at all times 
as of december   million of the cash collateral requirement had been funded 
actrs may also be required to post additional collateral from time to time as a result of a decline in the fair value of the loans included in the reference pool 
if actrs does not deposit additional cash collateral when required to do so  then citibank will have the right to terminate the trs and seize all or a portion of the cash collateral posted by actrs to cover any losses it incurs in such early termination 
american capital exposure under the trs is limited to the value of assets held at actrs  which primarily consists of cash collateral on deposit with citibank 
non performing loans analysis we stop accruing interest on our debt investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
our valuation analysis serves as a critical piece of data in this determination

table of contents impact of inflation we believe that inflation can influence the value of our investments through the impact it may have on interest rates  the capital markets  the valuations of business enterprises and the relationship of the valuations to underlying earnings 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to a company financial condition and results of operations and it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are the most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditor and the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates 
see item a 
risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 
valuation of investments our investments consist of loans and securities issued by public and privately held companies  including senior debt  mezzanine debt  equity warrants and preferred and common equity securities 
we also invest in both investment grade and non investment grade structured products 
we fair value our investments in accordance with the act and asc as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
when available  we base the fair value of our investments on directly observable market prices or on market data derived for comparable assets 
for restricted securities of companies that are publicly traded  the value is based on the closing market quote on the valuation date less a discount for the restriction 
for all other investments  inputs used to measure fair value reflect management best estimate of assumptions that would be used by market participants in pricing the investment in a hypothetical transaction 
for these investments  we estimate the fair value of our senior debt  mezzanine debt  redeemable and convertible preferred equity  common equity and equity warrants using either an enterprise value waterfall methodology or a market yield valuation methodology that generally combines market  income and cost approaches and our structured products using a market yield valuation methodology that combines market and income approaches 
asc provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for our investments existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
asc defines fair value in terms of the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the price used to measure the fair value is not adjusted for transaction costs while the cost basis of our investments may include initial transaction costs 
under asc  the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset 
the principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset 
in determining the principal market for an asset or liability under asc  it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to the market as of the measurement date 
if no market for the asset exists or if the reporting entity does not have access to the principal market  the reporting entity should use a hypothetical market 

table of contents the levels of fair value inputs used to measure our investments are characterized in accordance with the fair value hierarchy established by asc where inputs for an asset or liability fall in more than one level in the fair value hierarchy  the investment is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to that investment s fair value measurement 
we use judgment and consider factors specific to the investment in determining the significance of an input to a fair value measurement 
our policy is to recognize transfers in and out of levels as of the beginning of each reporting period 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy and investments that fall into each of the levels are described below level level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level level inputs are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data 
as of december   we use level inputs for measuring the fair value of our investments as follows the market in which we would sell our private finance investments is the mergers and acquisition m a market 
under asc  we have indentified the m a market as our principal market for portfolio companies only if we have the ability to initiate a sale of the portfolio company as of the measurement date 
we determine whether we have the ability to initiate a sale of a portfolio company based on our ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company as of the measurement date 
in evaluating if we can control or gain control of a portfolio company as of the measurement date  we include our equity securities and those securities held by entities managed by our wholly owned portfolio company  american capital asset management  on a fully diluted basis 
for investments in portfolio companies for which we do not have the ability to control or gain control as of the measurement date and for which there is no active market  our principal market under asc is a hypothetical secondary market 
accordingly  we use the m a market as our principal market for portfolio companies that we control or can gain control as of the measurement date  and we use a hypothetical secondary market for portfolio companies that we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date 
however  to the extent that an active market exists  we will consider that as our principal market 
our valuation policy considers the fact that no ready market exists for substantially all of our investments and that fair value for our investments must typically be determined using unobservable inputs 
enterprise value waterfall methodology for investments in portfolio companies that we have identified the m a market as the principal market  we estimate the fair value based on the enterprise value waterfall enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology 
for minority equity securities in which the principal market is the hypothetical secondary market  we also estimate the fair value using the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology 
under the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology  we estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company and then waterfall the enterprise value over the portfolio company securities in order of their preference relative to one another 
the enterprise value waterfall methodology assumes the loans and equity securities are sold to the same market participant in the m a market which is consistent with how market participants would transact for these items in order to maximize their value 
in applying the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology  we consider that in a change of control transaction  our loans are generally required to be repaid at par and that a buyer cannot assume the loan 
to estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company  we prepare an analysis of traditional valuation methodologies including valuations of comparable public companies  recent sales of private and public comparable companies  discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company  estimating the liquidation or collateral value the portfolio company assets  third party valuations of the portfolio company  offers from third parties to buy the company and considering the value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company 
significant inputs in these valuation methodologies to estimate enterprise value include the historical or projected operating results of the portfolio company  selection of comparable companies  discounts or premiums to the prices of comparable companies and discount rates applied to the forecasted cash flows 
the operating results of a portfolio company may be unaudited  projected or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for non recurring items or to normalize the operating results that may require significant judgment in its determination 
in evaluating the operating results  we also analyze the impact of exposure to litigation  loss of customers or other contingencies 
the selection of a population of comparable companies requires significant judgment including a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the comparability of the companies 
in determining a discount or premium  if any  to prices of comparable companies  we use significant judgment for factors such as size  marketability and relative performance 
in determining a discount rate to apply to forecasted cash flows  we use significant judgment in the development of an appropriate discount rate including the evaluation of an appropriate risk premium 

table of contents in valuing convertible debt  equity or other similar securities  we value our investment based on its priority in the waterfall and based on our pro rata share of the residual equity value available after deducting all outstanding debt from the estimated enterprise value 
we value non convertible debt at the face amount of the debt to the extent that the estimated enterprise value of the portfolio company exceeds the outstanding debt of the portfolio company 
if the estimated enterprise value is less than the outstanding debt of the portfolio company  we reduce the value of our debt investment beginning with the junior most debt such that the enterprise value less the value of the outstanding debt is zero 
market yield valuation methodology for debt and redeemable preferred equity investments in portfolio companies for which we are required to identify a hypothetical secondary market as the principal market  we determine the fair value based on the assumptions that hypothetical market participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using a market yield market yield valuation methodology based on an exchange valuation premise under asc for debt and redeemable preferred equity investments of our private finance portfolio for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date  we estimate the fair value based on such factors as third party broker quotes and our own assumptions in the absence of market observable data  including estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar loans and securities as of the measurement date 
we weight the use of third party broker quotes  if any  in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer 
we estimate the remaining life based on market data of the average life of similar loans 
however  if we have information available to us that the loan is expected to be repaid in the near term  we would use an estimated remaining life based on the expected repayment date 
the average life used to estimate the fair value of our loans may be shorter than the legal maturity of the loans since our loans have historically been prepaid prior to the maturity date 
the current interest rate spreads used to estimate the fair value of our loans is based on our experience of current interest rate spreads on similar loans 
if there is a significant deterioration of the credit quality of a loan  we may consider other factors that a hypothetical market participant would use to estimate fair value  including the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis 
we also value our investments in structured products using the market yield valuation methodology 
we estimate fair value based on such factors as third party broker quotes  sales of the same or similar securities  and our cash flow forecasts subject to assumptions a market participant would use regarding the investments underlying collateral including  but not limited to  assumptions of default and recovery rates  reinvestment spreads and prepayment rates 
cash flow forecasts are discounted using a market participant market yield assumptions that are derived from multiple sources including  but not limited to  third party broker quotes  industry research reports and transactions of securities and indices with similar structure and risk characteristics 
we weight the use of third party broker quotes  if any  in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer  depth and consistency at broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance and other market indices 
investments in alternative asset investment funds for an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value  we measure the fair value of our investment predominately based on the nav per share of the investment fund if the nav of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of fasb asc topic  financial services investment companies  as of our measurement date  including measurement of all or substantially all of the underlying investments of the investee in accordance with asc however  in determining the fair value of our investment  we may make adjustments to the nav per share in certain circumstances  based on our analysis of any restrictions on redemption of our shares of our investment as of the measurement date  comparisons of market price to nav per share of comparable publicly traded funds and trades or sales of comparable private and publicly traded funds  recent actual sales or redemptions of shares of the investment fund  public to private liquidity discounts  expected future cash flows available to equity holders including the rate of return on those cash flows compared to an implied market return on equity required by market participants  or other uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize the full nav of the investment fund 
as of december   we owned all of the equity in european capital  an investment fund that invests in senior and mezzanine debt equity of private and mid sized public companies primarily in europe 
in determining the fair value of our investment in european capital  we concluded that our equity investment should be less than the nav of european capital due to comparable publicly traded funds that were trading at a discount to nav on the measurement date and the risks associated with our ability to realize the full fair value of european capital s underlying assets for several reasons  including a public to private liquidity discount and the ability to demonstrate an implied market return on equity required by market participants for a measurable period of time  which indicate fair values at a discount to the nav 
the use of a discount to nav of european capital requires significant judgment and a change in the assumptions used to develop the discount could have a material impact on the determination 
table of contents of fair value 
further  the determination of european capital nav requires significant judgment  including the determination of the fair value of european capital s investment portfolio 
interest rate derivatives for interest rate derivative agreements  we estimate the fair value based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using a forward interest rate yield curve in effect as of the end of the measurement period  adjusted for nonperformance risk  if any  including a quantitative and or qualitative evaluation of both our credit risk and counterparty credit risk 
we consider the impact of any collateral requirements  credit enhancements or netting arrangements in evaluating credit risk 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further information regarding the classification of our investment portfolio by levels  and as of december  interest and dividend income recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
original issue discount oid and purchased discount and premiums are accreted into interest income using the effective interest method 
oid initially represents the value of detachable equity warrants obtained in conjunction with the origination of loans and loan origination fees that represent yield enhancement 
dividend income is recognized on the ex dividend date for common equity securities and on an accrual basis for preferred equity securities to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected or realized 
in determining the amount of dividend income to recognize  if any  from cash distributions on common equity securities  we will assess many factors including a portfolio company cumulative undistributed income and operating cash flow 
cash distributions from common equity securities received in excess of such undistributed amounts are recorded first as a reduction of our investment and then as a realized gain on investment 
we stop accruing interest or dividends on our investments when it is determined that the interest or dividend is not collectible 
we assess the collectability of the interest and dividends based on many factors including the portfolio company ability to service our loan based on current and projected cash flows as well as the current valuation of the portfolio company total enterprise value 
for investments with pik interest and cumulative dividends  we base income and dividend accruals on the valuation of the pik notes or securities received from the borrower or the redemption value of the security 
if the portfolio company valuation indicates a value of the pik notes or securities that is not sufficient to cover the contractual interest or dividend  we will not accrue interest or dividend income on the notes or securities and will record an allowance for any accrued interest or dividend receivable as a reduction of interest or dividend income in the period we determine it is not collectible 
a change in the portfolio company valuation assigned by us could have an effect on our accrual of pik interest income on debt investments and dividend income of preferred stock investments 
also  a change in a portfolio company operating performance and cash flows can impact a portfolio company ability to service our debt and therefore could impact our interest recognition 
interest income on structured products is recognized on the effective interest method as required by fasb asc  investments other  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets asc 
under asc  at the time of purchase  we estimate the future expected cash flows and determine the effective interest rate based on these estimated cash flows and our cost basis 
subsequent to the purchase and on a quarterly basis  these estimated cash flows are updated and a revised yield is calculated prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment 
to the extent the current quarterly estimated cash flows decrease from the prior quarterly estimated cash flows  the revised yield is calculated prospectively based on the amortized cost basis of the investment calculated in accordance with fasb asc  investment debt and equity securities 
in estimating these cash flows  there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
these include the amount and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate  and interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying loans and the timing of and magnitude of projected credit losses on the loans underlying the securities have to be estimated 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income 
as a result  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
income taxes as of december   we have a net deferred tax asset of million associated with our total ordinary deferred tax assets 
we also have million in total capital deferred tax assets of which the capital deferred tax assets are fully reserved through a valuation allowance 
assessing the recoverability of a deferred tax asset requires management to consider the company history of cumulative pretax losses in the prior three years and make estimates related to expectations of future taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from investments and operations  the character of expected income or loss as either capital or ordinary  and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction 
we are also required to make estimates related to the expected tax character of recognition of the reversal of the deferred tax assets 
to the extent that 
table of contents future cash flows or the amount or character of taxable income differ significantly from these estimates  our ability to realized the net deferred tax asset could be impacted 
stock based compensation we account for all share based awards to employees under fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility  which is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility  and the expected life of the awards which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures 
our valuation assumptions used in estimating the fair value of share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over the vesting period or the requisite service period 
in addition  we calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available within additional paid in capital in accordance with the provisions of asc the following table reflects the weighted average fair value per employee stock option granted during the years ended december   and  as well as the weighted average assumptions used in determining those fair values using the black scholes option pricing model 
options granted in millions weighted average fair value per option on grant date expected dividend yield expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years we determine our expected volatility used in the black scholes option pricing model based on a combination of our historical volatility during the expected term of the option and our implied volatility based on the market prices of traded options of our stock 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
recent accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further information regarding new accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in noi and net earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates 
because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings  our noi and net earnings are affected by the difference between the interest rate at which we invest and the interest rate at which we borrow 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our noi and net earnings 
as of december   approximately of the principal balance of the debt investments in our portfolio were at fixed rates  approximately were at variable rates with interest rate floors  primarily one month libor  were at variable rates with no interest rate floors and were on non accrual status 
additionally  approximately of our borrowings bear interest at variable rates with no interest rate floors and bear interest at variable rates with a interest rate floor 
the one month libor rate was as of december  
table of contents we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy under which we use derivative financial instruments to primarily manage the adverse impact of interest rates changes on our cash flows by locking in the spread between our asset yield and the cost of our borrowings  and to fulfill our obligation under the terms of our asset securitizations 
while our interest rate risk management strategy may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  certain derivative transactions that we may enter into in the future  such as interest rate swap agreements  may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments 
our derivatives are considered economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting under asc we record the accrual of the periodic interest settlements of interest rate derivatives in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation and subsequently record the cash payments as a realized gain or loss on the interest settlement date 
based on our december  consolidated balance sheets  the following table shows the annual impact on noi and net earnings of base rate changes in the applicable interest rate indexes  primarily one month libor  considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments and excluding changes in the fair value of our investments and derivative instruments and loans on non accrual status assuming no changes in our investment  hedging and borrowing structure in millions basis point change interest income interest expense net operating income loss net realized gain loss on derivative agreements net earnings loss up basis points up basis points up basis points up basis points down basis points represents interest rate derivative periodic interest payments 
foreign currency risks we have a limited number of investments in portfolio companies  including european capital  for which the investment is denominated in a foreign currency  primarily the euro 
we also have other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations  as reported in us dollars 
during the year ended december   the foreign currency translation adjustment recorded in our consolidated statements of operations was net unrealized depreciation of million  primarily as a result of changes in the euro and us dollar exchange rates 
as of december   our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk was estimated using a sensitivity analysis  which illustrates a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rate as of december  as stated above  the euro is the functional currency for the majority of our investments denominated in a foreign currency  and as such  the sensitivity analysis excludes any changes in other foreign currencies 
actual changes in foreign currency exchange rates may differ from this hypothetical change 
based on a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the euro to us dollar exchange rate  assuming no hedging  the fair value of our investments would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
portfolio valuation our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the act and asc due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
as of december   the fair value of all our investments were estimated using level inputs determined in good faith by our board of directors because there was no active market for such investments
