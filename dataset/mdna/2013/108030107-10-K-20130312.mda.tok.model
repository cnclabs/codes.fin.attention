critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance generally consists of specific and general reserves 
specific reserves generally relate to loans that are individually classified as impaired  but may also relate to loans that in management s opinion exhibit negative credit characteristics or trends suggesting potential future loss exposure greater than historical loss experience would suggest 
it is currently the bank s practice to immediately charge off any identified financial loss pertaining to impaired loans when management believes the uncollectibility of the loan is confirmed  therefore specific reserves are uncommon 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
loans  for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession  and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties  are generally considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired 
commercial and real estate loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
generally accepted accounting principles specify that if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as consumer and residential real estate loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment  and accordingly  they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures 
however  it is currently the bank s practice to immediately charge off any identified financial loss pertaining to impaired loans when management believes the uncollectibility of the loans has been confirmed 
substandard loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
generally accepted accounting principles specify that if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as consumer and residential real estate loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment  and accordingly  they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on substandard loans 
troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate at inception 
if a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan  the loan is reported  net  at the fair value of the collateral 
for troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default  the bank determines the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses 
see note to the financial statements for additional information on troubled debt restructurings 
general reserves cover non impaired loans and are based on historical loss rates for each portfolio segment  adjusted for the effects of qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated loan losses as of the evaluation date to differ from the portfolio segment s historical loss experience 
qualitative factors include consideration of the following changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in economic conditions  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  changes in the volume and severity of past due  nonaccrual and other adversely graded loans  changes in the loan review system  changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  concentrations of credit and the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements 
portfolio segments identified by the bank include commercial  real estate construction  land  real estate other  factoring and asset based lending  sba  and consumer loans 
relevant risk characteristics for these portfolio segments generally include debt service coverage  loan to value ratios and financial performance on non consumer loans and credit scores  debt to income  collateral type and loan to value ratios for consumer loans 
sale of sba loans the company has the ability and the intent to sell all or a portion of certain sba loans in the loan portfolio and  as such  carries the saleable portion of these loans at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value 
at december  and december   the fair value of sba loans exceeded aggregate cost and therefore  sba loans were carried at aggregate cost 
in calculating gain on the sale of sba loans  the bank performs an allocation based on the relative fair values of the sold portion and retained portions of the loan 
the company assumptions are validated by reference to external market information 
investment securities our securities are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
the fair value of most securities classified as available for sale is based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts 
supplemental employee retirement plan the company has entered into supplemental employee retirement agreements with certain executive and senior officers 
the measurement of the liability under these agreements includes estimates involving life expectancy  length of time before retirement  and expected benefit levels 
should these estimates prove materially wrong  we could incur additional or reduced expense to provide the benefits 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has sufficient taxable income from current and prior periods to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
as such  we have provided no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets

allowance for loan losses a consequence of lending activities is the potential for loss 
the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions  rising interest rates and the financial experience of the borrowers 
the allowance for loan losses  which provides for the risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process  is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and decreased by the amount of charge offs net of recoveries 
there is no precise method of estimating specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
similarly  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the level of the related provision for loan losses are determined in management s judgment based on consideration of economic conditions borrowers financial condition loan impairment evaluation of industry trends historic losses  migrations and delinquency trends industry and other concentrations loans which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management continuing evaluation of the performing loan portfolio periodic review and evaluation of problem loans off balance sheet risks assessments by regulators and other third parties in addition to the internal assessment of the loan portfolio  the company also retains a consultant who performs credit reviews on a regular basis and then provides an assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

the provision for loan losses for the twelve months ending december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan losses for the year ending december  compared to the same period one year ago reflects the growth of the loan portfolio  combined with higher charge offs and decreased recoveries experienced during the current year 
based on an evaluation of individual credits  historical credit loss experience by loan type  economic conditions  and the company s reassessment of risks  management has allocated the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans at december of the previous five years as follows as of december  dollars in thousands commercial real estate construction land loans real estate other factoring and asset based sba other commercial real estate construction land loans real estate other factoring and asset based sba other beginning in the second quarter of  deterioration in economic conditions within the company s market area and  as applicable  the state of california and or national macroeconomic conditions resulted in increased stress to the loan portfolio  specifically construction and land development loans outside of the company s primary market of santa clara county and contiguous portions of san mateo and alameda counties 
in response to the deteriorating market conditions  the company undertook steps to aggressively reduce the exposure to construction and land development loans with particular emphasis on reducting loans outside of its primary market area 
management curtailed new loan origination  thoroughly reviewed collateral values of projects approaching maturity and conservatively evaluated the market prospects of collateral for indications of impairments 
at december   the company s land development portfolio was million with just  remaining exposure outside of the primary market area 
further  approximately of the loans in this category are underwritten to amortizing term structures supported by cash flow from liquidity of the borrowers 
construction loans at december  were million with  remaining on projects outside of the primary market area 
in addition  at that date million  or  were loans to finance commercial projects 
there were no construction loans to finance residential projects of five or more units 
the aggressive management of credits in this category resulted in elevated levels of nonperforming assets as loans are placed on nonaccrual through the marketing phase of the underlying project 
in addition  loans placed on nonaccrual have been reduced to the level of indicated impairments 
this resulted in an elevated level of charge offs 
management believes that this practice results in a recorded level of nonperforming assets that generally has been reduced to a net liquidation value  and as these assets are liquidated do not expect to incur additional significant losses in  and  to a lesser extent  nonperforming loans at december   on average  have been reduced by approximately of the remaining contractual balance  which was taken as a charge off against the allowance for loan losses 
additionally  non performing loans at december   on average  have been reduced by approximately for payment received in non accrual interest 
due to positive trends in overall loan classifications during and  reflecting the improving condition of the loan portfolio combined with new loan production  the company has been able to lower the level of reserves to of total loans at december  the coverage ratio  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at december  management believes that the coverage ratio reflects the conservative charge off practice and that the allowance is adequate for losses not specifically identified in impairment analyses 
at december  nonperforming assets of million  or of total assets reflects a substantial decrease compared to million  or of total assets on december  the following summarizes nonperforming assets and loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms at december      and as of december  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis loans with principal or interest contractually past due days or more  and accruing nonperforming loans other real estate owned loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms nonperforming assets and restructured loans the nonperforming assets at december  consisted of sixteen loans on nonaccrual or days or more past due and still accruing totaling million  and other real estate owned valued at  nonperforming loans at december  were comprised of loans with legal contractual balances totaling approximately million reduced by million received in nonaccrual interest and impairment charges of million which have been charged against the allowance for loan losses 
as a result  there no longer was an indicated potential loss exposure pertaining to nonperforming loans and no impairment reserves were required to be included in the allowance for loan losses 
there were seventeen non accrual loans totaling million at december  and fifteen non accrual loans totaling million at december  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed when  in the opinion of management  there is significant doubt as to the collectability of interest or principal or when the payment of principal or interest is ninety days past due  unless the amount is well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the components of nonperforming loans as of december  dollars in thousands december  classification amount collateral real estate other special purpose facility in santa cruz county sba special purpose facility in alameda county sba special purpose facilities in san diego county sba mixed used building in santa clara county sba special purpose facilities in orange county sba lot for single family homes in contra costa county sba single family residences in orange and la counties sba commercial building in san diego county sba light industrial warehouse space in stanislaus county sba single family residence in santa clara county factoring asset based lending business assets commercial business assets land lot for commercial development in calaveras county total nonperforming loans included in nonperforming loans at december  are loans totaling million that have been modified in trouble debt restructurings  where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
these concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on a loan  payment extensions  forgiveness of principal  or other actions intended to maximize collection 
in order for these loans to return to accrual status  the borrower must demonstrate a sustained period of timely payments 
as of december   previously modified loans totaling million were considered performing due to a sustained period of timely payments and therefore were accounted for on an accrual basis 
management undertakes significant processes in order to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner 
in addition to regular interaction with the company s borrowers  the relationship managers review the credit ratings for each loan on a monthly basis and identify any potential downgrades 
for commercial and factoring asset based loans  the company receives quarterly financial statements and other pertinent reporting  such as borrowing bases for asset based facilities  so as to identify any deteriorating financial trends 
covenant compliance for these loans is also monitored on a quarterly basis 
for real estate construction and land loans  the development  construction and lease up or sell out status of each project is monitored on a monthly basis 
for sba loans and loans secured by standing commercial or residential property  the company receives updated rent rolls  operating statements  and or tax returns on an annual basis 
in addition  home equity loans are reviewed annually for deterioration in either the underlying property value or the borrower s payment history 
management also engages a third party loan review firm that reviews the loan portfolio periodically to further identify potential problem loans 
the loan review includes assessment of underwriting  quality of legal documents  management of the loan relationship  and adherence to the credit policy along with acceptable risk mitigation and rationale for exceptions to the policy 
as part of the loan approval process  management identifies the nature and type of underlying collateral supporting individual loans 
prior to or at the time of initial advances  any required lien positions are verified using ucc lien searches for personal property collateral  or title insurance for real property collateral 
the company engages a third party loan review firm to conduct an annual review of its loan documentation and the related policies and procedures regarding the loan documentation process 
the company primarily relies on fair market appraisals to determine the value of underlying real estate collateral 
appraisals are required for real property secured loans of  or more  including increases to existing loans of  or more 
in the event there is evidence of deterioration in values  an evaluation of the collateral value and or a full new appraisal is required for an extension of the loan maturity 
potential problem loans are typically reappraised every months depending size  nature  current economic conditions and the borrower s current financial performance and repayment history 
the appraisals are performed by board approved appraisers that have appropriate licensing and experience 
generally  when a prospective loan amount exceeds million  the completed appraisal is further reviewed by a qualified third party review appraiser 
to determine the value of underlying collateral for formula lines of credit that are predicated on a borrowing base of eligible assets  the company typically requires a pre loan funding field audit of the borrower s financial records to verify the accounts receivable  their eligibility for inclusion in the borrowing base  performance of the collateral and any asset concentrations 
on a monthly basis  relationship managers assess the collateral position of individual loans and identify any potential collateral shortfalls which  if left uncorrected  could result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan at some future date 
any potential collateral shortfalls are incorporated into a written corrective action plan 
the status of the corrective action plans are reviewed by executive management 
review of ability to acquire additional collateral and the related timeframes are addressed on an individual loan basis 
at the time a loan is classified as substandard which includes any loan on non accrual  the company performs an impairment analysis of the collateral based on appraisals  field audits  other market value indicators  and management s judgment 
any shortfall between the collateral s realization value and the loan balance is charged off at that time when management believes the uncollectibility of the loan is confirmed 
impairment analyses are updated on a monthly basis 
additionally  as underlying collateral is reappraised the value of the collateral is reassessed and any additional charge off is taken at that time 
a similar practice is followed for downward adjustments to the company s oreo carrying value 
management is of the opinion that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate for known and unidentified losses inherent in the portfolio 
however  although the company is seeing a lower rate of inflow into problem assets generally  as well as a consistent reduction of carrying values through continued payments by borrowers on loans that have been placed on non accrual  should circumstances change and management determines that the collectibility of any of these credits becomes unlikely  there could be an adverse effect on the level of the allowance for loan losses and the company s future profitability 
funding deposits represent the bank s principal source of funds 
most of the bank s deposits are obtained from professionals  small to medium sized businesses and individuals within the bank s market area 
the bank s deposit base consists of non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  money market and savings accounts and certificates of deposit 
the following table summarizes the composition of deposits as of december   and as of december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand money market and savings certificates of deposit less than   and more total deposit portfolio deposits increased million or from million at december  to billion at december  the increase in deposits was predominately in core deposit production which was primarily used to fund new loans and increase the investment portfolio 
leverage total gross loan balances at december  were million 
the resulting loan to deposit ratio was 
other earning assets at december  were primarily comprised of investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits of million 
to date  the company has deployed other earning assets primarily in federal funds sold to address the potential volatility of deposit balances and to accommodate projected loan funding  and in short term fixed rate investments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the company s asset sensitive balance sheet 
when deploying other earning assets  the company implements strategic decisions that may have a beneficial or adverse impact on net interest income and on the net interest margin to manage the business through a variety of economic cycles 
capital resources the company and the bank are subject to the capital guidelines and regulations governing capital adequacy for bank holding companies and national banks 
additional capital requirements may be imposed on banks based on market risk 
for discussion of capital requirements applicable to the bank and the company  see capital adequacy requirements and prompt corrective action above 
the company s capital resources consist of shareholders equity  trust preferred securities and for regulatory purposes the allowance for loan losses subject to limitations 
at december   the company s capital resources increased million to million from million at december  tier capital increased million to million at december  the company s tier capital at december  was was comprised of million of capital stock and surplus  million in retained earnings and trust preferred securities up to the allowable limit of million 
the company s tier capital at december  was million  which was comprised of million of capital stock and surplus  million in retained earnings and trust preferred securities up to the allowable limit of million 
the company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the board of governors and the occ 
the company is required to maintain total capital equal to at least of assets and commitments to extend credit  weighted by risk  of which at least must consist primarily of common equity including retained earnings tier capital and the remainder may consist of subordinated debt  cumulative preferred stock or a limited amount of allowance for loan losses 
certain assets and commitments to extend credit present less risk than others and will be assigned to lower risk weighted categories requiring less capital allocation than the total ratio 
for example  cash and government securities are assigned to a risk weighted category  most home mortgage loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring a capital allocation and commercial loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring an capital allocation 
as of december   the company s and the bank s total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively for the company and for the bank at december

financial institutions classified as undercapitalized or below are subject to various limitations including  among other matters  certain supervisory actions by bank regulatory authorities and restrictions related to i growth of assets  ii payment of interest on subordinated indebtedness  iii payment of dividends or other capital distributions  and iv payment of management fees to a parent holding company 
the fdicia requires the bank regulatory authorities to initiate corrective action regarding financial institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements 
such action may result in orders to  among other matters  augment capital and reduce total assets 
critically undercapitalized financial institutions may also be subject to appointment of a receiver or implementation of a capitalization plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity interest rate sensitivity the company strives to manage its liquidity to provide adequate funds at an acceptable cost to support the borrowing requirements and deposit flows of its customers 
liquidity requirements are evaluated by taking into consideration factors such as deposit concentrations  seasonality and maturities  loan and lease demand  capital expenditures and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 
the company s business is generated primarily through customer referrals and employee business development efforts 
the company is primarily a business and professional bank and  as such  its deposit base is more susceptible to economic fluctuations 
the company strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
at december   liquid assets as a percentage of deposits were as compared to in in addition to cash and due from banks  liquid assets include interest bearing deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  and unpledged securities available for sale 
the company has million in federal funds lines of credit available with correspondent banks to meet liquidity needs 
at december   there were no balances outstanding on these lines 
additionally  as of december   the company had a total borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank of san francisco of approximately million for which the company had collateral in place to borrow million 
as of december   million of this borrowing capacity was pledged to secure a letter of credit 
the company s balance sheet position is asset sensitive based upon the significant amount of variable rate loans and the repricing characteristics of its deposit accounts 
this balance sheet position generally provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of interest rate decreases 
net interest income is generally negatively impacted in the short term by a decline in interest rates 
conversely  an increase in interest rates should have a short term positive impact on net interest income 
management regularly reviews general economic and financial conditions  both external and internal  and determines whether the positions taken with respect to liquidity and interest rate sensitivity continue to be appropriate 
the bank utilizes a monthly gap report as well as a quarterly simulation model to identify interest rate sensitivity over the short and long term 
management considers the results of these analyses when implementing its interest rate risk management activities  including the utilization of certain interest rate hedges 
the following table sets forth the distribution of repricing opportunities  based on contractual terms  of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie interest rate gap divided by interest rate sensitive assets and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio

that is  at december  the volume of assets that might reprice within the next year exceeded the volume of liabilities that might reprice 
this position provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of rate decreases 
net interest income is negatively impacted by a decline in interest rates and positively impacted by an increase in interest rates 
to partially mitigate the adverse impact of declining rates  the majority of variable rate loans made by the bank have been written with a minimum floor rate
