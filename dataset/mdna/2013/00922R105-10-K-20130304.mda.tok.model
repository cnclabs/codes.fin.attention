item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis has been prepared with reference to the historical financial condition and results of operations of air transport services group  inc  and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors in item a of this report  our historical financial statements  and the related notes contained in this report 
background the company provides airline operations  aircraft leases  aircraft maintenance and other support services primarily to the cargo transportation and package delivery industries 
through the company subsidiaries  it offers a range of complementary services to delivery companies  freight forwarders  airlines and government customers 
the company principal subsidiaries include three independently certificated airlines  abx air  inc abx  capital cargo international airlines  inc ccia and air transport international  inc ati  and an aircraft leasing company  cargo aircraft management  inc cam 
at december   the company owned cargo aircraft in serviceable condition and leased six more under operating leases 
the owned fleet consisted of thirty six boeing aircraft  five boeing aircraft  three boeing and four mcdonnell douglas dc combi aircraft 
the combi aircraft are capable of simultaneously carrying passengers and cargo containers on the main flight deck 
the company airline subsidiaries also leased four boeing freighter aircraft and two boeing freighter aircraft from third parties as of december  in recent years we have modernized the company aircraft fleet  retiring less efficient boeing and dc aircraft and adding boeing  boeing and boeing aircraft to the fleet 
during we plan to continue adding boeing and boeing aircraft to the fleet by modifying former passenger aircraft 
as of december   the company owned two boeing aircraft that were being modified from passenger configuration into a standard freighter configuration  one boeing aircraft undergoing standard freighter modification and two boeing aircraft being prepared for service as combi aircraft 
additionally  in january  the company purchased two more boeing combi aircraft that are in the process of obtaining airworthiness certification for their combi modification 
we expect all seven of these aircraft to enter service during the company largest customer is dhl network operations usa  inc and its affiliates dhl  which accounted for of the company consolidated revenues in and of the company consolidated revenues in both and the company has had long term contracts with dhl since august commencing march   the company and dhl executed commercial agreements under which dhl leases boeing freighter aircraft from cam and contracted with abx to operate those aircraft under a separate crew  maintenance and insurance cmi agreement 
the cmi agreement pricing is based on pre defined fees  scaled for the number of aircraft operated and the number of flight crews provided to dhl for its us network 
the initial term of the cmi agreement is five years and the terms of the aircraft leases are seven years  with early termination provisions 
in addition to the cam owned boeing aircraft  abx also operates four dhl owned boeing aircraft under the cmi agreement 
we also provide two boeing aircraft to dhl under multi year contracts 
additionally  during the company airlines provided eight other boeing aircraft and one boeing aircraft to dhl under contracts and arrangements having durations of one year or less 
the us military comprised  and of the company consolidated revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company airlines contract their services to the air mobility command amc  through the us transportation command ustc both of which are organized under the us military 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues and cash flows have historically been derived from providing airlift in north america to bax global  inc  an affiliate of db schenker bax schenker 
bax schenker is a specialized heavy weight  business to business shipper 
in july  bax schenker announced its plans to adopt a new operating model that phased out the dedicated air cargo network in north america supported by the company 
in september  bax schenker ceased air cargo operations at its air hub in toledo  ohio and began to conduct air operations from the cincinnati northern kentucky airport  utilizing dhl us air hub 
instead of dedicated aircraft  bax schenker now utilizes dhl and other delivery services for its air transportation delivery requirements 
the company ceased providing services to bax schenker as of the end of the company revenues from 
table of contents the services performed for bax schenker  derived primarily by providing boeing and dc airlift  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company revenues from bax schenker comprised approximately and of the company total revenues during the years ended december  and  respectively  and of total revenues  excluding directly reimbursable revenues 
the company has two reportable segments acmi services  which primarily includes the cargo transportation operations of its three airlines and the cam segment 
the company other business operations  which primarily provide support services to the transportation industry  include aircraft maintenance  aircraft parts sales  ground equipment leasing and mail handling services 
these operations do not constitute reportable segments due to their size 
results of operations summary the consolidated net earnings from continuing operations were million and million for and  respectively 
the pre tax earnings from continuing operations were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in earnings from continuing operations in as compared to was primarily due to the recognition of asset impairment charges of million  interest rate derivative losses of million and the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance related to the refinancing of the company debt in adjusted pre tax earnings from continuing operations  a non gaap measure a definition and reconciliation of adjusted pre tax earnings is shown below  after removing impairment charges  net derivative gains or losses and charges related to debt refinancing was million for compared to million for the adjusted pre tax earnings in compared to was bolstered by increased operations for the company boeing and boeing aircraft  but were negatively impacted by the discontinuation of the bax schenker north american air network in the fourth quarter of total customer revenues from continuing operations decreased by million to million during compared to the decline reflects million of revenues during from services for the bax schenker air network which was discontinued 
revenues from reimbursed fuel and other reimbursed operating expenses declined by million during compared to these declines were also primarily due to the discontinuation of the bax schenker air network 
excluding directly reimbursed revenues  customer revenues decreased by million during compared to revenue from the deployment of additional boeing and boeing aircraft by acmi services during  was more than offset by the revenue decline from the discontinuation of the bax schenker air network

such costs include fuel expense  landing fees and certain aircraft maintenance expenses 
the types of costs that are reimbursed varies by customer operating agreement 
adjusted pre tax earnings  a non gaap measure  is pre tax earnings excluding asset impairment charges  interest rate derivative gains and losses  the write off of debt issuance costs and earnings from the termination of the severance and retention agreement s r agreement with dhl in march management uses adjusted pre tax earnings to compare the performance of core operating results between periods 
adjusted pre tax earnings  should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company results as reported under gaap 
cam through the cam subsidiary  we offer aircraft leasing to external customers and also lease aircraft internally to the company airlines 
aircraft leases normally cover a term of five to seven years 
in a typical leasing agreement  customers pay rent and maintenance deposits on a monthly basis 
as of december   cam had aircraft in serviceable condition  of them leased internally to the company airlines 
cam revenues grew million during compared to  as a result of additional aircraft leases over the last two years 
during  cam completed the modification of one boeing freighter aircraft and three boeing freighter aircraft  and placed those aircraft under leases with internal customers 
as of december  and  cam leased and aircraft to external customers  respectively 
revenues from 
table of contents external customers accounted for million of the increased revenue for  due primarily to four additional aircraft leases placed with external customers throughout during the fourth quarter of  a regional carrier returned a boeing aircraft to cam before the end of the original lease term 
the aircraft is being prepared for redeployment in acmi services 
cam revenues from the company airlines totaled million during  compared to million for cam revenues from internal leases of boeing and dc freighter aircraft for declined million compared to due to the retirement of boeing and dc aircraft previously operated for bax schenker  but the decline was more than offset by the additional boeing aircraft leases 
cam pre tax earnings  inclusive of an interest expense allocation and a million charge for aircraft impairment in  were million and million during and  respectively 
cam pre tax earnings  excluding the aircraft impairment charges  increased by million for compared to improved earnings reflected additional boeing aircraft placed under leases during and cam pre tax earnings for do not reflect million of unpaid rents related to boeing aircraft under lease with a regional airline 
those amounts will be recognized as we receive payment from the carrier 
management and the lessee are discussing the timing of future payments which could result in the early return of a leased boeing aircraft in during  we expect cam to deploy two more boeing and five aircraft that are being prepared for future deployment  as discussed further below under fleet summary the reputation of the boeing and boeing aircraft for reliability and cost effectiveness in medium range markets remains strong 
the placement of additional aircraft under long term leases  however  could be affected by economic conditions and market uncertainty 
acmi services segment the acmi services segment provides airline operations to its customers  typically under contracts providing for a combination of aircraft  crews  maintenance and insurance acmi 
our customers are usually responsible for supplying the necessary aviation fuel and cargo handling services and reimbursing our airline for other operating expenses  such as landing fees  ramp expenses and certain aircraft maintenance expenses 
aircraft charter agreements  including those for the us military  usually require the airline to provide full service  including fuel and other operating expenses for a fixed  all inclusive price 
as of december   acmi services included in service aircraft  including leased internally from cam  six leased from external providers and cam owned freighter aircraft which are under lease to dhl and operated by abx under the cmi agreement 
revenues from acmi services were million and million during and  respectively 
the decrease of million is primarily the result of the discontinuation of services for bax schenker north american air network 
since june   we have retired all of our boeing and dc freighter aircraft in response to the discontinuation of bax schenker north american air network in airline services revenues  which do not include revenues for the reimbursement of fuel and certain operating expenses  declined during compared to  reflecting the loss of bax schenker revenues of million during during  acmi services revenues also included million for the reimbursement of fuel and other operating expenses for the bax schenker air network 
revenue declines from bax schenker were partially offset by revenues from additional boeing aircraft added to the acmi services fleet since december  since december   acmi services has added two boeing and four boeing aircraft into the operating fleet 
airline service revenues  excluding those from bax schenker  increased million during compared to  driven by these additional boeing aircraft 
aircraft block hours flown for customers other than bax schenker increased during  compared to acmi services incurred pre tax losses of million during  compared to pre tax losses of million for excluding asset impairment charges of million incurred during  acmi services achieved pre tax earnings of million in the operating results during were negatively impacted by the discontinuation of bax schenker north american air network  the cost of training flight crew members for the boeing aircraft  increased pension expenses  higher engine maintenance expenses and delays in placing aircraft into revenue service 
while ati and ccia reduced the number of crew members and other employees in the acmi services segment due to the termination of the bax schenker network  salaries and benefits expenses during included the costs of training senior  former dc and boeing crewmembers for the boeing aircraft the boeing aircraft 

table of contents during  four boeing aircraft and two boeing aircraft were added into the acmi services in service fleet 
due to sluggish economic conditions  initial deployment and redeployment of aircraft into incremental revenue generating services were delayed  thereby adversely impacting operating results for in december  dhl discontinued an acmi contract for a boeing on a transatlantic flight 
however  in january  we reached agreements to operate three more boeing aircraft and a boeing aircraft for dhl us network 
these aircraft replace the boeing aircraft that were retired at the end of ati operates four dc combi aircraft for the us military 
in july  the us military air mobility command notified ati that it was awarded a two year agreement to continue the combi aircraft flights through september ati intends to service the award with its dc combi aircraft and phase in more modern boeing combi aircraft starting in the second quarter of to further streamline the operations impacted by the loss of the bax schenker business  we began to merge the airline operations of ati and ccia during in september  ati and ccia flight crewmembers  as represented by the air line pilots association international alpa  ratified a collective bargaining agreement which allows for an integrated seniority list 
the airlines and alpa completed the integration of the seniority lists in  to be effective beginning in march of we expect to complete the merger of ati and ccia airline operations in the first quarter of the combined operation will benefit from the standardized fleet  two person flight crew  common pilot type rating and improved reliability of the boeing and boeing aircraft compared to the boeing and dc freighter aircraft formerly operated by the airlines 
revenue for acmi services depends on a number of key factors including regulatory approvals  the cost competitiveness of the airlines  aircraft reliability  market preferences for the type of aircraft that we operate and general economic conditions 
continued stagnant economic conditions and market uncertainty may continue to slow the pace by which we deploy aircraft into incremental revenue operations 
we may further reduce staff levels as required to match with customer demand and aircraft utilization levels 
when new deployments of aircraft begin  typically start up expenses are incurred  including those for proving flights  route authorities  overfly rights  travel and other activities which may impact future operating results 
revenue generating service may begin sometime later  however  depending on the satisfaction of a number of conditions  including international regulations and laws  contract negotiations  flight crew availability  and arranging resources for aircraft handling 
other activities the company sells aircraft parts and provides aircraft maintenance and modification services to other airlines 
the company also operates five us postal service usps sorting facilities and provides ground support equipment  related maintenance  leasing and facility maintenance services  including fuel services 
other activities also include the management of workers compensation claims under an agreement with dhl and gains from the reduction in employee post retirement obligations 
external customer revenues from all other activities were million and million for and  respectively 
revenues from services provided to the usps increased million during primarily due to two additional usps facilities that we started in mid l 
increased revenues from the usps  however  were more than offset by lower aircraft maintenance revenues from external customers  which declined million 
maintenance services revenues for external customers declined during compared to because the company aircraft maintenance and repair business  airborne maintenance and engineering services  inc ames  has limited hangar facilities and used those facilities for more internal contracts for the company own airlines and cam instead of external customer projects during the pre tax earnings from other activities were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase of million of pre tax earnings for compared to primarily reflects process streamlining initiatives at the sorting facilities 
in  the company  as construction agent for the clinton county port authority ccpa in wilmington  ohio  began construction of a  square foot aircraft hangar facility adjacent to the existing aircraft maintenance facility currently utilized by ames 
while the current facility houses aircraft as large as the boeing  the new facility will provide ames the capability of servicing aircraft as large as a boeing and the boeing the hangar is anticipated 
table of contents to cost approximately million and is expected to take approximately to months to complete 
the company will lease the facility from the ccpa and begin to make related rent payments beginning in we could incur incremental costs associated with the new hangar  including the costs of aircraft maintenance personnel before the hangar is completed 
further  we will need to grow aircraft maintenance revenues utilizing the expanded hangar capabilities by expanding business with current customers and contracting with new customers 
our future operating results could be adversely impacted if anticipated revenues do not coincide with our costs of operating the new facility 
discontinued operations discontinued operations are a result of dhl decision in to restructure its us operations 
dhl discontinued us domestic pickup and delivery services and now provides only international services to and from the us in the third quarter of  abx ceased all remaining hub and parcel sorting operations for dhl 
additionally  in the third quarter of  dhl assumed management of aircraft fuel services for its us network previously provided by abx 
pre tax losses related to the former sorting operations were million for compared to million for the results of discontinued operations primarily contain pension expense for former employees that supported sort operations under a hub services agreement with dhl and expenses for certain legal matters associated with those former sorting operations 
during  the company recorded million of charges related to a civil action alleging that abx violated immigration labor laws while managing the sort operations in wilmington  ohio 
the matter is described further under item  legal proceedings  of this report 
during  pension expense for discontinued operations is expected to decrease approximately million due primarily to the effects of recent investment returns used to actuarially calculate the company annual pension expense

as of december   of cam boeing aircraft shown above were leased to dhl and operated by abx and cam leased the other seven boeing aircraft to external airlines 

table of contents aircraft fleet activity during is summarized below cam completed the standard freighter modification of one boeing aircraft and leased the aircraft internally to an airline affiliate 
a boeing passenger aircraft was placed in temporary storage when its airframe maintenance cycle expired 
the aircraft will remain in storage until it enters the freighter modification process or is prepped for service 
abx began to lease a boeing aircraft from an external lessor 
cam purchased two boeing passenger aircraft for modification into standard freighter aircraft 
cam completed the freighter modification of three boeing aircraft and leased the aircraft internally to an airline affiliate 
cam received a boeing aircraft  returned from a lessee  and placed the aircraft internally with an airline affiliate 
cam purchased a boeing combi aircraft that is completing the process for obtaining its airworthiness certificate 
we removed three dc freighter aircraft and four boeing aircraft from the in service fleet 
in  cam purchased two more boeing combi aircraft that are completing the process for airworthiness certification 
we expect to place four boeing combi aircraft into service for the us military during the first half of we also expect to complete the modification of one boeing freighter and place it into service for dhl during the first half of additionally  we expect to complete the modification of two boeing aircraft during the first half of as of december   the company had boeing and dc airframes and engines with a carrying value of million that were available for sale 
this carrying value is based on fair market values less the estimated costs to sell the airframes  engines and parts 
expenses from continuing operations salaries  wages and benefits expense decreased million during compared to reductions in the number of employees  including boeing and dc crew members  since were partially offset by costs of additional crew members for the expanded number of boeing aircraft operated by the company and by increased pension expense compared to pension expense for continuing operations increased million during when compared to due to the effects of lower discount rates used to actuarially calculate the company annual pension expense 
fuel expense decreased by million during compared to the decrease occurred in conjunction with bax schenker discontinuation of its north american air network in the fourth quarter of during  while under contract with bax schenker  ati provided aviation fuel for the bax schenker air network and was reimbursed by bax schenker for the costs of fuel 
the company is no longer incurring aviation fuel expenses or recording a related reimbursable revenue for the bax schenker network 
fuel expense during primarily reflects the costs of fuel to operate us military charters  position aircraft for service and for maintenance purposes 
maintenance  materials and repairs expense increased by million during compared to during  maintenance expense reductions stemming from the discontinuation of boeing aircraft and dc freighter aircraft since were offset by higher maintenance expenses to support the larger fleet of boeing and aircraft 
the company expensed and scheduled airframe heavy maintenance events during and  respectively  we expect aircraft maintenance expenses to increase in due to higher costs for aircraft parts and rate increases under certain maintenance agreements 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million during compared to the decline in depreciation expense reflects the removal of the boeing aircraft and the dc freighter aircraft from service  offset by incremental depreciation expense for four boeing aircraft added to the in service fleet since december the boeing aircraft and dc freighter aircraft were removed from service in conjunction with bax schenker 
table of contents discontinuation of its north american air network in travel expense decreased by million during compared to the decrease is a result of the discontinuation of the bax schenker north american air network in the fourth quarter of rent expense increased by million during compared to rent expense increased primarily due to the lease of an additional boeing aircraft beginning in may rent expense was not significantly affected by the discontinuation of the bax schenker north american air network because the company did not lease the aircraft used in that network 
landing and ramp expense  which includes the cost of deicing chemicals  decreased by million during compared to the decrease during reflects the discontinuation of the bax schenker north american air network in the fourth quarter of insurance expense decreased by million during compared to  primarily due to the reduction in boeing and dc aircraft during and the fourth quarter of other operating expenses include professional fees  navigational services  employee training  utilities and the cost of parts sold to customers 
other operating expenses decreased by million during compared to during  increased expenses for international aircraft operations were offset by lower costs stemming from the discontinuation of the bax schenker north american air network 
interest expense increased by million during compared to interest expense was higher in compared to primarily due to an increase in the amount of borrowings under the revolving credit loan offset by lower interest rates 
interest rates on the company s variable interest  unsubordinated term loan decreased to at december  from at december  we expect interest expense to increase during due to a higher level of debt which is being used to expand the company aircraft fleet 
during  the company recorded pre tax net gains on derivatives of million compared to pre tax net losses on derivatives of million during  reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates since december  on the interest rate swaps held by the company at december  in  the company executed a senior credit agreement replacing its previous credit agreement 
during  the company wrote off million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the former credit agreement 
during  the company terminated its hedge accounting of interest rate swaps related to the former term loan  which resulted in the recognition of million of pre tax losses which had previously been reflected in other comprehensive income 
the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended december  was compared to for the effective tax rate from continuing operations in was affected by impairment charges that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
the company effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately for the year ended december  after adjusting for million of non deductible impairment charges 
the decline in the effective tax rate from continuing operations for compared to was also a result of decreased state income taxes for as a result of the the discontinuation of services for bax schenker north american air network during we estimate that the company effective tax rate for will be approximately 
as of december   the company had operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which will begin to expire in if not utilized before then 
we expect to utilize the loss carryforwards to offset federal income tax liabilities in the future 
as a result  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes through or later 
the company may  however  be required to pay alternative minimum taxes and certain state and local income taxes before then 
the company taxable income earned from international flights are primarily sourced to the united states under international aviation agreements and treaties 
if we begin to operate in countries without such agreements  the company could incur additional foreign income taxes 
compared to summary the consolidated net earnings from continuing operations were million and million for and  respectively 
the pre tax earnings from continuing operations for were million  inclusive of asset impairment 
table of contents charges and interest rate derivative losses during  compared to pre tax earnings of million in  in which no impairment charges or derivative losses were recorded 
the decline in earnings from continuing operations in as compared to resulted primarily from the recognition of asset impairment charges of million  interest rate derivative losses of million and the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of the company debt in adjusted pre tax earnings from continuing operations  a non gaap measure see reconciliation table below  after removing impairment charges  net derivative losses and charges related to debt refinancing was million for compared to million for after removing pre tax earnings related to dhl restructuring 
the improved earnings  as adjusted  over  was driven primarily by cam  which placed five additional aircraft under external customer leases since december  the company provided limited airlift directly to bax schenker from september through the peak delivery season  until late december beginning in january  dhl contracted with the company airlines to supplement dhl us air network to service bax schenker freight volumes on its expanded air network without use of the company dc aircraft and with only limited use of boeing aircraft 
the company impairment charges in stemming from bax schenker transition to a new us business model are described below million million after income tax benefit to write down boeing and dc freighters  engines and related parts to their appraised fair values 
in light of bax schenker decision to phase out its dedicated air network in the us and after evaluating business prospects for these aircraft  management has decided to discontinue the service of boeing and dc freighters sooner than previously expected 
million million after income tax benefit to write down customer relationship intangible assets  reflecting the closure of bax schenker dedicated air network 
million million after income tax benefit to write down goodwill acquired when the company purchased ati  which operated the dc aircraft for bax schenker 
the write down reflects the lower forecasted cash flows in the near term as ati re fleets by replacing the dc aircraft operated for bax schenker with more efficient boeing and aircraft to be operated for other customers 
during  the company executed a senior credit agreement with a consortium of banks 
the senior credit agreement refinanced the company previous term loan and provides liquidity to expand the company aircraft fleet through april the senior credit agreement includes a term loan of million and a million revolving credit facility  of which the company has drawn million  net of repayments

liquidity the company has a senior credit agreement with a consortium of banks that includes an unsuborinated term loan of million and a revolving credit facility from which the company has drawn million  net of repayments as of december  on july   the company executed the first amendment to the senior credit agreement credit amendment 
the credit amendment increased the amount available under the revolving credit facility by million to million  extended the maturity of the term loan and revolving credit facility to july   and provided for an accordion feature whereby the company may draw up to an additional million  subject to the lenders consent 
if the company exercises the accordion feature  the same terms and conditions of the senior credit agreement would apply to the accordion feature and additional collateral would need to be posted to maintain the collateral coverage requirement 
the additional debt may result in higher interest rates 
under the senior credit agreement  interest rates are adjusted quarterly based on the prevailing libor or prime rates and a ratio of the company outstanding debt level to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses ebitda

table of contents maintain collateral coverage equal to of the outstanding balance of the term loan and the total revolving credit facility 
under the senior credit agreement  the company is subject to covenants and warranties that are usual and customary  including among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  as well as a total debt to ebitda ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the senior credit agreement stipulates events of default including unspecified events that may have a material adverse effect on the company 
if an event of default occurs  the company may be forced to repay  renegotiate or replace the senior credit agreement

off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
certain of our operating leases and agreements contain indemnification obligations to the lessor or one or more other parties that are considered usual and customary eg use  tax and environmental indemnifications  the terms of which range in duration and are often limited

no amounts have been recognized in our financial statements for the underlying fair value of guarantees and indemnifications 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as certain disclosures included elsewhere in this report  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to select appropriate accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies 
in certain cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques which could be selected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our selection of policies and the estimation techniques we use  including those related to revenue recognition  post retirement liabilities  bad debts  self insurance reserves  valuation of spare parts inventory  useful lives  salvage values and impairment of property and equipment  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those factors form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following significant and critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues generated from airline service agreements are typically recognized based on hours flown or the amount of aircraft and crew resources provided during a reporting period 
certain agreements include provisions for incentive payments based upon on time reliability 
these incentives are typically measured on a monthly basis and recorded to revenue in the corresponding month earned 
revenues for operating expenses that are reimbursed through customer agreements  including consumption of aircraft fuel  are generally recognized as the costs are incurred 
revenues from 
table of contents charter service agreements are recognized on scheduled and non scheduled flights when the specific flight has been completed 
revenues from the sale of aircraft parts are recognized when the parts are delivered 
revenues earned and expenses incurred in providing aircraft related maintenance  repair or technical services are recognized in the period in which the services are completed and delivered to the customer 
revenues derived from transporting freight and sorting parcels are recognized upon delivery of shipments and completion of services 
aircraft lease revenues are recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreements 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we assess in the fourth quarter of each year whether the company s goodwill acquired in acquisitions is impaired 
additional assessments may be performed on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators occur 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives and are periodically reviewed for impairment 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill 
the company has two reporting units  ati and cam  that have goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of ati and cam separately using a market approach and an income approach utilizing discounted cash flows applied to a market derived rate of return 
the market approach utilizes market multiples from comparable publicly traded companies 
the market multiples include revenues  ebit earnings before interest and taxes  ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitdar earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent 
we derive cash flow assumptions from many factors including recent market trends  expected revenues  cost structure  aircraft maintenance schedules and long term strategic plans for the deployment of aircraft 
key assumptions under the discounted cash flow models include projections for the number of aircraft in service  capital expenditures  long term growth rates  operating cash flows and market derived discount rates 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step is performed 
in the second step  fair values are assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference and charged to operations 
we have used the assistance of an independent business valuation firm in estimating an expected market rate of return  and in the development of a market approach for ati and cam using multiples of ebitdar  ebitda  ebit and revenues from comparable publicly traded companies 
based on our analysis  as of december   cam fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than and ati fair value exceeded its carrying value by 
the company key assumptions used for goodwill testing include uncertainties 
those uncertainties include the level of demand for cargo aircraft by shippers  the us military and freight forwarders and cam ability to lease aircraft near expected modification completion dates 
we anticipate that cam will successfully modify two boeing freighter aircraft over the next year and place them under long term lease agreements 
we anticipate that cam will successfully complete the modification of four boeing aircraft into combi configuration and one boeing aircraft to standard freighter configuration and that ati will deploy them over the next year 
we expect that ati will operate four combi aircraft for the us military and that ati will operate four boeing aircraft and eight boeing aircraft for dhl and other customers 
the demand for customer airlift is projected based on input from customers  the volume of bids requested by the us military  management interface with customer planning personnel and aircraft utilization trends 
certain events or changes in circumstances could negatively impact our key assumptions 
customer preferences for cargo aircraft may be impacted by changes in aviation fuel prices 
key customers  including the us military  may decide that they do not need as many aircraft as projected  or they may find alternative airlift 
the company finite lived intangible asset is for customer relationships acquired with ati 
this asset is amortized over the estimated useful economic life and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the fair value of the asset was derived using projected revenues from existing customers and related attrition rates using the guidance under fasb asc topic property  plant 
table of contents and equipment  and separately from a discounted cash flow model used for goodwill impairment 
the projected net cash flows attributed to existing customers were discounted using an estimated cost of capital  based on market participant assumptions 
long lived assets aircraft and other long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors which may cause an impairment include termination of aircraft from a customer network  extended operating cash flow losses from the assets and management decisions regarding the future use of assets 
to conduct impairment testing  the company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for assets that are to be held and used  impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset group is less than the carrying value 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the assets down to fair value  and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value 
fair values are determined considering quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
depreciation depreciation of property and equipment is provided on a straight line basis over the lesser of an asset s useful life or lease term 
we periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and equipment 
the acceleration of depreciation expense or the recording of significant impairment losses could result from changes in the estimated useful lives of our assets 
we may change the estimated useful lives due to a number of reasons  such as the existence of excess capacity in our air networks  or changes in regulations grounding or limiting the use of aircraft 
self insurance we self insure certain claims related to workers compensation  aircraft  automobile  general liability and employee healthcare 
we record a liability for reported claims and an estimate for incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
accruals for these claims are estimated utilizing historical paid claims data and recent claims trends 
changes in claim severity and frequency could result in actual claims being materially different than the costs provided for in our results of operations 
we maintain excess claim coverage with common insurance carriers to mitigate our exposure to large claim losses 
contingencies we are involved in legal matters that have a degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these matters and the adequacy of amounts  if any  provided for these matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not differ materially from our assessment of them 
there also can be no assurance that we know all matters that may be brought against us at any point in time 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of fasb asc topic income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of expected future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
the company has significant deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards nol cfs for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in based upon projections of taxable income  we determined that it was more likely than not that the nol cf s will be realized prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we do not have an allowance against these deferred tax assets at this time 
we recognize the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 

table of contents post retirement obligations the company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans for abx s flight crewmembers and other eligible employees 
the company also sponsors non qualified  unfunded excess plans that provide benefits to executive management and crewmembers that are in addition to amounts permitted to be paid through our qualified plans under provisions of the tax laws 
employees are no longer accruing benefits under any of the defined benefit pension plans 
the company also sponsors unfunded post retirement healthcare plans for abx s flight crewmembers and non flight crewmember employees 
the accounting and valuation for these post retirement obligations are determined by prescribed accounting and actuarial methods that consider a number of assumptions and estimates 
the selection of appropriate assumptions and estimates is significant due to the long time period over which benefits will be accrued and paid 
the long term nature of these benefit payouts increases the sensitivity of certain estimates on our post retirement costs 
in actuarially valuing our pension obligations and determining related expense amounts  assumptions we consider most sensitive are discount rates and expected long term investment returns on plan assets 
other assumptions concerning retirement ages and mortality also affect the valuations 
actual results and future changes in these assumptions could result in future costs that are materially different than those recorded in our annual results of operations 
our actuarial valuation includes an assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 
our assumed rate of return is based on a targeted long term investment allocation of equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate 
the actual asset allocation at december  was equities  fixed income  real estate and cash 
the pension trust includes million of investments of the plans assets whose fair values have been estimated in the absence of readily determinable fair values 
such investments include private equity  hedge fund investments and real estate funds 
management s estimates are based on information provided by the fund managers or general partners of those funds 
in evaluating our assumptions regarding expected long term investment returns on plan assets  we consider a number of factors  including our historical plan returns in connection with our asset allocation policies  assistance from investment consultants hired to provide oversight over our actively managed investment portfolio and long term inflation assumptions 
the selection of the expected return rate materially affects our pension costs 
our expected long term rate of return remained at after analyzing expected returns on investment vehicles and considering our long term asset allocation expectations 
if we were to lower our long term rate of return assumption by a hypothetical basis points  expense in would be increased by approximately million 
we use a market value of assets as of the measurement date for determining pension expense 
in selecting the interest rate to discount estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date to their net present value defined as the projected benefit obligation  we match the plan s benefit payment streams to high quality bonds of similar maturities 
the selection of the discount rate not only affects the reported funded status information as of december as shown in note h to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  but also affects the succeeding year s pension and post retirement healthcare costs 
the discount rates selected for december   based on the method described above  were 
if we were to lower our discount rates by a hypothetical basis points  pension expense in would be increased by approximately million 
the assumed future increase in salaries and wages is no longer a significant estimate in determining pension costs because each defined benefit pension plan was frozen during with respect to additional benefit accruals 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the aforementioned assumptions on our pension expense  pension obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income in thousands effect of change december  change in assumption pension expense pension obligation accumulated other comprehensive income pre tax basis point decrease in rate of return basis point decrease in discount rate aggregate effect of all the above changes 
table of contents discontinued operations in accordance with the guidance of fasb asc topic presentation of financial statements  a business component whose operations are discontinued is reported as discontinued operations if the cash flows of the component have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company and the company will no longer have any significant continuing involvement in the business component 
the results of discontinued operations are aggregated and presented separately in the consolidated statement of operations 
fasb asc topic requires the reclassification of amounts presented for prior years to reflect their classification as discontinued operations 
exit activities we account for the costs associated with exit activities in accordance with fasb asc topic exit or disposal cost obligations 
one time  involuntary employee termination benefits are generally expensed when the company communicates the benefit arrangement to the employee that it will no longer require the services of the employee beyond a minimum retention period 
liabilities for contract termination costs associated with exit activities are recognized in the period incurred and measured initially at fair value 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  asu 
asu enhances disclosures regarding financial instruments and derivative instruments 
entities are required to provide both net information and gross information for these assets and liabilities 
this new guidance is to be applied retrospectively beginning in the company anticipates that the adoption of this standard will expand its consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures 
in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  asu 
asu is a revised standard which provides entities with the option to first use an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
if a conclusion is reached that the indefinite lived intangible asset fair value is not more likely than not below carrying value  no further impairment testing is necessary 
this revised guidance applies to fiscal years beginning after september   and the related interim and annual goodwill impairment tests 
the company does not believe this standard will have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements

the senior credit agreement includes a term loan of million 
on july   the company executed the first amendment to the senior credit agreement credit amendment 
the credit amendment increased the amount available under the revolving credit loan by million  extended the maturity of the term loan and revolving credit loan to july   and provided for an accordion feature whereby the company may draw up to an additional million  subject to the lenders consent 
under the terms of the senior credit agreement  interest rates will be adjusted quarterly based on the company earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses ebitda  its outstanding debt level and prevailing libor or prime rates see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the company senior credit agreement requires the company to maintain derivative instruments for fluctuating interest rates  for at least fifty percent of the outstanding balance of the new unsubordinated term loan 
accordingly  in july  the company entered into a new interest rate swap instrument 
as a result  future fluctuations in libor interest rates will result in the recording of unrealized gains and losses on interest rate derivatives held by the company 
the notional values were million as of december  see note j in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting treatment for these hedging transactions 
as of december   the company has million of fixed interest rate debt and million of variable interest rate debt outstanding 
variable interest rate debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in annual cash 
table of contents flows resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a change in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  the debt issued at fixed interest rates is exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
fixed interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the increase in fair value of our long term debt through a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
as of december   a increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt by approximately million 
the company is exposed to concentration of credit risk primarily through cash deposits  cash equivalents  marketable securities and derivatives 
as part of our risk management process  we monitor and evaluate the credit standing of the financial institutions with which we do business 
the financial institutions with which we do business are generally highly rated 
the company is exposed to counterparty risk  which is the loss we could incur if a counterparty to a derivative contract defaulted 
at december   abx defined benefit pension plans had total investment assets of million under investment management
