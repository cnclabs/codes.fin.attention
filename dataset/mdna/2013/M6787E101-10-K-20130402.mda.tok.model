all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statement amounts to conform to the current presentation 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
such estimates and judgments are revised periodically as required 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts  the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  income tax valuation allowance and related matters  the value of ordinary shares issued in business combinations or underlying the company s ordinary share options  the expected forfeitures of ordinary share options and estimates of likely outcomes related to certain contingent liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
our estimates and assumptions are based on factors such as historical experience  trends within the company and the telecommunications industry  general economic conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of such assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available 
actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions as a result of varying market and economic conditions  and may result in lower revenues and lower operating income 
critical accounting policies we have identified below our critical accounting policies 
these policies are both the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenues consists of revenue from sales of the magicjack and magicjack plus to retailers  wholesalers or directly to customers  access rights fees  fees charged for shipping the magicjack and magicjack plus  usage of prepaid minutes  access charges to other carriers and other miscellaneous charges for telecommunication usage  sales of telecommunications hardware  software and related services 
revenue is recorded net of sales returns and allowances 
magicjack and magicjack plus revenue we recognize revenues from sales and shipping of direct sales of the magicjack and magicjack plus over the period associated with the initial month access right period 
customers may purchase access rights for continued use of our software to access our servers for additional years either when the original purchase is made  or at any time thereafter 
the revenue associated with the access right for additional years is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended access right period 
sales return policy we offer some of our direct sales customers a day free trial before they have to pay for their magicjack or magicjack plus unit 
we do not record or recognize revenue until the day trial period has expired and a customer s credit card has been charged 
returns from retailers are accepted on an authorized basis for devices deemed defective 
we may offer certain retailers the limited right to return any unsold merchandise from their initial stocking orders 
we estimate potential returns under these arrangements at point of sale based and re estimate potential returns on a quarterly basis 
for the year ended december   and  our estimates of returns and actual returns from initial stocking orders have not been materially different 
telephony services revenue telephony revenue is recognized as minutes are used 
telephony revenue is generated from the usage of prepaid minutes  fees for origination of calls to numbers  access fees charged to other telecommunication carriers on a per minute basis for interexchange carriers ixc calls terminated on our servers  and wholesaling telephone service to voip providers and telecommunication carriers 
we have estimated and provided allowances for billing adjustments of access charges to carrier customers 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that it estimates is more likely than not to be realized 
we assess our income tax positions for uncertainty and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those uncertain tax positions where there is a greater than likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained but possibly subject to adjustment by the relevant taxing authority  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that management believes may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those uncertain income tax positions where there is or less likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
share based compensation share based compensation generally consists of option grants or ordinary share awards to directors  officers  employees or consultants 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity based payment awards on the date of grant based on the fair value of the award 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated income statements 
the company has not granted stock options since the number and value of options granted in were not material 
since  the company stock based compensation has been in the form of ordinary shares

the increases in the components of net revenues were primarily attributable to the following a million combined increase in revenues recognized for the sale of the magicjack and magicjack plus  primarily as a result of i the recognition of revenues on sales of the magicjack plus  which started in september  ii higher average unit prices of magicjack plus units  and iii a higher proportionate number of magicjack plus units being sold directly to consumers at retail prices as opposed to the number of units sold to retailers and distributors at wholesale prices  a million increase in renewal revenues primarily as a result of the impact of price increases effective in early  a million increase in the sale of magicjack related products  primarily driven by the increase in porting fees  a million increase in revenues from prepaid minutes primarily as a result of the company making an operational change in february which allowed it to identify the point in time when prepaid minutes expire under the terms of service  resulting in approximately million attributable to prepaid minutes that expired between february and february being recognized as revenue  a million increase in shipping and handling revenues primarily as a result of the company commencing to sell the magicjack plus in september  and a million increase in revenues from access and wholesale charges 
these increases in components of net revenue were partially offset by a million decrease in non core other revenues as a result of reduced sales of telecommunications hardware and our proprietary software as we discontinued efforts to acquire new customers for such products in order to focus on our internal needs

the cost of other revenues decreased by million primarily due to i a decrease in vocaltec us and israel costs as a result of a lower hardware cost as we discontinued efforts to acquire new customers for such products  and ii a reduction in depreciation expense resulting from a change in estimated useful lives of certain servers effective january   offset in part by higher amortization expense as a result of certain intangible assets being purchased in operating expenses total operating expenses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to i a million decrease in advertising related expense driven by a reduction in long form advertising and sponsorship related expenses  ii a million decrease in general and administrative expenses resulting from a million decrease in legal expenses as a result of fewer legal cases  offset in part by higher personnel related costs primarily as a result of higher bonuses to employees and outside consultants in because of successful results 
we believe we will be able to reduce legal expenses related to collection efforts and litigation in future periods due to i certain upcoming expected legal settlements  and ii more certainty for rules regarding billing and collections of access charges as a result of the fcc order of november  our combined advertising related expenses decreased by approximately for the year ended december  as compared to december  because the legacy value of our short and long form advertising did not require continued reinforcement 
our combined advertising related expenses remained flat for the both the years ended december  and advertising related expenses have varied  and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter

the principal components of our income taxes for the years ended december  and are the following in thousands year ended december  income loss before taxes income tax benefit expense effective income tax rate we have had low income taxes because of the offset of operating loss carryovers from earlier years of operation against income loss before income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   primarily related to the release of million of our valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of as of december   we provided a full valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets as we then believed the objective and verifiable evidence of our historical pre tax losses outweighed the existing positive evidence regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to recover certain deferred tax assets by generating future taxable income 
accordingly  we released a portion of our valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of going forward  we expect that our effective tax rate will increase in the future 
the actual amount of the effective tax rate in the future will be affected by various factors  including our future profitability and the realization of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets recovered from future taxable income 
we will review our deferred tax valuation allowance on a quarterly basis

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this update applies to annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  under asu  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments in asu are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not impact the company consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu amends topic by establishing an optional two step analysis for impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles other than goodwill 
asu is intended to simplify impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill by adding a qualitative review step to assess whether the required quantitative impairment analysis that exists today is necessary 
under the amended rule  a company will not be required to calculate the fair value of a business that contains recorded indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill unless it concludes  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of that business is less than its book value 
if such a decline in fair value is deemed more likely than not to have occurred  then the quantitative impairment test that exists under current gaap must be completed 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  and early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not impact the company consolidated financial statements
