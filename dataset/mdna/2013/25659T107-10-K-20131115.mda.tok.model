executive summary at the beginning of fiscal  we highlighted several priorities that we planned to focus on during the year 
the following represents a summary of our progress made in these priority areas to date mobile 
we expanded the use of our technologies in high end smartphones and tablets  further establishing our strong position across the mobile ecosystem 
in the windows ecosystem  our technologies are embedded in the windows operating system for tablets and pcs  and netflix is now sending dolby enabled content to select windows devices 
in the android ecosystem  our technologies are now on a growing share of smartphones and tablets  and various service providers send dolby enabled content to android devices 
likewise  in the amazon ecosystem  amazon instant video is distributing movies and tv shows with dolby digital plus soundtracks to various kindle models 
broadcast 
in broadcast  we strengthened our position as the adopted standard in digital television and high definition content in north america and throughout much of europe 
we also extended the use of our technologies in a number of emerging markets 
in china  new operators have adopted dolby digital plus in their set top boxes and we estimate that dolby technologies are deployed in over half of the high definition channels on air in china 
in addition  several new operators in malaysia  vietnam and the philippines adopted dolby digital plus in their set top boxes 
our technologies are now featured in a number of over the top services including itunes  netflix  amazon  hbo go  vudu  and cinema now 
additionally  target has included our technology in target ticket  their new digital video service that launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal cinema 
we began shipping and generating revenues from dolby atmos  an object oriented platform that provides precision and flexibility in sound placement to deliver the most natural and realistic experience in a cinema environment 
as of september   over seventy five dolby atmos movie titles have been released or announced by the major hollywood studios as well as by international distributors  and more than three hundred atmos enabled screens have been installed or are committed for installment 
the following is a sampling of some of the more notable titles that have been or will be shown in dolby atmos title release date distributor life of pi november th century fox the hobbit an unexpected journey december warner bros

thor the dark world november disney the hunger games catching fire november lions gate the hobbit the desolation of smaug december warner bros 
new solutions 
we continued to develop new technologies and solutions including the following dolby voice 
dolby voice is one of our newest offerings 
it represents an audio conferencing solution that enables virtual meetings to sound and feel more like in person meetings 
during this past year  we announced a global partnership with bt  a leading provider of audio and video conferencing solutions 
as part of this arrangement  bt will incorporate dolby voice into their offerings under a limited exclusivity period 
in october  bt launched their bt meetme with dolby voice service which will be available to customers worldwide 

table of contents dolby d for the home 
in association with philips and the cameron pace group cpg led by director james cameron  dolby entered into an agreement to integrate the dolby d format into cpg d video content production workflow 
we believe that glasses free d presentation in the home can be improved by using the dolby d format and we are developing products and solutions aimed at this potential market 
opportunities  challenges  and risks today  content is captured  delivered  and played back in more ways than ever before 
consumers access content at will and on the go through multiple channels  including cinema  optical disc  digital broadcast  wired internet  and cellular networks 
as consumers are presented with more options for receiving content  competition across delivery channels has intensified 
as such  our licensing and product markets are characterized by rapid technological changes  new product introductions  changing customer and licensee demands and evolving industry standards that present a high risk of obsolescence 
however  we believe that these changes also present us with opportunities to provide realistic and multi channel audio  video and communications experiences to consumers through new and emerging delivery channels 
licensing the following table presents the composition of our licensing business and revenues for all periods presented fiscal year ended market september  september  september  main products incorporating our technologies broadcast televisions and set top boxes pc microsoft windows operating systems and dvd software players consumer electronics dvd and blu ray disc players and recorders  audio video receivers  and home theater in a box systems mobile smartphones  tablets and other mobile devices other video game consoles  automotive in car dvd players total content creators and distributors are increasingly focused on delivering content for online consumption across a multitude of media and devices with varying bandwidth and performance capabilities  including pcs  connected tvs  set top boxes  gaming consoles  connected blu ray disc players  and various mobile devices 
many mobile devices now designed for enhanced capture and playback present a challenge for content creators and device manufacturers seeking consistent audio quality 
we believe this challenge provides opportunities whereby we can provide solutions to optimize the audio experience across the online and portable device markets 
with the continued evolution of consumer entertainment choices and our efforts to provide competitive audio and video technologies for a wide variety of devices  the composition of our optical and non optical based licensing revenue has changed 
our optical disc based revenue is generated from the licensing of technologies that enable dvd or blu ray disc playback  including those incorporated in the microsoft windows and operating systems  independent pc dvd software players  and consumer dvd and blu ray disc players 
non optical disc based licensing revenue includes revenue derived from products such as tvs  set top boxes  and mobile phones  as well as our post processing technologies on a range of devices 
the portion of our total licensing revenue comprised of our non optical disc based licensing has been increasing over time  as shown in the following table fiscal year ended licensing revenue september  september  september  non optical optical broadcast market in our broadcast market we derive the majority of our revenue from licensing our technologies to oems of televisions and set top boxes 
the efficiency and quality of our multichannel technologies are well suited to digital broadcast bandwidth requirements and to delivering a premium hd content experience 
as evidenced by the high percentage of global sales of tv and set top boxes shipped with our technologies  we continue to maintain strong market share 

table of contents as countries within emerging markets convert to digital television  we are well positioned to benefit from this transition  and our growth in this market is dependent in part upon continued adoption of our technologies 
broadcast services that operate under bandwidth constraints  such as terrestrial broadcast or internet protocol television iptv services  benefit from dolby technologies  which enable the delivery of high quality audio content at reduced bit rates  thereby conserving bandwidth 
pc market our technologies are in the majority of pcs sold today due to their incorporation in microsoft windows for disc and online content playback and  for versions prior to windows  primarily because of their inclusion in dvd and blu ray disc playback functionality 
historically  we have licensed our technologies to a range of pc licensees  including independent software vendors isv  pc oems  and operating system providers 
the release of new versions of major pc operating systems has sometimes resulted in changes in the mix of our pc licensees 
the impact on us from the transition to windows will depend on several factors  including the extent to which windows is adopted  unit shipments in the marketplace  and our direct licensing relationships with pc oems 
consumer electronics ce market our ce market is primarily driven by revenue attributable to dvd and blu ray disc players and recorders 
sales of dvd players are declining as a result of the maturity of the dvd platform and a shift to blu ray players and other connected devices capable of delivering content 
the decline in dvd revenue is only partially offset by revenue from blu ray players which have not reached the annual volumes generated by dvd players in prior periods 
this is in part due to the large number of competing products and services that currently deliver content over the internet 
mobile market our mobile market is largely driven by sales of smartphones and tablet devices that incorporate our technologies 
our growth in this market is dependent not only on the performance of the mobile device market as a whole  but also on our success of collaborating with manufacturers of mobile devices to incorporate our technologies 
currently  these devices include various android smartphones and tablets  certain amazon kindle models  and microsoft windows smartphones and tablets 
however  the rate of new product development in this sector is rapid and can result in dramatic swings in consumer adoption trends 
as a result  we must continue to align our technologies with a shifting array of mobile devices in order to maintain and grow the use of our solutions in mobile devices 
other markets revenue generated from our other markets typically stems from gaming devices and peripherals  automotive and licensing services 
revenue attributable to gaming and automotive is primarily driven by sales of video game consoles and in car entertainment systems that incorporate our dolby digital  dolby digital plus  aac  and dolby truehd technologies 
licensing services revenue  from the administration of our patent pools through our wholly owned subsidiary via licensing corporation  is primarily driven by demand for standards based audio compression technologies for broadcast  ce  and mobile products 
products the following table presents the composition of our products revenue for all periods presented fiscal year ended market september  september  september  cinema broadcast other total revenue from our cinema products tends to fluctuate based on the underlying trends in the cinema industry  including technology adoption and replacement cycles 
one such significant trend is the industry transition from film based to digital cinema  the latter of which eliminates film printing and distribution costs  combats piracy and 
table of contents enables repeated movie playback without image or audio degradation 
digital cinema products our cinema products include our digital audio processor that provides multichannel surround playback for our digital cinema servers  screen server and central library server for the storage and playback of digital content  as well as our dolby digital cinema integrated media block imb which performs audio and video decoding and playback 
as the market for digital cinema servers and related equipment has become increasingly competitive and the industry transition from film to digital nears completion  revenue from our cinema products will likely further decline until the industry s replacement cycle reverses this trend 
we will need to manage our products through such a decline 
our dolby atmos object oriented sound platform  introduced last year  enhances the cinema experience and provides more flexibility and control for sound designers and mixers to deliver more natural and realistic sound 
to date  no standards exist for object audio playback in cinema  however both the north american theatre owners nato and digital cinema initiative dci  a group representing the top hollywood studios  have encouraged the development of an industry standard for object oriented audio 
we will continue to collaborate with these industry participants since the outcome may impact future adoption of our products 
digital d products our digital cinema d products for cinema provide d image capabilities when combined with a digital cinema projector and server 
our revenue in this area has been negatively impacted by declines in unit shipments and lower selling prices for d products  as the market for d cinema equipment has become increasingly competitive and the adoption rate of new d screens has slowed considerably 
broadcast products our broadcast products are used to encode  transmit  and decode multiple channels of high quality audio content for dtv and hdtv program production and broadcast distribution and to measure the subjective loudness of audio content within broadcast programming 
since our broadcast products support the use of our encoding technologies  revenue from these products will increase or decline commensurate with the adoption of our encoding technologies especially in new and emerging markets 
film based products our film cinema products are used primarily to read  decode  and play back film soundtracks  to calibrate cinema sound systems  and to enable soundtracks encoded in digital audio to be played back on analog cinema audio systems 
as the cinema industry has increasingly adopted digital based formats  revenue from our film cinema products has declined  and we anticipate this decline to continue 
services services revenue is primarily tied to activity in the cinema industry  and has been adversely impacted by the industry transition from film to digital based production 
services are also dependent upon the volume of film production by studios and independent filmmakers 
several factors influence the number of movies produced in a given fiscal period  including strikes and work stoppages within the cinema industry and budgetary constraints and changes in cinema industry business models 
our services revenue continues to face significant competition from full service post production companies 
strategic initiatives developing voice technologies with the growth of voice transmission over internet protocol networks and the proliferation of devices that connect to these networks  we believe the quality of the voice experience can often be less than desirable 
our expertise in sound signal processing and compression technologies addresses some of the inherent shortcomings and provides noticeable improvement in voice quality and clarity 
however  new or existing competitor technologies could adversely affect our ability to penetrate  grow and sustain market share in this industry 

table of contents developing video technologies our success in audio has resulted in part from our ability to develop and deliver the products  services  tools  and technologies needed to deliver a consistent  high quality audio experience across multiple channels 
we believe these core competencies can be applied to video to significantly improve the technology currently used to deliver premium video to displays 
in the cinema market  we offer exhibitors our digital cinema servers and d digital cinema products  which deliver a vivid movie experience with sharp images and natural colors 
we also offer a professional reference monitor  a flat panel video reference display for post production professionals 
these professionals use our monitor for critical tasks  such as calibrating color accuracy to professional reference standards 
our professional reference monitor uses our dynamic range imaging technologies  which compared to competing products  enable enhanced contrast  extended brightness and dynamic range  along with reduced power consumption in led backlit televisions 
building on the strength of the dolby brand we are building on the strength of the dolby brand among consumers and our reputation among licensees and customers as a trusted provider of high quality sound and imaging technologies 
our solutions are critical to providing high quality audio and video experiences in the cinema  home  at work or on the go 
we actively encourage our customers to place our trademarks on their products in conjunction with the inclusion of our technologies 
the inclusion of the dolby trademark on a product informs audiences and consumers that the product incorporates our technologies and meets our quality standards  and we believe this helps oems sell their products 
we will continue to encourage the use of our trademarks throughout the entertainment industry as an indicator to both professionals and consumers of consistently high quality 
addressing ongoing content creator needs technology innovations for entertainment are often adopted first for professional use  as filmmakers  music producers  broadcasters  and video game designers look for ways to excite their audiences 
we are collaborating with industry professionals to develop new technologies that facilitate and improve content recording  distribution  and playback 
our professional solutions often have applicability to the consumer arena  and when they apply  we intend to continue to adapt these technologies for use in consumer applications 
our noise reduction  multichannel sound  and digital audio technologies were all initially developed for professional use and later adapted for use in consumer products 
we believe that our success in developing technologies for professional use contributes greatly to the appeal of our technologies and brand for consumer use 
promoting the adoption of dolby technologies in industry standards as the entertainment industry develops technical standards for content creation  delivery  and playback  we are often actively involved in those efforts  and we seek to have our technologies included in industry standards 
we actively develop  maintain  and strengthen relationships across the broad spectrum of entertainment industry participants  professional organizations  and global standards setting bodies 
revenue from significant customers revenue from samsung represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  and consisted primarily of licensing revenue from our mobile and broadcast markets 
revenue from samsung did not exceed of our total revenue in the prior periods presented 
although revenue from microsoft did not exceed of our total revenue in fiscal  revenue from microsoft did represent approximately and of our total revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and included licensing revenue from our pc  ce  and other markets 
under the windows licensing agreement  we now receive certain royalties directly from pc oems  which differs from the prior windows arrangement where these royalties came from microsoft 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  and pursuant to securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to establish accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if it is both important to a company s financial condition and or results of operations and requires significant judgment on the part of management in its application 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgment  and estimates 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this annual report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies and estimates listed below to be the most critical due to both their importance on our financial condition and results of operations and the level of management judgment required 
if actual results or events differ materially  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected 
historically  our estimates and assumptions have not significantly differed from actual results 
the estimates and or assumptions relevant to these critical policies have not significantly changed in recent years  nor do we anticipate them to significantly change in the future 
for additional information describing all of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements  refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  while further information regarding the potential risks to our future results of operations are included within risk factors in part i  item a of this form k 
goodwill  intangible assets  and long lived assets description we test goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
our intangible assets principally consist of acquired technology  patents  trademarks  customer relationships and contracts  which are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives ranging from three to seventeen years 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying value to the total future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
judgments and uncertainties beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of the fasb recently issued accounting standard asu which permits the execution of a qualitative assessment as a determinant for whether the two step annual goodwill impairment test should be performed 
in performing our annual goodwill impairment test  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill test 
in performing the qualitative assessment  we consider events and circumstances  including but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  changes in management or key personnel  changes in strategy  changes in customers  changes in the composition or carrying amount of a reporting unit net assets and changes in the price of our common stock 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then the two step goodwill impairment test is not performed 
if the two step goodwill test is performed  we evaluate and test our goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level using expected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the calculated fair value of the goodwill 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below 

table of contents revenue recognition description we enter into revenue arrangements with our customers to license technologies  trademarks and know how and to sell products and services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been completed  the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
multiple element arrangements 
some of our revenue arrangements include multiple elements mes  such as hardware  software  maintenance and other services 
we evaluate each element in a multiple element arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
an element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and delivery of an undelivered element is both probable and within our control 
when these criteria are not met  the delivered and undelivered elements are combined and the arrangement fees are allocated to this combined single unit 
if the unit separation criteria are met  we account for each element within a me arrangement such as hardware  software  maintenance and other services separately  whereby the total arrangement fees are allocated to each element based on its relative selling price  which we establish using a selling price hierarchy 
we determine the selling price of each element based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
for some arrangements  customers receive certain elements over a period of time  after delivery of the initial product 
these elements may include support and maintenance and or the right to receive upgrades 
revenue allocated to the undelivered element is recognized either over its estimated service period or when the upgrade is delivered 
we do not recognize revenue that is contingent upon the future delivery of products or services or upon future performance obligations 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we have completed all contractual obligations 
we determine our esp for an individual element within a me revenue arrangement using the same methods used to determine the selling price of an element sold on a standalone basis 
if we sell the element on a standalone basis  we estimate the selling price by considering actual sales prices 
otherwise  we estimate the selling price by considering internal factors such as pricing practices and margin objectives 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing 
we account for the majority of our digital cinema server and processor sales as me arrangements that may include up to four separate units  or elements  of accounting 
the first element consists of our digital cinema server hardware and the accompanying software  which is essential to the functionality of the hardware 
this element is typically delivered at the time of sale 
the second element is the right to receive support and maintenance  which is included with the purchase of the hardware element and is typically delivered over a service period subsequent to the initial sale 
the third element is the right to receive specified upgrades  which is included with the purchase of the hardware element and is typically delivered when a specified upgrade is available  subsequent to the initial sale 
under revenue recognition accounting standards  sales of our digital cinema servers typically result in the allocation of a substantial majority of the arrangement fees to the delivered hardware element based on its esp  which we recognize as revenue at the time of sale once delivery has occurred 
a small portion of the arrangement fees are allocated to the undelivered support and maintenance element  and in some cases to the undelivered specified upgrade element  based on the vsoe or esp of each element 
the portion of the arrangement fees allocated to the support and maintenance element are recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated service period  and the portion of the arrangement fees allocated to specified upgrades are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the upgrade 
the fourth element is the right to receive commissioning services performed solely in connection with our digital servers necessary for the installation of dolby atmos enabled theatres 
these services consist of the review of venue designs specifying proposed speaker placement  as well as calibration services performed for installed speakers to ensure optimal playback 
a small portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to these services based on their esp which we recognize as revenue once the services have been completed 
software arrangements 
revenue recognition for transactions that involve software  such as fees we earn from certain system licensees  may include multiple elements 
for some of our me arrangements  customers receive certain elements over a period of time or after delivery of the initial software 
these elements may include support and maintenance 
the fair values of these elements are recognized over the estimated period for which these elements will be delivered  which is sometimes the estimated life of the software 
if we do not have vsoe of fair value for any undelivered element included in these me arrangements for software  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and or services have been performed  or until we have vsoe of fair value for all remaining undelivered elements 
if the undelivered element is support and we do not have fair value for the support element  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
in certain cases  our arrangements require the licensee to pay a fixed fee for units they may distribute in the future 
these fees are generally recognized upon contract execution  unless the arrangement includes contingency terms or is considered a me arrangement 
judgments and uncertainties revenue recognition for transactions that may include multiple elements  such as fees we earn from certain system licensees  requires judgment in several possible areas including the following identifying the significant deliverables within the arrangements and determining whether the significant deliverables constitute separate units of accounting  timing of delivery or performance of service for the significant deliverables  the assumptions and inputs used to determine selling price whether vendor specific objective evidence  third party evidence  or estimated selling price for the significant deliverables  to the extent that customers receive certain elements of the arrangement over a period of time following initial delivery  as necessary  we estimate the period of time over which revenue is recognized  and whether collectibility is probable 
we determine collectibility based on an evaluation of our customer recent payment history  the existence of a standby letter of credit between the customer financial institution and our financial institution  and other factors 

table of contents income taxes description we use the asset and liability method  under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed 
our policy is to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position is sustainable upon examination by tax authorities 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is additionally dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists 
we include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes 
to the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued are reduced in the period that such determination is made and are reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision 
judgments and uncertainties we make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this includes estimating actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  including the timing of the recognition of stock based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax asset and liability balances  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and the reserve resulting from uncertainties in income tax positions 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially affected if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or if the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
investments description valuation 
our investments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we evaluate our investment portfolio for credit losses and other than temporary impairments by comparing the fair value with the cost basis for each of our investment securities 
an investment is impaired if the fair value is less than its cost basis 
if any portion of the impairment is deemed to be the result of a credit loss  the credit loss portion of the impairment is included as a component of net income 
if we deem it probable that we will not recover the full cost basis of the security  the security is other than temporarily impaired and the impairment loss is recognized as a component of net income 
the degree to which estimates and judgment are used in determining fair value is generally dependent upon the market pricing information available for the investments  the availability of observable inputs and input from independent third parties  the frequency of trading in the investments  and the investment s complexity 
if different judgments regarding inputs were made  we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments 
classification 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale securities  with the exception of our investments held in our supplemental retirement plan  which are classified as trading securities 
investments that have an original maturity of days or more at the date of purchase and a current maturity of less than one year are classified as short term investments  while investments with a current maturity of more than one year are classified as long term investments 
we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value using a three level hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investment that are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity  such as market quoted prices 
judgments and uncertainties the degree to which estimates and judgment are used in determining fair value  is generally dependent upon the market pricing information available for the investments  the availability of observable inputs  the frequency of trading in the investments and the investment s complexity 
if different judgments regarding inputs were made  we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments 
gaap establishes a three level hierarchy prioritizing the observable inputs used in measuring the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as follows the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets that are accessible by us at the measurement date for identical investments  described as level  and the lowest priority to valuation techniques using unobservable inputs  described as level we obtain the fair value of our level financial instruments from a professional pricing service  which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments 
fair value from this professional pricing source can also be based on pricing models whereby all significant inputs  including maturity dates  issue dates  settlement dates  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids  offers and other market related data  are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset 

table of contents stock based compensation description we determine the expense for all employee stock based compensation awards by estimating their fair value and recognizing that value as an expense  on a ratable basis  in our consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period in which our employees earn the awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of the grant 
judgments and uncertainties to determine the fair value of a stock based award using the black scholes option pricing model  we make assumptions regarding the expected term of the award  the expected future volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate over the expected term of the award 
we estimate the expected term of our stock based awards by evaluating historical exercise patterns of our employees 
we use a blend of the historical volatility of our common stock and the implied volatility of our traded options as an estimate of the expected volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the awards 
we use an average interest rate based on us treasury instruments with terms consistent with the expected term of our awards to estimate the risk free interest rate 
we reduce the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of the grant and revise our estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimate 
results of operations revenue and gross margin licensing we license intellectual property to our customers that may be internally developed  acquired by us  or licensed from third parties 
our cost of licensing consists mainly of amortization of purchased intangible assets and intangible assets acquired in business combinations as well as third party royalty obligations paid to license intellectual property that we then sublicense to our customers

capital expenditures and uses of capital our capital expenditures consist of purchases of land  building  building fixtures  office equipment  computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements  and production and test equipment 
we continue to invest in sales and marketing and research and development that contribute to the overall growth of our business and technological innovation 
in fiscal  we purchased an approximately  square foot property in san francisco  california for million  using existing cash 
we are in the process of making substantial improvements to the property in order to prepare the building for its intended use as our new worldwide headquarters

based on the  shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding as of the record date  the total special dividend payment was million 
to fund the dividend payment  we used existing cash along with proceeds from the sale of securities from our investment portfolio 
we retain sufficient cash holdings to support our operations and we also purchase investment grade securities diversified among security types  industries  and issuers 
we have used cash generated from our operations to fund a variety of activities related to our business in addition to our ongoing operations  including business expansion and growth  acquisitions  and repurchases of our common stock 
we have historically generated significant cash from operations  however these cash flows and the value of our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  as described in part ii  item a risk factors

due to their varying terms and conditions  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount we could be required to pay 
cash flows factors identified below reflect their order of magnitude in descending order 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million from fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following factor impact on cash flows net income a decrease in net income changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased resulting from increases in current assets exceeding decreases in current liabilities largely due to an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to timing differences investing activities net cash provided by used in investing activities increased million from fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following factor impact on cash flows sale of marketable securities an increase in proceeds received from the sale of available for sale securities as these securities were sold in part to fund the payment of a million special dividend made in the first quarter of fiscal capital expenditures increased as less capital expenditures were made in fiscal compared to fiscal when the building to be used as our new headquarters was acquired purchases of marketable securities increased as we purchased less available for sale securities in fiscal following the payment of a million special dividend made in the first quarter of fiscal proceeds from maturities of securities decreased due to a lower volume of proceeds from maturities financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following factor impact on cash flows dividend due to the payment of a special dividend to holders of our class a and class b common stock share repurchases fewer share repurchases of our class a common stock in fiscal compared to fiscal distributions due to an increase in distributions made to our controlling interest in fiscal off balance sheet and contractual obligations our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  and we have not entered into any arrangements that are expected to have a material affect on liquidity or the availability of capital resources

the term of the agreement is years  over which we will make payments on a semi annual basis 
our payment obligations are conditioned in part on the academy awards being held and broadcast from the dolby theatre

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity cash  cash equivalents and investments as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted of cash and highly liquid money market funds 
in addition  we had short term and long term investments of million  which consisted primarily of municipal debt securities  corporate bonds  and us agency securities 
our investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and on supporting our liquidity requirements 
we do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
our holdings of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  the majority of which are managed by external managers  meet the guidelines of our investment policy 
we invest in highly rated securities with a minimum credit rating of a and our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the us government 
at september   our weighted average portfolio credit quality was aa and the weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio was approximately fourteen months 
the investments within our fixed income portfolio are subject to fluctuations in interest rates  which could affect our financial position  and to a lesser extent  results of operations 
based on our investment portfolio balance as of september   hypothetical changes in interest rates of and would have an impact on the carrying value of our portfolio of approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange risk we maintain business operations in foreign countries  most significantly in the united kingdom  australia  china  germany and the netherlands 
we also conduct a growing portion of our business outside of the us through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound  australian dollar  chinese yuan renminbi  indian rupee  japanese yen  korean won and euro 
as a result  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
the majority of our revenue generated from international markets is denominated in us dollars  while the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currencies 
therefore  our operating expenses will increase when the us dollar weakens against the local currency and decrease when the us dollar strengthens against the local currency 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
our foreign operations are subject to the same risks present when conducting business internationally  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions 
in an effort to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against assets and liabilities for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
these derivative instruments are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
while not designated 
table of contents as hedging instruments  these foreign currency forward contracts are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables 
these contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the related receivables and payables for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
as of september  and september   the outstanding derivative instruments had maturities of days or less and the total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were million and million  respectively 
the fair values of these contracts were nominal as of september  and september   and were included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
for additional information related to our foreign currency forward contracts  see note fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign currency forward contracts as of september  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for these forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar would lead to a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these financial instruments by million
