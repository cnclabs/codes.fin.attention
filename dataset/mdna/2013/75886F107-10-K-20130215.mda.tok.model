item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers  invents  develops  manufactures  and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
our total revenues were  million in  compared to million in and million in in  we earned a million substantive milestone payment from sanofi upon fda approval of zaltrap  as well as million and million substantive milestone payments from bayer healthcare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approval  respectively  in japan for eylea for the treatment of wet amd 
our net income was million  or per diluted share  in  compared to net losses of million  or per share basic and diluted  in and million  or per share basic and diluted  in net income in included an income tax benefit of million primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  as described below under results of operations 
we currently have three marketed products eylea aflibercept injection  which is available in the united states for the treatment of wet amd and macular edema following crvo  and in the united kingdom  germany  switzerland  australia  japan  and certain other countries for the treatment of wet amd 
we commenced sales of eylea for the treatment of wet amd in november and the treatment of macular edema following crvo in september  following receipt of regulatory approval in the united states 
bayer healthcare commenced sales of eylea for the treatment of wet amd in the fourth quarter of following receipt of regulatory approvals in the european union and other regions 
bayer healthcare has additional regulatory applications for eylea for the treatment of wet amd pending in other countries 
in addition  bayer healthcare submitted applications for marketing authorization for eylea in europe in december and in japan in january for the treatment of macular edema following crvo 
we are collaborating with bayer healthcare on the global development and commercialization of eylea outside the united states 
bayer healthcare will market eylea outside the united states  where  for countries other than japan  the companies will share equally the profits and losses from sales of eylea 
in japan  we are entitled to a royalty on sales of eylea  as described below 
we maintain exclusive rights to eylea in the united states and are entitled to all profits from any such sales 
net product sales of eylea in the united states were million in and million in eylea net product sales outside of the united states  which are recorded by bayer healthcare  commenced in the fourth quarter of  and were million for the year 
zaltrap ziv aflibercept injection for intravenous infusion  which is available in the united states for treatment  in combination with folfiri  of patients with mcrc that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin containing regimen 
in february  the ec granted marketing authorization in the european union for zaltrap mg ml concentrate for solution for infusion in combination with folriri chemotherapy in adults with mcrc that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin containing regimen 
regulatory applications for marketing authorization of zaltrap for the treatment of previously treated mcrc patients in other countries have also been submitted and are currently under review by the respective regulatory agencies 
we and sanofi globally collaborate on the development and commercialization of zaltrap  and share profits and losses from commercialization of zaltrap  except for japan  where we are entitled to a royalty on sales of zaltrap  as described below 
zaltrap net product sales  which are recorded by sanofi  commenced in the united states in august and totaled million in arcalyst rilonacept injection for subcutaneous use  which is available in the united states for the treatment of caps  including fcas and mws  in adults and children and older 
caps are a group of rare  inherited  auto inflammatory conditions characterized by life long  recurrent symptoms of rash  fever chills  joint pain  eye redness pain  and fatigue 
net product sales of arcalyst totaled million in  million in and million in net product sales of arcalyst in included million of arcalyst net product sales made in and 
table of contents million of previously deferred net product sales  as described below under item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
we do not expect future net product sales of arcalyst for the treatment of caps to be significant 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
before significant revenues from the commercialization of our antibody candidates or new indications for our marketed products can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
beginning in the first quarter of  we reported profitability  prior to that  we generally incurred net losses 
our ability to continue to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on our success in commercializing eylea 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities  a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators 
also  our research and development activities outside our collaborations  the costs of which are not reimbursed  will expand and require additional resources 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on  among other factors  the net sales of our marketed products  the scope and progress of our research and development efforts  the timing of certain expenses  and the continuation of our collaborations with sanofi and bayer healthcare  including our share of collaboration profits or losses  or royalties  from sales of commercialized products and the amount of reimbursement of our research and development expenses that we receive from collaborators 
we cannot predict whether or when new products or new indications for our marketed products will receive regulatory approval or  if any such approval is received  whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product s and whether or when they may become profitable 
we have product candidates in clinical development  all of which were discovered in our research laboratories 
our trap based clinical programs are eylea  which is in clinical trials for the treatment of dme and macular edema following brvo  and  in asia  mcnv  in collaboration with bayer healthcare  and zaltrap  which is being studied in combination with our angiopoietin inhibitor regn in oncology in collaboration with sanofi 
our antibody based clinical programs include eleven fully human monoclonal antibodies 
the following six are being developed in collaboration with sanofi sarilumab regn  an antibody to the interleukin receptor il r  which is being developed in rheumatoid arthritis  regn  an antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type pcsk  which is being developed for ldl cholesterol reduction  regn  an antibody to the interleukin receptor il r  which is being developed in atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma  regn  an antibody to delta like ligand dll  a novel angiogenesis target  which is being developed in oncology  regn  an antibody to angiopoietin ang  another novel angiogenesis target  which is being developed in oncology  and regn  an antibody to myostatin gdf  which is in clinical development 
in addition  we are developing the following five antibodies independently regn  an antibody to erbb  which is being developed in oncology  regn  an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target  which is being developed in atopic dermatitis  regn  an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target  regn  an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target  and regn  an antibody to nerve growth factor ngf  which is being developed for the treatment of pain and which is currently on clinical hold by the fda

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires an assumption or assumptions regarding a future outcome  and changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
the critical accounting estimates that impact our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition product revenue product sales consist of us sales of eylea and arcalyst 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured  we have no further performance obligations  and returns can be reasonably estimated 
we record revenue from product sales upon delivery to our distributors and specialty pharmacies collectively  our customers 
we sell eylea in the united states to three distributors and several specialty pharmacies 
we sell arcalyst in the united states to two specialty pharmacies 
under these distribution models  the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally take physical delivery of product 
for eylea  the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally sell the product directly to healthcare providers  whereas for arcalyst  the specialty pharmacies sell the product directly to patients 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded and  respectively  of our total gross product revenue from sales to besse medical  a subsidiary of amerisourcebergen corporation 
revenue from product sales is recorded net of applicable provisions for rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs including medicaid  distribution related fees  prompt pay discounts  product returns  and other sales related deductions 
calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgments 
we review our estimates of rebates  chargebacks  and other applicable provisions each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period net product sales 
the following table summarizes the provisions  and credits payments  for government rebates and chargebacks  distribution related fees  and other sales related deductions  such amounts were not significant during the year ended december  in millions rebates chargebacks distribution related fees other sales related deductions total balance as of december  provision related to current period sales credits payments balance as of december  government rebates and chargebacks we estimate reductions to product sales for medicaid and veterans administration va programs  and for certain other qualifying federal and state government programs 
based upon our contracts with government agencies  statutorily defined discounts applicable to government funded programs  historical experience  and  in the case of eylea  estimated payer mix based on third party market research data  we estimate and record an allowance for rebates and chargebacks 
our liability for medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make for a current quarter  claims for prior quarters that have been estimated for which an invoice has not been received  and invoices received for claims from prior 
table of contents quarters that have not been paid 
our reserves related to discounted pricing offered to va  public health services phs  and other institutions collectively  qualified healthcare providers represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices we charge to our customers 
our customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers 
our reserve for this discounted pricing is based on expected sales to qualified healthcare providers and the chargebacks that customers have already claimed 
distribution related fees we have written contracts with our customers that include terms for distribution related fees 
we estimate and record distribution and related fees due to our customers based on gross sales 
prompt pay discounts no prompt pay discounts are currently offered to our customers on sales of eylea 
in connection with sales of arcalyst  we offer discounts to our customers for prompt payments 
we estimate these discounts based on customer terms and historical experience  and expect that our customers will always take advantage of this discount 
therefore  we accrue of the prompt pay discount that is based on the gross amount of each arcalyst invoice at the time of sale 
product returns consistent with industry practice  we offer our customers a limited right to return product purchased directly from us  which is principally based upon the product expiration date 
we will accept returns for three months prior to and up to six months after the product expiration date 
product returned is generally not resalable given the nature of our products and method of administration 
we develop estimates for product returns based upon historical experience  inventory levels in the distribution channel  shelf life of the product  and other relevant factors 
we monitor product supply levels in the distribution channel  as well as sales by our customers of eylea to healthcare providers and arcalyst to patients using product specific data provided by our customers 
if necessary  our estimates of product returns may be adjusted in the future based on actual returns experience  known or expected changes in the marketplace  or other factors 
collaboration revenue we earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms 
we currently have collaboration agreements with sanofi and bayer healthcare 
the terms of these collaboration agreements typically include non refundable up front licensing payments  research progress milestone payments  payments for development activities  and sharing of profits or losses arising from the commercialization of products 
non refundable up front license payments  where continuing involvement is required of us  are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement  and adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based on the applicable facts and circumstances 
although we did not enter into  or materially modify  any collaboration arrangements with multiple deliverables in or  any future arrangements with multiple deliverables will be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered item or items has value to the collaborator on a standalone basis 
payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone  involving a degree of risk  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non refundable  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related product candidate  such as completion of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies  and receipt of approvals by regulatory agencies 
in determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone  we take into consideration i enhancement in value to the related development product candidate  ii our performance and the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone  iii whether the milestone relates solely to past performance  and iv whether the milestone payment is considered reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms 
payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we enter into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities 
we may share the costs of research and development activities with our collaborator  such as in our eylea collaboration with bayer healthcare  or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of our research and development activities  such as in our zaltrap and antibody collaborations with sanofi 
we record our internal and third party development costs associated with these collaborations as research and development expenses 
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration  we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses 
if the collaboration is a cost sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs  in periods when our collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the collaboration and regeneron  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of the collaborator development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
under our collaboration agreements  we share in any profits or losses arising from the commercialization of products 
our collaborator provides us with our estimated share of the profits or losses  based on net product sales less cost of goods sold and 
table of contents shared commercialization and other expenses  from commercialization of such products for the most recent fiscal quarter 
our share of the profit or loss is recorded as collaboration revenue 
our collaborators estimates of net products sales and related expenses for such quarter are reconciled to their actual net product sales and related expenses in the subsequent fiscal quarter  and our share of the profit or loss is adjusted accordingly  as necessary 
in connection with non refundable licensing payments  our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope  progress  and results of our research and development activities 
due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product  changes to development plans as programs progress  and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically  and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future 
in addition  our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications 
also  if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we would recognize as revenue any unamortized remainder of an up front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities  utilizing external entities such as cros  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately  while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or cros are expected to provide services 
clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by cros 
cros typically perform most of the start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training  and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these start up costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range can be significantly wider  as many of our contracts with cros are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget  while start up costs for the particular trial may not change materially 
these start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and or penalties 
for clinical study sites  where payments are made periodically on a per patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue expenses on an estimated cost per patient basis  based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter 
the amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study  the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter  the required level of patient enrollment  the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop out of the clinical study  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements  and span multiple years 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results  which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known 
no material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended december    or stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock under our long term incentive plans to employees and non employee members of our board of directors based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the grant date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award requisite service period 
we use the black scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility has been estimated based on actual 
table of contents movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors option grants 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation expense also includes an estimate  which is made at the time of grant  of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited 
this estimate is revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock based compensation recognized in future periods 
in addition  we have granted performance based stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements 
potential compensation cost  measured on the grant date  related to these performance options will be recognized only if  and when  we estimate that these options will vest  which is based on whether we consider the options performance conditions to be probable of attainment 
our estimates of the number of performance based options that will vest will be revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods 
changes in these estimates may materially affect the amount of stock based compensation that we recognize in future periods related to performance based options 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts temporary differences at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we periodically re assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on various factors including our historical earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  and forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate  a tax benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of such reversal 
prior to  we recorded a valuation allowance that fully offset our net deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  based on our evaluation of various factors  including our achievement of a cumulative three year income position as of december   we released substantially all of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and recorded a corresponding income tax benefit as described in results of operations below 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  which prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
those positions  for which management assessment is that there is more than a probability of sustaining the position upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits  are subjected to certain measurement criteria 
marketable securities we have invested our excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  other debt securities guaranteed by the us government  and money market funds that invest in us government securities 
we consider our marketable securities to be available for sale  as defined by authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
these assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
if the decline in the value of a marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other than temporary  we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss that may be charged against income 
we review our portfolio of marketable securities  using both quantitative and qualitative factors  to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other than temporary 
such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  recommendations of investment advisors  and forecasts of economic  market  or industry trends 
with respect to debt securities  this review process also includes an evaluation of our intent to sell an individual debt security or our need to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or maturity 
with respect to equity securities  this review process includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold the securities until their full value can be recovered 
this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment 
we recorded no charges for other than temporary impairment of our marketable securities during and  and an inconsequential charge for other than temporary impairment of our marketable securities during 
table of contents inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when  based on management judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized  otherwise  such costs are expensed as research and development 
we periodically analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value  and write down such inventories as appropriate 
in addition  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
if certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration  we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down such unmarketable inventory to its estimated realizable value 
in and  cost of goods sold included inventory write downs and reserves totaling million and million  respectively 
in  there were no inventory write downs or reserves included in cost of goods sold 
results of operations years ended december  and net income loss we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  for our net income in resulted primarily from net product sales of eylea  which we launched in november  and an income tax benefit of million  primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in  we also earned a million substantive milestone payment from sanofi upon fda approval of zaltrap and million of substantive milestone payments from bayer healthcare upon receipt of marketing and pricing approvals in japan for eylea for the treatment of wet amd 
revenues revenues in and consist of the following in millions net product sales collaboration revenue sanofi bayer healthcare total collaboration revenue technology licensing revenue contract research and other revenue total revenue net product sales net product sales consist of us sales of eylea and arcalyst 
we record product sales net of allowances and accruals for prompt pay discounts  rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs including medicaid  product returns  and distribution related fees 
in november  we received marketing approval from the fda for eylea for the treatment of wet amd  at which time product sales commenced 
in addition  in september  we received marketing approval from the fda for eylea for the treatment of macular edema following crvo 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of eylea net product sales 
in and  we also recognized arcalyst net product sales of million and million  respectively

bayer healthcare provides us with estimated eylea development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter 
bayer healthcare s estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of its eylea development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly 
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount and non cash compensation expense  as described above 
clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs for clinical studies of our antibody candidates  especially regn and regn  and higher costs related to our phase studies of eylea in dme and macular edema following brvo  partly offset by lower costs related to our phase view trial of eylea in wet amd  which has concluded 
clinical manufacturing costs increased primarily due to higher costs related to manufacturing regn  certain other antibody candidates  and clinical supplies of eylea  partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of arcalyst 
occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount  expanded research and development activities  and higher information technology and facility related costs 
cost sharing of bayer healthcare eylea development expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs in connection with bayer healthcare wet amd development activities  including the view trial  which has concluded 

table of contents we prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development  which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor  non cash compensation expense  and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects  and  under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  the portion of bayer healthcare eylea development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below project costs year ended december  increase in millions decrease eylea arcalyst zaltrap regn sarilumab regn other antibody candidates in clinical development other research programs and unallocated costs total research and development expenses drug development and approval in the united states is a multi step process regulated by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation  leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda which  if successful  allows the opportunity for study in humans  or clinical study  of the potential new drug 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phases   and the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase clinical trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process 
following successful completion of phase clinical trials for a biological product  a bla must be submitted to  and accepted by  the fda  and the fda must approve the bla prior to commercialization of the drug 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of a bla  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
we may elect either on our own  or at the request of the fda  to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase b and studies 
phase b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the bla is under fda review 
these studies are conducted under an ind 
phase studies  also referred to as post marketing studies  are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing 
in addition  as discovery research  preclinical development  and clinical programs progress  opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge 
we may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs  thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product 
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development  including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development  uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials  changes in regulatory requirements  changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate  and other risks and uncertainties described in part ii  item a  risk factors 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
for these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied  the estimated cost and scope of the projects  and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
similarly  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates or additional indications for our marketed products in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due to higher selling expenses in connection with commercialization of eylea  higher headcount  and higher non cash compensation expense principally for the reason described above

we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down our inventory to its estimated realizable value if certain batches or units of product do not meet quality specifications or are expected to expire prior to sale 
other income and expense investment income decreased to million in from million in due primarily to lower yields on cash and marketable securities 
interest expense increased to million in from million in in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
total interest expense in and associated with these notes  including amortization of the note discount and debt issuance costs  was million and million  respectively 
income taxes in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million income tax benefit  primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the decision to release this valuation allowance was made after we determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized  and was based on the evaluation and weighting of positive and negative evidence  including our achievement of a cumulative three year income position in the fourth quarter of in addition  we considered forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration 
due to our release of this valuation allowance in  starting in we will record income taxes on our pre tax income we recognize using an estimated effective tax rate  which is expected to approximate statutory tax rates 
in  we recorded a million income tax benefit  which consisted primarily of million related to tax legislation that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre research tax credits 
years ended december  and net loss we reported a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted for the increase in our net loss in was principally due to higher selling  general  and administrative expenses  partly in connection with commercializing eylea for wet amd  and higher research and development expenses

arcalyst for the treatment of caps was our first commercialized drug product 
arcalyst net product sales in included million of arcalyst net product sales made in and million of previously deferred net product sales 
we had limited historical returns experience for arcalyst beginning with initial sales in through the end of  therefore  arcalyst net product sales were deferred until the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated 
effective in the first quarter of  we determined that we had accumulated sufficient historical data to reasonably estimate both product returns and rebates of arcalyst  and  as a result  million of previously deferred arcalyst net product sales were recognized as revenue in the first quarter of the effect of recognizing the previously deferred arcalyst net product sales revenue was to lower our net loss per share by in at december  and  there was no deferred revenue related to net product sales

our share of these expenses was million in  which reduced our sanofi collaboration revenue 
in  sanofi reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of million under the discovery agreement and million of development costs under the license agreement  compared to million and million  respectively  
table of contents in the higher reimbursement amount under the discovery agreement in compared to was primarily due to an increase in our antibody discovery activities 
the slightly lower reimbursement of development costs in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in development activities related to regn  which is currently on clinical hold  offset generally by increases in development activities for other antibody candidates 
recognition of deferred revenue related to sanofi million up front payment and other payments increased in compared to in connection with the november amendment of the discovery agreement  sanofi committed to fund up to million of agreed upon costs incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer  new york facilities  of which million was received or receivable as of december  revenue related to such funding from sanofi is deferred and recognized as collaboration revenue prospectively over the related performance period in conjunction with the recognition of the original million up front payment

collaborations with sanofi zaltrap aflibercept in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals inc predecessor to sanofi us to collaborate on the development and commercialization of zaltrap in all countries other than japan  where we retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize zaltrap 
sanofi made a non refundable up front payment of million and purchased  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for million 
in january  we and sanofi amended the collaboration agreement to exclude  from the scope of the collaboration  the development and commercialization of zaltrap for intraocular delivery to the eye 
in connection with this amendment  sanofi made a million non refundable payment to us 
in december  we and sanofi amended our collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the development of zaltrap to include japan 
in connection with this amendment  sanofi agreed to make a million non refundable up front payment to us  which was received in january in august  the fda approved zaltrap injection for intravenous infusion  in combination with folfiri  for patients with mcrc that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin containing regimen  and sanofi commenced zaltrap sales in the united states 
we received  and recorded as revenue in  a million substantive milestone payment from sanofi upon fda approval of zaltrap 
we currently manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of zaltrap 
in the future  sanofi is expected to be responsible for manufacturing commercial supplies of zaltrap 
under the collaboration agreement  as amended  we and sanofi share co promotion rights and profits and losses on sales of zaltrap outside of japan for disease indications included in our collaboration 
in japan  we are entitled to a royalty of approximately on annual sales of zaltrap  subject to certain potential adjustments 

table of contents under the collaboration agreement  as amended  agreed upon worldwide zaltrap development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement  including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical drug supplies  are funded by sanofi 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi for of these development expenses in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and japan royalties  or at a faster rate at our option 
in addition  if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi for of the million payment received in connection with the january amendment to our collaboration agreement 
as a result  we expect that  initially  our share of any zaltrap profits including royalties on sales of zaltrap in japan will be used to reimburse sanofi for this repayment obligation 
in particular  our contingent reimbursement obligation to sanofi for zaltrap was approximately million as of december  sanofi funded million  million  and million  respectively  of our zaltrap development and other costs in   and our share of the loss from commercialization of zaltrap  representing our share of zaltrap net product sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses  was million in and million in  respectively 
at december  and  there was a net payable of million and million to sanofi in connection with the companies zaltrap collaboration 
in addition  the up front payments from sanofi of million in september and million in january were recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized as contract research and development revenue over the period during which we expect to perform services 
in   and  we recognized million  million and million per year of revenue  respectively  related to these up front payments 
sanofi has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice 
upon termination of the agreement for any reason  any remaining obligation to reimburse sanofi for of zaltrap development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to zaltrap 
antibodies in november  we and sanofi entered into a global  strategic collaboration to discover  develop  and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies 
the collaboration is governed by a discovery and preclinical development agreement and a license and collaboration agreement 
in connection with the execution of the discovery agreement in  we received a non refundable up front payment of million from sanofi 
pursuant to the collaboration  sanofi is funding our research to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets 
in november  we and sanofi amended these collaboration agreements to expand and extend our antibody collaboration 
under the amended discovery agreement  sanofi agreed to fund up to million per year of our antibody discovery activities in through  subject to a one time option for sanofi to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to million per year commencing in if over the prior two years certain specified criteria were not satisfied 
in  as we scaled up our capacity to conduct antibody discovery activities  sanofi funded million of our preclinical research under the amended discovery agreement 
the balance between that amount and million  or million  was added to the funding otherwise available to us in under the amended discovery agreement 
the amended discovery agreement will expire on december   however  sanofi has an option to extend the agreement for up to an additional three years for further antibody development and preclinical activities 
for each drug candidate identified through discovery research under the discovery agreement  sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement 
if it elects to do so  sanofi will co develop the drug candidate with us through product approval 
under certain defined circumstances  upon exercising its option to license rights to particular candidates  sanofi must make a million substantive milestone payment to us 
under the license agreement  agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement are funded by sanofi  except that following receipt of the first positive phase trial results for a co developed drug candidate  subsequent phase trial related costs for that drug candidate called shared phase trial costs are shared by sanofi and by us 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi for of development expenses that were fully funded by sanofi and of shared phase trial costs  in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these expenses and our share of the collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration products

in connection with the lease  we have issued a million letter of credit to our landlord  which is fully collateralized by cash and marketable securities 
certain premises under the lease are accounted for as operating leases 
however  for buildings a  b  and c that we are leasing  we are deemed  in substance  to be the owner of the landlord buildings in accordance with the application of fasb authoritative guidance

the notes were offered by the initial purchaser only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the notes pay interest semi annually on april and october  and will mature on october   unless earlier converted or repurchased 
the notes will be convertible  subject to certain conditions  into cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock  at our option 
the initial conversion rate for the notes will be shares of common stock subject to adjustment in certain circumstances per  principal amount of the notes  or a total of approximately  shares upon conversion  which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
a holder of the notes may surrender their notes at their option any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july   only under the following circumstances i during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on december  and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day  ii during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price  as defined  of the notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day  iii if we elect to issue to all or substantially all holders of our common stock any rights  options  or warrants other than pursuant to a rights plan entitling them for a period of not more than calendar days after the record date for such issuance  to subscribe for or purchase shares of our common stock  at a price per share less than the average of the last reported sales prices of our common stock for the ten consecutive day period ending on  and including  the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date for such issuance  iv upon specified distributions to our shareholders  or v upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  such as a fundamental change ie  a change in control  or our common stock ceasing to be listed on at least one us national securities exchange

based on the reported sales prices of our common stock  the notes were able to be converted by holders as of december  in connection with the offering of the convertible senior notes  we entered into convertible note hedge call option and warrant transactions with multiple counterparties  including an affiliate of the initial purchaser 
the convertible note hedge transactions cover  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the notes  and are intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the conversion feature of the notes

table of contents funding requirements we expect continued growth in our expenditures  particularly in connection with our research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing  commercialization of eylea and zaltrap  and capital expenditures 
we believe that our existing capital resources  funds generated by anticipated eylea net product sales  and funding for reimbursement of development costs that we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements will enable us to meet our projected operating needs for the foreseeable future 
as described above  research and development expenses that we incur in connection with our zaltrap and antibodies collaborations are generally funded by sanofi 
in addition  as described above  we and bayer healthcare share agreed upon development expenses that both companies incur in connection with our eylea collaboration 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  these obligations and commitments assume non termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change payments due by period in millions total less than one year to years to years greater than years convertible senior notes operating leases capital leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations consists of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature on october   unless earlier converted or repurchased 
the amounts in the table above assume the payment of interest on our convertible senior notes through their maturity date and the payment of the principal amount of the notes at their maturity date 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually 
the convertible senior notes will be convertible  subject to certain conditions  into cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock  at our option 
as of december   the convertible senior notes were convertible under the terms of the notes 
excludes future contingent costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
see note a to our consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations primarily relate to i research and development commitments  including those related to clinical trials  ii capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions  and iii license payments 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events 
open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above 
represents payments with respect to facility lease obligations in connection with our lease of facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above 
see note a to our consolidated financial statements 
under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  over the next several years we and bayer healthcare will share agreed upon eylea development expenses incurred by both companies  under a global development plan  as described above 
in addition  under our collaboration agreements with sanofi and bayer healthcare  we and our collaborator will share profits and losses in connection with commercialization of drug products 
profits or losses under each collaboration are measured by calculating net sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses 
if the applicable collaboration becomes profitable  we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi and bayer healthcare for a defined percentage generally of agreed upon development expenses incurred by sanofi and bayer healthcare  respectively 
these reimbursements would be deducted from our share of the collaboration profits and  for our zaltrap collaboration with sanofi and our bayer healthcare collaboration  royalties on product sales in japan otherwise payable to us  unless  in some cases  we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate 
in particular  as of december   our reimbursement obligation to sanofi for zaltrap was approximately million  while our reimbursement obligation to bayer healthcare for eylea was approximately million 
therefore  we expect that  initially  our share of profits from sales of zaltrap  and a portion of our share of profits from sales of eylea outside the united states  will be used to reimburse our collaborators for these obligations 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including revenues from net product sales  the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products  and the timing thereof  the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights and pending 
table of contents or future litigation related thereto  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of our collaborations with sanofi and bayer healthcare 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  and for supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
our commercialization costs over the next few years will depend on  among other things  whether or not new indications for our marketed products or our antibody product candidates in later stage clinical development receive regulatory approval  the market potential for such new indications or product candidates  and the commercialization terms of our collaboration agreements  if applicable whereby some or all commercialization costs may be shared with our collaborators 
currently  we are required to pay royalties on sales of our commercial products 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell eylea for other indications  or certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay additional royalties or share the profits from such sales pursuant to our license or collaboration agreements 
as described above  in   and  we made cash payments of million  million  and million  respectively  for employee tax obligations in connection with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock 
future cash requirements for such payments will depend on various factors  including the level of stock option grants and exercises and the sales prices of our common stock  and may continue to be substantial 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will continue to be substantial 
due to the amounts of our net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available for tax purposes  which totaled million and million  respectively  at december   we do not anticipate incurring substantive cash obligations for federal and state corporate income taxes in the near future 
in connection with our collaboration with bayer healthcare  we are entitled to receive milestone payments related to marketing and pricing approvals of eylea in major market countries outside the united states  as well as sales milestones based on total annual sales of eylea outside the united states achieving certain specified levels 
under the terms of our zaltrap collaboration agreement with sanofi  we are also entitled to receive milestone payments upon receipt of additional specified marketing approvals 
other than letters of credits totaling million as of december   including a million letter of credit issued in connection with our lease for facilities in tarrytown  new york  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no other established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in october  we completed a private placement of convertible senior notes 
in addition  in october  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registering the sale  in one or more offerings  of an indeterminate amount of equity or debt securities  together or separately  and our october public offering of approximately million shares of common stock was completed under this shelf registration statement 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to complete any additional offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development and commercialization  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure additional funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we require additional funding  and cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could materially harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates  principally in connection with our investments in marketable securities  which consist primarily of direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  and other debt securities guaranteed by the us government 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimate that a basis point  or  unfavorable change in interest rates would have resulted in approximately a million and million decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest rate risk year over year is due primarily to higher balances of marketable debt securities that we held at december  compared to the same period of

nonetheless  deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security 
during   and  other than temporary impairment charges recognized by us  if any  were inconsequential 
we are also subject to credit risk in connection with accounts receivable from our product sales of eylea and arcalyst 
these accounts receivable are due from three distributors and several specialty pharmacies  who are our customers 
we have contractual payment terms with each of our customers  and we monitor our customers financial performance and credit worthiness so that we can properly assess and respond to any changes in their credit profile 
in addition  we may insure a portion of our accounts receivables within our overall risk management practices 
during   and  we did not recognize any charges for write offs of accounts receivable related to our marketed products 
at december  and  one individual customer accounted for and  respectively  of our net trade accounts receivable balances
