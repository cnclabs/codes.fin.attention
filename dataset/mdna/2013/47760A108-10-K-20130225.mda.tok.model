item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors or in other parts of this form k 
overview we provide a social business platform that improves business results by enabling a more productive and effective workforce through enhanced communications and collaboration both inside and outside the enterprise 
organizations deploy our platform to improve employee productivity  enhance revenue opportunities  lower operational costs  increase customer retention and improve strategic decision making 
our platform is offered on a subscription basis  deployable in a private or public cloud and used for internal or external communities 
we generate revenues from platform license fees as well as from professional service fees for configuration  implementation and training 
we sell our comprehensive jive social business platform across two principal communities internally for employees within the enterprise and externally for customers and partners outside the enterprise 
internally focused communities comprised of our jive social business platform revenues in as the market for social business software within the enterprise continues to grow  we expect revenues from internally focused communities to continue to be higher than revenues generated from externally focused communities 
we offer our platform both as a public cloud service and as a private cloud solution 
in march  we released jive cloud  one of our public cloud services that is on a quarterly release cycle and is a non customizable version of our platform 
additionally  in may  we released try jive  a day free trial version of the jive cloud offering 
try jive is a sales enablement tool  targeted at departments within larger organizations with the intent of driving viral adoption organically within the enterprise 
in  product revenues from all public cloud deployments  including jive cloud  represented of total product revenues 
with the release of jive cloud and try jive  we anticipate that  over the long term  public cloud deployments of our platform will comprise an increasing portion of our business 
historically  we have generated the largest portion of our revenues from sales to customers within the united states 
revenues from customers in the united states accounted for of total revenues in we are continuing to focus on expanding our sales headcount and channel partners internationally  and we anticipate the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the united states will increase in the future 
in response to our growing customer base outside of the united states  as well as the increase in public cloud deployments  we opened an internally managed data center in the netherlands in additionally  we plan to continue our investment in our hosting infrastructure by opening another internally managed data center in asia in as we continue to focus on international expansion in the region 

table of contents during  we acquired two businesses to enhance and strengthen our platform 
on november   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of producteev llc  or producteev  a cloud based project and task management company 
the total purchase consideration of million was comprised entirely of cash 
on november   we also acquired all of the outstanding shares of meetings 
io  a cloud based real time video  chat and screen sharing collaboration company 
the total purchase consideration of million was comprised of million in cash and  shares of our common stock with a fair value on november  of million 
we also issued  shares of common stock subject to repurchase to certain meetings 
io employees which vest over a three year period contingent upon the continued employment of the recipients 
the fair value of these shares on the grant date was million  which is being recognized as stock based compensation over the three year vesting period 
also in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a partnership with the consultancy  pwc us  which will pair our social business platform with pwc s consulting services in order to help our customers implement and realize the benefits of our platform 
we expect to continue to invest in partnership programs and other indirect sales channels in order to continue to grow our customer base 
seasonality our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new billings and renewals 
this pattern may be amplified over time if the number of customers with renewal dates occurring in the fourth quarter continues to increase 
furthermore  our quarterly sales cycles are frequently weighted toward the end of the quarter  with an increased volume of sales in the last few weeks of each quarter 
the year over year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity has historically resulted in the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter increasing in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year 
we expect this trend to continue in and in future years 
non gaap key metrics in addition to gaap metrics such as total revenues and gross margin  we also regularly review billings  a non gaap measure  and the number of jive social business platform customers to evaluate our business  measure our performance  identify trends affecting our business  allocate capital and make strategic decisions 
billings the following tables set forth a reconciliation of total revenues to billings dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change total revenues deferred revenue  end of period less deferred revenue  beginning of period billings year ended december  dollar change change total revenues deferred revenue  end of period less deferred revenue  beginning of period billings we monitor billings  a non gaap measure  in addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with gaap to manage our business  make planning decisions  evaluate our performance and allocate resources 
we believe that this non gaap measure offers valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of our business  and it will help investors better understand the sales volumes and performance of our business 

table of contents our use of billings has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for total revenues or an analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are billings is not a substitute for total revenues  as billings are recognized when invoiced  while revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term  billings can include fees paid for license terms greater than months and for subscription renewals prior to the expiration of the current subscription term and  therefore  does not always closely match with the timing of delivery of support  maintenance  and hosting services and the costs associated with delivering those services  changes to the composition of current period billings may impact the correlation of current period billings to future period revenues  billings would not exclude any agreements that contain customer acceptance provisions or other contractual contingencies that would require deferral of revenue required under gaap  and other companies  including companies in our industry  may not use billings  may calculate non gaap measures differently or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance  all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non gaap measures as comparative measures 
we consider billings a significant performance measure and a leading indicator of future recognized revenue based on our business model of billing for subscription licenses annually and recognizing revenue ratably over the subscription term 
the billings we record in any particular period reflect sales to new customers plus subscription renewals and upsell to existing customers  and represent amounts invoiced for product subscription license fees and professional services 
we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon initiation of the initial contract or subsequent renewal 
in addition  we also enter into arrangements with customers to purchase subscriptions for a term greater than months  most typically months 
for subscriptions greater than months  the customer has the option of being invoiced annually or paying for the full term of the subscription at the time the contract is signed 
if the customer elects to pay the full multi year amount at the time the contract is signed  the total amount billed for the entire term will be reflected in billings 
if the customer elects to be invoiced annually  only the amount billed for the month period will be included in billings 
the portion of subscription terms under contract and not yet invoiced is considered backlog and is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue 
as of december  and  we had backlog of approximately million and million  respectively 
of the million in backlog as of december   approximately is expected to be billed and recognized as revenue within billings for consulting services typically occur on a bi weekly basis as the services are delivered 
the increases in billings in the periods presented were primarily driven by increased upsell of our products to existing customers and the addition of new customers 
jive social business platform customers we define the number of platform customers at the end of any given measurement period by counting every customer under active contract for the jive social business platform that carries a balance in our deferred revenue account at the end of that period 
while a single customer may have multiple internal and external communities to support distinct departments  operating segments or geographies  we only include that customer once for purposes of this metric 
the jive social business platform includes jive cloud 
we believe the number of jive social business platform customers is a leading indicator of our future revenues  billings and upsell opportunities 

table of contents our jive social business platform customer count was as follows december  change change jive platform customer count december  change change jive platform customer count our product revenue growth was and  respectively in compared to and in compared to our product revenues have grown at a faster rate than our customer count as we have realized greater upsell with our existing customers 
components of results of operations revenues we generate revenues primarily in the form of software subscription fees and professional services for strategic consulting  configuration  implementation and other services related to our software 
we offer our products with subscription terms typically ranging from to months 
in addition to sales of our platform  our revenues include fees for sales of modules  additional users and page views 
while subscription based licenses make up the substantial majority of our product revenues  in limited instances we license our software to customers on a perpetual basis  with ongoing support and maintenance services 
revenues generated through the sale of subscription licenses also include fees for updates and maintenance 
we recognize revenue from professional services ratably over the subscription term when they are bundled with a subscription license  because we do not have fair value of all the various services 
these amounts  when recognized  are classified as professional services revenues on our consolidated statements of operations based on the hourly rates at which they are billed 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues includes all direct costs to produce and distribute our product offerings  including data center and support personnel  depreciation and maintenance related to equipment located at our hosting service providers and in our jive managed data centers  salaries  rent for our data centers  web hosting services expense for public cloud and jive cloud implementations  third party royalty costs  benefits  amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock based compensation 
cost of professional services revenues includes all direct costs to provide our professional services  which primarily include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for our professional services personnel  as wells as consulting and outside services 
we recognize expenses related to our professional services organization as they are incurred  while the majority of associated professional services revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription term 
cost of revenues also includes allocated overhead costs for facilities and information technology 
allocated costs for facilities consist of rent and depreciation of equipment and leasehold improvements related to our facilities 
our allocated costs for information technology include costs for compensation of our information technology personnel and the cost associated with our information technology infrastructure 
our overhead costs are allocated to all departments based on headcount 
we expect that cost of revenues may increase in the future depending on the growth rate of our new customers and billings and our need to support the implementation  hosting and support of those new customers 
we also expect that cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues could fluctuate from period to period depending on growth of our services business and any associated costs relating to the delivery of services  the timing of sales of products that have royalties associated with them  the amount and timing of amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and the timing of significant expenditures 

table of contents research and development to date  research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred 
to the extent that we develop software classified as internal use in the future  we may be required to capitalize the related development expenses 
these expenses include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for our engineers and developers  allocated facilities costs and payments to third parties for research and development of new software 
we focus our research and development efforts on developing new versions of our platform with new and expanded features and enhancing the ease of use of our platform 
we believe that continued investment in our technology is important for our future growth  and  as a result  we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars although they may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries  incentive compensation and benefits  travel expense  marketing program fees  partner referral fees and stock based compensation 
sales incentive compensation is recorded as earned as a component of sales and marketing expense 
sales incentive compensation is generally earned at the time a customer enters into a binding purchase agreement while associated revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses include customer acquisition marketing  branding  advertising  customer events and public relations costs  as well as allocated facilities costs 
we plan to continue investing heavily in sales and marketing to expand our global operations  increase revenues from current customers  build brand awareness and expand our indirect sales channel 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and remain our largest expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  although they may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for our executive  finance  legal  information technology  human resources and other administrative employees 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include legal and accounting services  outside consulting  facilities and other supporting overhead costs not allocated to other departments 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our business domestically and internationally and incur additional expenses associated with being a publicly traded company 
other expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest expense on our outstanding debt and foreign exchange gains and losses  as well as income related to our investments 
in addition  the and periods include changes in the fair value of our series c preferred stock warrants 
the series c preferred stock warrants were exercised late in the third quarter of and  therefore  we will not incur charges related to these warrants in subsequent periods 
provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the united states and income taxes in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
since we have generated net losses  we have placed a valuation allowance against any potential future benefits for loss carryforwards and research and development and other tax credits 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets  including goodwill  and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results  our future financial statements will be affected 

table of contents we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we generate revenues in the form of product fees and related professional service fees 
product fees include subscription fees  perpetual license fees  associated support and maintenance fees and hosting fees 
professional services primarily consist of fees for configuration  training  consultation and implementation services  which are not essential to functionality 
for statement of operations classification purposes  we allocate revenues to professional services based on the hourly rate billed for time and materials arrangements and based on the total fixed fee for fixed fee professional services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product or services have been delivered to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and the collection of the related fees is reasonably assured 
signed agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement 
if a contract signed by the customer does not exist  we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist  we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
software and corresponding license keys are delivered to customers electronically 
electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer with access to the software 
we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we do not generally offer extended payment terms with typical terms of payment due between and days from delivery of product or services 
however  for professional services that are billable under a time and materials based arrangement  these fees are neither fixed nor determinable until the work is performed and the fee becomes billable to the customer 
we assess collectability of the customer receivable based on a number of factors such as collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until collectability becomes reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of cash 
we offer subscriptions of our solutions to customers most frequently on a term basis with terms typically ranging from to months 
while term based licenses make up the majority of our total revenues  we have occasionally licensed our solutions to customers on a perpetual basis with on going support and maintenance services 
we recognize license revenue in accordance with software industry specific guidance 
revenues related to term license fees are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the date the customer has access to the software license key and continuing through the end of the contract term 
for term based licenses  we do not charge separately for standard support and maintenance  and  therefore  inherent in the license fees are fees for support and maintenance services for the duration of the license term 
as fees for support and maintenance are always bundled with the license over the entire term of the contract  we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for support and maintenance 
revenues generated from perpetual license sales also include support and maintenance services for an initial stated term  both the perpetual license and support and maintenance are recognized ratably over the initial stated term 
we do not have vsoe of fair value for support and maintenance on perpetual licenses as we have not had sufficient consistently priced standalone sales of support and maintenance 
in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology  we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted 
once delivery occurs  we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 

table of contents license arrangements may also include professional services  such as installation and training services  which are typically delivered early in the contract term 
this combination of products and services represents a multiple element arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
we have determined that we do not have vsoe of fair value for each element of a multiple element sales arrangement and  accordingly  we account for fees received under that multiple element arrangement as a single unit of accounting and recognize the fees for the entire arrangement ratably  commencing on delivery of the software  over the longer of the term of the support and maintenance or the period over which professional services are delivered 
support and maintenance is always the last undelivered element in the arrangement and  therefore  we recognize the fixed portion of the fees ratably over the support and maintenance term 
for contracts with multiple elements  we recognize the license  support and maintenance  and fixed fee professional service revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning upon delivery of the software 
we believe this method most closely reflects the economics of the transaction as we deliver access to the software and we begin providing support and maintenance services as of the date the software is delivered 
professional services are offered on both our fixed fee and our time and materials hourly billing arrangements 
for time and materials based professional services that are part of a multiple element arrangement where the fees for the professional services are not fixed or determinable upon delivery of the software  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term as the related fees become fixed 
these fees are not considered fixed at the outset of the arrangement and become fixed as the related work is performed and the fees are earned and billed 
these services are typically provided early in the contract term with completion typically occurring in the first six months 
as these fees become fixed  they are added to the total fee for the multiple element arrangement and recognized ratably with all other arrangement fees over the entire contract term 
when billed  a cumulative revenue catch up is calculated as the revenue earned from the date the software was made available to the customer to the date services have been completed  with recognition continuing ratably to the end of the contract term 
these amounts  when recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  are classified as professional services revenues based on the hourly rates at which they are billed 
if there are significant acceptance clauses associated with the license or services or uncertainty associated with our ability to perform the professional services  revenues are deferred until the acceptance is received or the uncertainty is resolved 
we record amounts that have been invoiced  in accordance with the terms of the agreement  in accounts receivable and in deferred revenues or revenues  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
hosting revenues are derived from providing our software solutions in a hosted environment where the customer does not take possession of the software on their premises 
with the exception of jive cloud  customers have the option to elect to take possession of the software and install on their premises or sub contract the hosting services through us 
such arrangements are considered software sales as the customer has the same rights to the software license regardless of their election to have us host on their behalf or install on their premises 
as a result  the fees associated with license  support and hosted services are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement 
for jive cloud licensing arrangements  customers do not have the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud based application service at any time 
we occasionally sell professional services separately and recognize revenues resulting from those as professional services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
if acceptance provisions exist within a professional services arrangement  revenues will be deferred until the services are accepted  the acceptance period has expired or cash is received from the customer 
our policy is to record revenues net of any applicable sales  use or excise taxes 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability or refusal of our customers to make required payments 
in establishing the required allowance  management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the customers financial condition  the amount of receivables in dispute  the current receivables aging and current payment patterns 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable balances on a quarterly basis 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and million at december  and  respectively 
bad debt expense was million in and million and if the financial conditions of our customers were to materially change or there were other circumstances that resulted in their inability to pay  the estimates of recoverability of receivables could materially change 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of acquired entities 
we perform a goodwill impairment test annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred 
such events or circumstances may include significant adverse changes in the general business climate  among other things 
in  we adopted account standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which allows us to make a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
we elected to forgo step zero  qualitative assessment  and proceed to the first step of the test for goodwill impairment 
step one of the impairment test is performed by determining the reporting unit s fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows and considering the estimated fair market value of our common stock 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit  which represents the activities of the entire company 
if the reporting unit s carrying value is less than its fair value  then the fair value is allocated to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the fair value was the purchase price to acquire us 
the excess of the fair value over the amounts assigned to our assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill of million as of december  relates to our acquisitions of producteev and meetings 
io  which occurred in november  our acquisition of offisync  which occurred in may and to our acquisition of filtrbox  which occurred in january our impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of  and did not indicate any impairment of goodwill as the fair value of our business substantially exceeded its carrying value in all periods presented 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is estimated to become more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  we currently maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance totaled million and million  respectively  as of december  and uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as tax expense within our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had total unrecognized tax benefits of million 
all unrecognized tax benefits would currently not have an impact on the effective tax rate if recognized 
the interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including stock options and restricted stock  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we use the black scholes merton valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
the fair value is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the respective award 
the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our common stock fair value  as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables  including our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options  stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 

table of contents if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes merton model changes significantly  stock based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously 
we account for stock options issued to nonemployees based on the estimated fair value of the awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the measurement of stock based compensation is subject to quarterly adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest and the resulting change in fair value is recognized in our consolidated statement of operations during the period the related services are rendered

table of contents revenues certain revenue information was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change products professional services total revenues year ended december  dollar change change products professional services total revenues products revenues the increase in products revenues in compared to was primarily the result of an overall increase in the average annual subscription value of a customer  as a result of the realization of greater upsell on our existing customers  and increases in the aggregate number of total customers on the jive social business platform  including jive cloud  which grew from as of december  to as of december  the average new customer subscription size decreased approximately in compared to  primarily due to the impact of our jive cloud offering released in excluding the impact of jive cloud  the average new customer subscription size increased approximately in compared to while jive cloud transactions are typically initially smaller than our traditional public and private cloud transactions  we believe jive cloud will contribute to significant upsell opportunities in future periods 
the increase in products revenues in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in the average annual subscription transaction size and an increase in the aggregate number of customers on the jive platform  which grew from as of december  to as of december  the increase in the average annual subscription transaction size was primarily due to the combination of the effects of upsell transactions with our existing customers and new customer additions  as we continued to focus on initiating and building more strategic and pervasive customer relationships with both our prospects and our existing customers 
certain information regarding our revenues was as follows year ended december  dollar value of total revenues generated in the us million million million percentage of total revenues generated in the us product revenues from public cloud deployments as a percentage of total product revenues product revenues from private cloud deployments as a percentage of total product revenues percentage of jive social business platform revenues that represented internally focused communities percentage of jive social business platform revenues that represented externally focused communities additionally  renewal rates  excluding upsell  remained above for transactions over  in  and professional services revenues in compared to  professional services revenues as a percent of product revenues decreased by percentage points as continued enhancements of the core product have decreased the amount of customization requested by customers 
this was also driven by our most recent release  jive cloud  a public cloud  non customizable version of our jive platform 

table of contents the increase in professional services revenues in compared to was primarily due to increased demand for customization and unique branding related to the increase in overall products revenues 
however  the percentage increase in professional services revenues was percentage points less than the prior year period increase in products revenues due to the increased mix of products revenues generated from renewals  which typically require less professional services support

these factors were partially offset by a decrease in third party consulting fees of million 
headcount in our hosting department remained consistent during the year with employees as of december  and increased costs in hosting in compared to relate to the increase in mix of revenues towards our public cloud deployment models  our programs to scale our public cloud capabilities for future growth and an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles as a result of acquisitions 
additionally  headcount in our support organization grew from as of december  to as of december  the increase in products gross margin was driven by efficiencies gained through utilization of our internally managed data centers as we continue to transition our existing public cloud customers from a third party hosting service  as well as deploying our new public cloud customers directly to our managed data centers 
the increase in cost of revenues for products in compared to was primarily due to the increase in products revenues and included a million increase in salaries and benefits  a million increase in third party hosting services  a million increase in third party royalties  a million increase in third party consulting fees  a million increase in acquisition related charges and a million increase in allocations for it and facilities costs 
additionally  transition of our data center infrastructure to a model in which we own our data center equipment resulted in an increase in related depreciation and maintenance expense of million 
the decline in products gross margin in compared to was attributable to our third party data center costs and increased headcount in our hosting department due to the increase in mix of revenue towards our public cloud deployment model and scaling for future growth  and an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles 

table of contents cost of revenues professional services in compared to  cost of revenues for professional services related to salaries and benefits increased million and also increased million related to travel and consulting costs 
the decrease in the professional services gross margin in compared to was primarily due to lower professional service revenues as a percentage of total revenues  as a result of our most recent release  jive cloud  which is a non customizable version of our jive platform 
additionally  we offer professional services on both fixed fee and time and materials hourly billing arrangements 
for time and materials based professional services that are part of a multiple element arrangement where the fees for the professional services are not fixed or determinable upon delivery of the software  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term as the related fees become fixed 
we also sell professional services separately  outside of multiple element arrangements  and recognize revenues resulting from those as professional services are delivered 
professional services revenues recognized from non multiple element arrangements  as a percentage of total professional services revenues  in were percentage points less than in  resulting in a greater percentage of the professional services revenues related to professional services performed in the current twelve month period being recognized ratably over the contract term  which typically extends beyond the current period 
furthermore  we experienced decreased utilization of our existing full time professional services employees in compared to the increase in cost of revenues for professional services in compared to was primarily due to the increase in professional services revenues  partially offset by improvements related to the improved proportion of full time professional services employees in relation to the more expensive third party consultants  and included a million increase in salaries and benefits and a million increase in allocations for it and facilities costs  partially offset by a million decrease in third party consulting fees 
the increase in the professional services gross margin in compared to was primarily due to the conversion of third party consultants to full time employees  as well as increased utilization of our existing full time professional services employees

the increase in salaries and benefits was a result of increasing our research and development headcount from as of december  to as of december   and includes a million increase in stock based compensation
