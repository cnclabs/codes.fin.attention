item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto found in part ii  item of this report 
all references to the years  and mean the twelve month periods ended december   and  respectively 
unless the context otherwise requires  nautilus  we  us and our refer to nautilus  inc and its subsidiaries 
unless indicated otherwise  all information regarding our operating results pertains to our continuing operations 
our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period 
our revenues typically fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry  customer buying patterns  product innovation  the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products  our ability to procure products to meet customer demand  the level of spending on  and effectiveness of  our media and advertising programs and our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing sales relationships 
in addition  our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors  including  among other things  the overall condition of the economy and the availability of consumer credit in both the united states and canada 
our profit margins may vary in response to the aforementioned factors and our ability to manage product costs 
profit margins may also be affected by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products  product warranty costs  higher or lower fuel prices  and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing related services 
our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization 
historically  our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and air television advertisements of our products  facility costs  operating costs of our information and communications systems  product supply chain management  customer support and new product development activities 
in addition  our operating expenses have been affected from time to time by asset impairment charges  restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses 
as a result of the above and other factors  our period to period operating results may not be indicative of future performance 
you should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies  both within and outside our industry 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and  consequently  we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability 
for more information  see our discussion of risk factors located at part i  item a of this report 
overview we are committed to providing innovative  quality solutions to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle 
our principal business activities include designing  developing  sourcing and marketing high quality cardiovascular and strength fitness products and related accessories for consumer home use  primarily in the united states and canada 
our products are sold under some of the most recognized brand names in the fitness industry nautilus  bowflex  schwinn  schwinn fitness and universal 
we market our products through two distinct distribution channels  direct and retail  which we consider to be separate business segments 
our direct business offers products directly to consumers through television advertising  the internet and catalogs 
our retail business offers our products through a network of third party retailers with stores and websites located in the united states and internationally 
we also derive a portion of our revenues from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property 
our net sales in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to net sales of million in  largely due to higher sales of cardio products  especially the bowflex treadclimber  which we believe was driven by increased advertising effectiveness  improved call center effectiveness and higher us consumer credit approval rates 
income from continuing operations was million in  compared to million for income from continuing operations was per diluted share in  compared to per diluted share in the significant improvement in our results from continuing operations was primarily attributable to increased sales and higher gross margin in our direct business  compared to results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
we have not made any material changes in the methodologies we use in our critical accounting estimates during the past three fiscal years 
if our assumptions or estimates change in future periods  the impact on our financial position and operating results could be material 
sales discounts and allowances product sales and shipping revenues are reported net of promotional discounts and return allowances 
we estimate the revenue impact of retail sales incentive programs based on the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if the amount of our retail sales incentives can be reasonably estimated  we record the impact of such incentives at the later of the time we notify our customer of the sales incentive  or the time of the sale 
if actual amounts differ from our estimates  revenue is adjusted 
our calculation of amounts owed for sales discounts and allowances contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions in interim periods and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including estimated future customer inventory purchases and returns 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation we evaluate our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired 
finite lived intangible assets  including patents and patent rights  are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
no goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges were recognized in or our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values 
our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows  market conditions  relative levels of risk  the cost of capital  terminal values  royalty rates  and the allocation of revenues  expenses and assets and liabilities to business segments 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets and  thereby  could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
product warranty obligations our products carry limited defined warranties for defects in materials or workmanship 
our product warranties generally obligate us to pay for the cost of replacement parts  cost of shipping the parts to our customers and  in certain instances  service labor costs 
at the time of sale  we record a liability for the estimated costs of fulfilling future warranty claims 
the estimated warranty costs are recorded as a component of cost of sales  based on historical warranty claim experience and available product quality data 
if necessary  we adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
our estimates of warranty expenses are based on significant judgment  and the frequency and cost of warranty claims are subject to variation 
warranty expenses are affected by the performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to the customer  product failure rates and variances in expected repair costs 
litigation and loss contingencies from time to time  we may be involved in claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and any losses or gains we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
we record expenses for litigation and loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of internal and external counsel  outcomes from similar litigation  status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates accordingly 

table of contents deferred tax assets valuation allowance we account for income taxes based on the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be included  as income or expense  in the applicable tax return 
the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the enactment 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
as we determined  based on reviewing all the positive and negative evidence  that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of million 
if our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets  the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant judgments are required in determining tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
such judgments require us to interpret existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our circumstances 
in particular  our valuation allowance contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the future realization of net deferred tax assets 
if our financial results or other relevant facts change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position  significant judgment would be applied in determining the effect of the change on our valuation allowance

combined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary us third party financing providers increased to in from in we expect us consumer credit financing approval rates in approximately consistent with the level 
the increase in direct sales of cardio products was partially offset by a decline in direct sales of strength products  primarily rod based home gyms 
the decline in sales of rod based home gyms is attributable in part to the cessation of television advertising for these products  as management determined that television ad spending on this mature product category was generating unsatisfactory returns 
we have marketed rod based home gyms through more cost efficient online media since early cost of sales of our direct business increased by to million in  compared to million in of this million increase in cost of sales  approximately million was due to higher sales volume  partially offset by a million decrease in cost of sales primarily attributable to a shift in product sales mix and a million reduction in supply chain costs  including freight

table of contents gross margin of our retail business was in  a decrease of basis points compared to  as the retail price increase we implemented in the third quarter of was more than offset by less absorption of fixed supply chain costs due to lower sales volume  compared to operating expenses operating expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to operating expenses of million in as a percent of revenue  operating expenses remained unchanged at of net sales 
the increase in operating expenses was largely due to an increase of million in selling and marketing expense and a million increase in research and development expense 
in addition  general and administrative expenses increased by million in  compared to selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to  mainly due to higher advertising expense of our direct business

general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to  primarily due to increases in information technology and legal expenses totaling million  partially offset by reductions of million in depreciation and amortization expenses and million in personnel costs 
research and development research and development expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to  as we increased our investment in new product development resources and capabilities 
other income and expense interest expense negative interest expense of million in arose from the prepayment in march of our increasing rate senior discount notes 
early repayment of the notes resulted in a lower average effective interest rate over the term of the notes than would have applied if the notes had been held to maturity 
in periods preceding the repayment date  we used the average effective interest rate as if the notes were held to maturity in determining the amount of interest expense incurred 
interest expense was million in we have not borrowed under our current financing agreement with bank of the west  other than to fund our outstanding letters of credit 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
other expense other expense was million in  compared to less than million in  primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
income tax expense income tax benefit was million in  compared to income tax expense of million in income tax benefit in primarily relates to the expiration of statutes of limitation applicable to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions 
income tax expense in was attributable to the taxable income generated in canada and the result of the company uncertain tax positions 
generally we did not recognize us income tax expense associated with our income from continuing operations for and due to the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 

table of contents discontinued operation income from discontinued operation  net of income taxes  was million in  compared to a loss of million in in the fourth quarter of  we substantially completed the liquidation of our investment in foreign subsidiaries formerly associated with the commercial business 
as a result  an accumulated translation adjustment of million was removed as a separate component of equity and recognized as a gain of the discontinued operation 
loss from discontinued operation in was net of a reduction of million in the amount of pre tax disposal loss previously estimated in connection with the divestiture of our commercial business 
some expenses may be incurred in in connection with the settlement of contingencies arising from and directly related to our commercial business prior to its disposal

we have marketed rod based home gyms through more cost efficient online media since early in september  we completed our transition to a new consumer credit program with a new primary third party financing provider  ge capital retail bank  formerly ge money bank ge 
the relationship with ge has expanded the ability of our customers to obtain third party consumer financing for buying our products 
in addition  we added one secondary third party consumer credit financing provider during the third quarter of and another in early  both of which offer credit to certain qualified consumers whose credit applications have been declined by ge

beginning in early  we shifted the marketing of home gyms from television advertising to more cost efficient online media 
lower comparable direct advertising expenses were offset in part by higher consumer credit financing costs  as a result of sequentially improving consumer credit approval rates  and the availability of additional secondary consumer financing providers in  as compared to general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to  primarily due to lower depreciation expense

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of december  the principal source of this increase in liquidity was cash provided by operating activities of million in  compared to million in management believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet our expected cash needs for at least the next twelve months  based on cash currently on hand and anticipated cash flows from operations 
cash provided by operating activities of million in consisted primarily of income from continuing operations of million

financing arrangements 
table of contents we have a credit agreement the loan agreement with bank of the west that  as amended and restated on march   provides for a  maximum revolving secured credit line 
the line of credit is available through march  for working capital  standby letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
borrowing availability under the loan agreement is subject to our compliance with certain financial and operating covenants at the time borrowings are requested 
standby letters of credit under the loan agreement are treated as a reduction of the available borrowing amount and are subject to covenant testing 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the loan agreement is based on either  at our discretion  bank of the west base rate  a floating rate or libor  plus an applicable margin based on certain company financial performance metrics 
our borrowing rate was as of december  the loan agreement contains customary covenants  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and leverage ratio  and limitations on capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  indebtedness  liens  dispositions  dividends and investments 
the loan agreement also contains customary events of default 
upon an event of default  the lender has the option of terminating its credit commitment and accelerating all obligations under the loan agreement 
borrowings under the loan agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including intellectual property assets 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and million in standby letters of credit issued under the loan agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the loan agreement and approximately million was available for borrowing 
on september   we entered into a note purchase agreement the purchase agreement with certain entities collectively  the sherborne purchasers under common control of sherborne investors gp  llc and its affiliates collectively sherborne 
sherborne was formerly our largest shareholder and is controlled by edward j 
bramson  the company former chairman and chief executive officer  and craig l 
mckibben  a former member of our board of directors 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we issued to the sherborne purchasers  in aggregate principal amount at maturity of increasing rate senior discount notes due december  the notes 
the notes had an original principal amount totaling  and an original maturity date of december  on march   the maturity date of the notes was automatically extended under certain terms of the purchase agreement to may  on july   beneficial interest in the notes was assigned by the sherborne purchasers pro rata to their respective investors in the manner permitted by the purchase agreement 
such assignment was made in connection with the resignation of messrs 
bramson and mckibben from their respective positions with nautilus on may   and the subsequent pro rata distribution by certain sherborne affiliated entities to their respective investors of the common stock of nautilus owned by such entities 
we repaid all amounts outstanding under the notes on march  if all of the notes were paid on the original maturity date  the effective rate of interest over the term of the purchase agreement would have been approximately per annum  which was the rate at which interest expense was accrued in periods preceding the repayment date 
the actual effective rate of interest through the repayment date was approximately per annum 
non cancelable contractual obligations our operating cash flows include the effect of certain non cancelable  contractual obligations 
a summary of such obligations as of december   including those related to our discontinued commercial operation  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty obligations total our purchase obligations are comprised primarily of inventory purchase commitments 
because substantially all of our inventory is sourced from asia  we have long lead times and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance 

table of contents due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions  have been excluded from the contractual table above 
for further information  refer to note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services  agreements with customers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to the use of their property  agreements with licensees or licensors  under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property  and agreements with parties to debt arrangements  under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnifications 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no liabilities are recorded at december  seasonality we expect our sales from fitness equipment products to vary seasonally 
sales are typically strongest in the first and fourth quarters  followed by the third quarter  and are generally weakest in the second quarter 
we believe that various factors  such as the broadcast of network season finales and seasonal weather patterns  influence television viewers and cause our advertising on cable television stations to be less effective in the second quarter than in other periods 
in addition  during the spring and summer months  consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities  including outdoor exercise  which impacts sales of indoor fitness equipment 
this seasonality can have a significant effect on our inventory levels  working capital needs and resource utilization 
new accounting pronouncements in the first quarter of  we adopted accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu  which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
asu amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have any effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  which amends the guidance in accounting standards topic  intangibles goodwill and other  on testing indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment 
under asu  entities testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment would have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset 
if an entity determines  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the indefinite lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired  a quantitative fair value calculation would not be needed 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   although early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu will not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
this asu requires an entity to disclose additional information with respect to changes in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci balances by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  since asu relates entirely to disclosure  the adoption of this standard will not have any effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
