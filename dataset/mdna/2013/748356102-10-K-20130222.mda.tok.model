expenses cost of natural gas sold decreased in compared to and increased in compared to the decrease was due to a decrease in volumes sold  and a decrease in the purchase cost of natural gas 
the increase was due to a increase in volumes sold  partially offset by a decrease in the purchase cost of natural gas 
cost of natural gas from affiliates includes cost of service gas supplies from wexpro and transportation and storage from questar pipeline 
these costs increased in and in due to wexpro higher investment in gas development properties resulting in higher volumes of cost of service gas 
wexpro provided of questar gas natural gas supply in  in and in questar gas accounts for purchased gas costs in accordance with procedures authorized by the pscu and the pscw 
purchased gas costs that are different from those provided for in present rates are accumulated and recovered or credited through future rate changes 
during the second quarter of  questar gas credited customers with million of gas costs previously collected from customers in excess of costs incurred 
in addition  the gas cost portion of rates was reduced by million

under this rate design  all fixed costs of providing service  including depreciation and return on investment  are recovered through the demand charge 
about of questar pipeline costs are fixed and recovered through these demand charges 
questar pipeline earnings are driven primarily by demand revenues from firm shippers 
since only about of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges  changes in transportation volumes do not have a significant impact on earnings 
questar pipeline has three primary sources of ngl revenue 
these sources include two major regulated processing facilities and an unregulated subsidiary that provides third party processing services

critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions questar significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
the company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
gas and oil reserves gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  production history  and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and other taxes  capital expenditures and remediation costs 
the subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
changes in expected performance from the properties and economic data can result in a revision to the amount of estimated reserves held by the company 
if reserves are revised upward  operating results could be affected due to lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense per unit of production 
likewise  if reserves are revised downward  operating results could be affected due to higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense or a potential writedown of a property book value if an impairment is warranted 
asset impairments when a triggering event occurs  questar evaluates assets for possible impairment using estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
triggering events may include operating losses or significant changes in contracts  revenues and expenses for a specific asset 
impairment losses are recorded when the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the current net book value of the asset 
the amount of impairment loss recorded is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the current net book value 
the fair value is generally estimated using discounted future cash flows 
estimates of the undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of the asset require significant assumptions for many years into the future regarding revenues and expenses for assets evaluated for impairment 
changes in assumptions may make a difference in whether or not an asset is impaired and in the amount of the impairment 
unbilled revenues questar gas estimates revenues on a calendar basis even though bills are sent to customers on a cycle basis throughout the month 
the company estimates unbilled revenues for the period from the date meters are read to the end of the month  using customer usage history and weather information 
approximately one half month of revenues is estimated in any period 
the gas costs and other variable costs are recorded on the same basis to ensure proper matching of revenues and expenses 
questar gas has a cet 
under the cet  questar gas non gas revenues are decoupled from the volume of gas used by customers 
the tariff specifies a margin per customer for each month with differences to be deferred and recovered from customers or refunded to customers through periodic rate adjustments 
differences between questar gas estimate of unbilled revenues and actual revenues subsequently billed do not have a significant impact on operating results because of the cet 
regulatory assets and liabilities questar gas and questar pipeline follow accounting standards on regulated operations that require the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities by companies subject to cost based regulation 
regulatory assets are recorded if it is probable that a cost will be recoverable in the future through regulated rates 
regulatory liabilities are recorded if it is probable that future rates will be reduced for a current item 
the company makes assumptions about the probability of future rate changes 
the company regulatory assets and liabilities are supported by orders  rulings and practices of the regulatory agencies 
allowance for bad debts questar gas records an allowance for bad debts based on its experience with collecting accounts receivable 
the amount recorded at the end of each period is the estimated net writeoffs of its outstanding accounts receivable  including unbilled revenues 
the company uses writeoff history  accounts receivable aging reports  and specific evaluation of large customers to estimate the allowance for bad debts 
questar gas recovers bad debt costs related to the gas cost portion of rates in its utah operations through a purchased gas adjustment to rates 
employee pension and postretirement benefit plans the company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and a life insurance plan covering a majority of its employees and a postretirement medical plan providing coverage to less than half of its employees 
the calculation of the company expense and liability associated with its benefit plans requires the use of assumptions that the company deems to be critical 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expenses and liabilities and actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
independent consultants hired by the company use actuarial models to calculate estimates of pension and postretirement benefits expense 
the models use key factors such as mortality estimations  liability discount rates  long term rates of return on investments  rates of compensation increases  amortized gain or loss from investments and medical cost trend rates 
management formulates assumptions based on market indicators and advice from consultants 
the company believes that the liability discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on benefit plan assets are critical assumptions 
the assumed liability discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled and considers the rates of return available on a portfolio of high quality  fixed income investments 
the company discounted its future qualified pension liabilities using rates of as of december   and as of december  a decrease in the discount rate would increase the company estimated annual qualified pension expense by about million 
the expected long term rate of return on qualified benefit plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested for purposes of paying pension benefits 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year giving consideration to the benefit plan investment mix and historical and forecast rates of return on these types of securities 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company was as of january   and january  benefit plan expense typically increases as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets decreases 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return would cause an approximate million increase in the qualified pension expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk questar gas primary market risk exposures arise from changes in demand for natural gas and competition from other energy sources 
the demand for natural gas will vary based on economic conditions  conservation efforts and prices 
the temperature adjusted usage per residential customer has decreased over time due to more energy efficient appliances and homes  and behavior changes in response to changing natural gas prices 
the economic impact of this decline in usage per customer has been somewhat offset by the addition of new customers and the cet 
wexpro operations are subject to various government controls and regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
wexpro must obtain permits to drill and produce  maintain bonding requirements to drill and operate wells  submit and implement spill prevention plans  and file notices relating to the presence  use  and release of specified contaminants incidental to gas and oil production 
wexpro is also subject to various conservation matters  including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units  the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of gas and oil properties 
in addition  the utah division of public utilities and the staff of the pscw are entitled to monitor the performance of the company and wexpro under the wexpro agreement and have retained two monitors  an independent certified public accountant and an independent petroleum engineer  to review the performance of the agreement 
questar pipeline primary market risk exposures arise from changes in demand for transportation and storage services and competition from other pipelines 
the demand for transportation and storage services will vary based on the market expectations about future volumes of natural gas likely to be produced in the basins served by questar pipeline and changes in market demand for natural gas 
on some portions of its pipeline system the company faces the risk that it will not be successful in recontracting capacity under current terms once existing contracts expire 
revenue may be reduced if ngl market prices or volumes decline 
credit risk questar gas requires deposits from customers that pose unfavorable credit risks 
no single customer accounted for a significant portion of revenue in questar pipeline requests credit support  such as letters of credit and cash deposits  from companies that pose unfavorable credit risks 
all companies posing such concerns were current on their accounts at december  questar pipeline largest customers include questar gas  rockies express pipeline  wyoming interstate pipeline  eog resources  encana marketing  pacificorp  anadarko energy services and shell energy north america 
interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to change as interest rates fluctuate 
the company ability to borrow and the rates quoted by lenders can be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets 
the company had  million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of  million and a weighted average life to maturity of years at december  this compared to  million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of  million and a weighted average life to maturity of years at december  if interest rates had declined  fair value would increase to  million in and  million in the fair value calculations do not represent the cost to retire the debt securities 
in december  questar issued million of senior notes due in the second quarter of  questar executed a fixed to floating interest rate swap transaction with a counterparty and converted million of its fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt 
questar settled this hedge transaction in march  for a deferred gain of million  which is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining debt term
