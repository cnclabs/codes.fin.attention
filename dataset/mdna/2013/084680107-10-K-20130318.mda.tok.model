item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion 
the accounting and reporting policies followed by the company conform  in all material respects  to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
while the company bases estimates on historical experience  current information and other factors deemed to be relevant  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec s definition allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the financial statement date and which may be estimated 
management uses historical information  as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
although management believes that it uses appropriate available information to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
conditions in the local economy and real estate values could require the company to increase provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
acquired loans 
loans that the company acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses 
determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest 
going forward  the company continues to evaluate reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments  and in some cases may result in the loan being considered impaired 
for collateral dependent loans with deteriorated credit quality  the company estimates the fair value of the underlying collateral of the loans 
these values are discounted using market derived rates of return  with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with the foreclosure and disposition of the collateral 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income  to which carry back refund claims could be made 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
in determining the valuation allowance  the company uses historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carry forward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
these underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
should actual factors and 
table of contents conditions differ materially from those considered by management  the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
if the company is not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions and combinations 
these assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
when these assets are evaluated for impairment  if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to income 
the fair value is based on observable market prices  when practicable 
other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable  including estimated discounted cash flows and market multiples analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
in the event of future changes in fair value  the company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
determination of other than temporary impairment of securities 
the company evaluates debt and equity securities within the company s available for sale and held to maturity portfolios for other than temporary impairment otti  at least quarterly 
if the fair value of a debt security is below the amortized cost basis of the security  otti is required to be recognized if any of the following are met the company intends to sell the security  it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or for debt securities  the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
for all impaired debt securities that the company intends to sell  or more likely than not will be required to sell  the full amount of the depreciation is recognized as otti through earnings 
credit related otti for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings 
noncredit related otti for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
in evaluating its marketable equity securities portfolios for otti  the company considers its intent and ability to hold an equity security to recovery of its cost basis in addition to various other factors  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
any otti on marketable equity securities is recognized immediately through earnings 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those expected by management  the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments 
the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
trading assets  securities available for sale  and derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis  or to establish a loss allowance or write down based on the fair value of impaired assets 
further  the notes to financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and its impact to earnings 
for financial instruments not recorded at fair value  the notes to financial statements disclose the estimate of their fair value 
due to the judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimation process  the estimates could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions

this net discount included premiums and discounts for loans with various prepayment speeds and prepayment volatility  which has contributed to volatility in quarterly net interest income 
additionally  net interest income is charged or credited based on collections of nonaccretable discount as impaired loans are liquidated 
the balance of accretable discount on impaired loans acquired from business combinations totaled million at year end  compared to million at year end the increase included million added for new loans acquired in less million in accretion recorded to income in berkshire continues to take commercial market share from national competitors as a result of the capabilities and responsiveness of the commercial banking teams that it has recruited in recent years

berkshire has also enhanced its small business lending program  with expanded services provided through its branch network 
the million increase in the residential mortgage portfolio to billion included million in balances acquired in the bank mergers 
the million increase excluding these bank mergers primarily represented business development from the eight new eastern massachusetts mortgage lending offices added as a result of the recruitment of the greenpark mortgage team 
berkshire s loan production consisted primarily of conforming fixed rate mortgages to borrowers in and around its markets 
the majority of mortgage production is sold to national institutional secondary market partners and government agencies 
growth in berkshire s mortgage portfolio included mortgages which were purchased from greenpark mortgage prior to its acquisition  together with increased originations by the expanded mortgage banking operation in the strong refinancing market that developed in the second half of the year due to record low interest rates 
growth of the mortgage portfolio was net of million of seasoned mortgages sold during the year as part of the company s overall asset liability management 
additional information about mortgage production is included in the later discussion of non interest income in the results of operations section 
the balance of residential mortgages includes net deferred costs and premiums which increased to million from million in due primarily to premiums paid on purchased greenpark mortgages 
these amounts are amortized into mortgage income and have also contributed to increased quarterly volatility in net interest income due to higher volatility in prepayment speeds 
total consumer loans increased by million to million in including million in balances acquired in bank mergers 
this included million in balances of acquired other consumer loans consisting primarily of indirect auto loans in the beacon portfolio 
berkshire s total auto loan portfolio increased to million at year end  compared to million at the prior year end 
beacon had an established auto lending function that berkshire expects to maintain and may expand in targeted areas 
berkshire s consumer loan outstandings from business development decreased in due to the impact of loan refinancings and the company s concentration on residential mortgage production 
home equity loans increased by million to million in  including million in balances acquired in bank mergers 
the yield on loans was little changed at in the fourth quarter of  compared to in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
the benefit of purchase accounting accretion for loans acquired in bank mergers generally offset the yield compression experienced in the industry due to continuing low interest rates 
the purchase accounting accretion relates to the higher rates assigned to higher risk and impaired acquired loans when they are fair valued at acquisition 
the overall yield on acquired loans was established at for cbt and for beacon based on the initial yields assigned as of the merger dates 
the net accretion in included the new accretion from acquired loans and a decline in the rate of accretion as loans acquired in are reduced 
there is further information about the impact of accretion in the later discussion of net interest income in the results of operations section 
berkshire continues to favor an asset sensitive interest rate risk profile  and seeks to manage the retention of long term fixed rate loans and securities 
the majority of fixed rate residential mortgage production is sold servicing released in the secondary market 
the bank offers back to back interest rate swaps to certain commercial loan customers  which allows the bank to book a variable rate loan while providing the customer with a contract to fix its interest rate 
this 
table of contents allows the company to be more competitive with national financing sources without booking long term  fixed rate assets at current low interest rates  as well as providing a source of fee income 
the bank s loans and securities with contractual repricings over three years increased to of assets from at the start of the year  due primarily to growth in the residential mortgage portfolio 
the impact on portfolio durations is believed to be lower due to the higher rate of prepayments in the current environment 
berkshire utilizes forward starting interest rate swaps to help maintain an overall asset sensitive interest rate risk profile as measured by the sensitivity of net interest income 
asset quality 
berkshire has a chief risk officer and a risk committee of the board which keep a close focus on maintaining strong asset quality  with most focus on the loan portfolio due to the low risk characteristics of the investment portfolio 
this includes setting loan portfolio objectives  maintaining sound underwriting  close portfolio oversight  and careful management of problem assets and potential problem assets 
additionally  merger due diligence is an integral component of maintaining asset quality 
under accounting standards for business combinations  acquired loans are recorded at fair value and are deemed performing regardless of their payment status 
therefore  some overall portfolio measures of asset quality are not comparable between years or among institutions as a result of recent business combinations 
the recorded values of impaired loans acquired in business combinations were generally within estimates made by berkshire during due diligence prior to negotiating the final terms of the merger agreements  and the quality and performance of acquired criticized assets has been within the range of berkshire s expectations 
a general goal is to achieve significant resolutions of impaired loans acquired in bank mergers in the first year following the acquisition date 
year end non performing assets were little changed at million in compared to million in they declined to of total assets at year end due primarily to the asset growth from acquisitions 
loans which became non performing during the year totaled million in  compared to million in the prior year 
the impact of new non performing assets was mostly offset by resolutions including upgrades  collections  and charge offs 
increased non performing commercial business loans were mostly offset by lower non performing commercial real estate loans 
the ten largest non performing loans totaled million and were generally well secured  with million in impairment reserves as of year end 
the largest non performing asset at year end was approximately million 
for loans from business activities  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at year end  compared to at the start of the year 
loans classified as performing troubled debt restructurings increased to million from million during due to a limited number of commercial credits 
there were no loans which were restructured in that subsequently defaulted during the year 
foreclosed real estate remained negligible at year end  totaling million 
accruing loans over days past due measured of total loans at year end  compared to at the start of the year 
these loans totaled million at year end  including million in loans acquired in business combinations which are recorded as accruing under accounting standards for business combinations 
loans delinquent days increased to of total loans from due to delinquent loans acquired in bank mergers 
net loan charge offs were of average loans in total net charge offs were million in  compared to million in loans acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value  including the impact of estimated credit losses 
therefore  net charge offs from acquired loans contributed only million to total net charge offs in based on an average of period end balances  net charge offs in measured approximately of average loans excluding loans acquired in business combinations 
the credit risk profile of the company s loan portfolio is described in the loans note in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s risk management process focuses primary attention on loans with higher than normal risk  which includes loans rated special mention and classified substandard and lower 
these loans are referred to as 
table of contents criticized loans  and criticized assets are the total of criticized loans and foreclosed real estate 
criticized assets increased as a result of the business combinations in criticized assets totaled million of total assets at year end  compared to million of total assets at the start of the year 
the company views its potential problem loans as those loans from business activities which are rated as classified and continue to accrue interest 
these loans have a possibility of loss if weaknesses are not corrected 
classified loans acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value and are classified as performing at the time of acquisition and therefore are not generally viewed as potential problem loans 
potential problem loans totaled million at year end compared to million at the prior year end 
the ten largest potential problem loans totaled million at year end  with the largest such loan totaling million 
all of these ten loans were viewed by the company as stable or improving 
the company s evaluation of its credit risk profile also compares the amount of classified assets to the total of the bank s tier capital plus the loan loss allowance 
this ratio was at year end  and was unchanged from the prior year end 
loan loss allowance 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate 
the company s methodologies for determining the loan loss allowance are discussed in item of this report and item includes further information about the accounting policy for the loan loss allowance and the company s accounting for the allowance in the consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses appropriate to cover probable losses which can be reasonably estimated and which are inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
under accounting standards for business combinations  acquired loans are recorded at fair value with no loan loss allowance on the date of acquisition 
the fair value of acquired loans includes the impact of estimated loan losses for the life of the portfolio  including factors which are not probable or inherent as of the acquisition date  and including subjective assessments of risk 
a loan loss allowance is recorded by the company for the emergence of new probable and estimable losses relating to acquired loans which were not impaired as of the acquisition date 
because of the accounting for acquired loans  some measures of the loan loss allowance are not comparable to periods prior to the acquisition date or to other financial institutions 
the total amount of the loan loss allowance was million at year end  compared to million at the start of the year 
the increase was due to growth in general reserves on acquired loans to million from million 
this reflected a general increase in environmental risk for loans acquired in based on inherent losses which have become probable and estimable in addition to those which were projected at acquisition 
for loans from business activities  the related year end allowance was unchanged from year to year  with a million increase in impaired loan reserves offset by an identical decrease in general pool reserves 
loans from business activities increased in  and as a result the related year end allowance decreased to of these loans from at the beginning of the year 
the reduction in coverage of these balances is consistent with the increased proportion of lower risk residential mortgages  the gradual shift of commercial balances from real estate loans to lower risk loans secured by business operating assets  and the decline in potential problem loans 
the decrease in this ratio is consistent with the company s ongoing plan to strengthen the portfolio s risk metrics and gradually reduce the percentage of the portfolio with inherent losses that are probable and estimable 
the year end allowance provided x coverage of net charge offs and x coverage of year end non accrual loans 
the specific reserve for loans from business activities individually evaluated for impairment measured of the related loan balances  demonstrating the general strength of collateral support for impaired commercial loans 
other assets 
most categories of assets increased due to the company s expanded operations including business combinations 
loans held for sale increased as a result of berkshire s expanded mortgage production 
this increase was due to the expansion of the mortgage banking operations and the record mortgage production due to heightened refinancing 
table of contents demand resulting from record low interest rates 
designated mortgage originations are held for sale to longstanding secondary market relationships and are hedged in order to minimize interest rate risk from the time that interest rates are initially locked during the application process 
for loans held for sale  berkshire enters into mandatory delivery or best efforts sale contracts with institutional secondary market purchasers 
goodwill increased due to the business combinations 
goodwill is the difference between the fair value of consideration paid for these acquisitions and the fair value of net assets and liabilities acquired 
the balance of goodwill includes goodwill related to prior acquisitions 
goodwill is analyzed annually for impairment in accordance with accounting standards  and there was no impairment charge recognized based on the most recent analysis in in the current market environment  there was no significant intangible asset recorded for the fair value of core deposits acquired

the fourth quarter return on equity was  and measured before the net merger and nonrecurring items 
the return on equity was in before the company undertook most of its recent growth initiatives 
the company views its return on equity before net merger and nonrecurring items as indicative of its underlying profitability from operations 
the run rate of quarterly operating profitability has more than doubled over the past two years as a result of berkshire s growth initiatives including business development  team recruitment  and accretive acquisitions 
over that time  the company has increased the tangible book value of its shares while also paying a steady and increasing stock dividend

conversion expenses were primarily related to the core systems conversion which is a long term investment in the company s operating infrastructure 
these investments are intended to be accretive to return on equity and to contribute to long term earnings growth and franchise value

this included a full year s benefit from acquisitions together with a partial year benefit from acquisitions 
the net interest margin increased to in from in the margin benefited from the addition of acquired bank balances 
based on fair value analyses performed as of the acquisition date  the net interest margin of acquired beacon accounts was estimated at approximately 
this primarily reflected the higher yield assigned to acquired higher risk and impaired loans  including recording all impaired loans as accruing in accordance with accounting principles 
additionally  the yields assigned to acquired time deposits and borrowings reflected current low interest rates and remaining maturities 
berkshire believes that its net interest margin from business activities was declining during this reflects the impact of asset repricings in the ongoing low interest rate environment  while deposit liability cost reductions were limited by competitive market conditions and the near zero level of many short term market interest rates 
the significant loan growth in the last two years has resulted in a balance of accretable yield on acquired loans totaling million  including million related to acquired impaired loans 
growth in residential mortgages has contributed to an increase in deferred loan costs and premiums totaling million

the net amount of purchase accounting loan accretion credited to net interest income was million in  compared to million in the net amount of loan premium and cost amortization charged against net interest income was million in  compared to million in the prior year 
the growth in accretable yield and deferred costs have led to greater volatility in the quarterly net interest margin due to the uneven impacts of loan prepayments from quarter to quarter

the cost of deposits decreased from in to in  and declined to in the fourth quarter of the year 
this reflected the reductions in rates paid on all major categories of deposits  reducing the cost of interest bearing deposits by 
lower deposit costs also reflected the strong growth rate in non interest bearing demand deposits during the year 
the company believes that it has additional potential opportunities to lower deposit costs while continuing to increase its balances 
the cost of borrowings trended down through the third quarter of and then increased to in the last quarter of the year 
this was due to the million in subordinated debt financing issued for the beacon acquisition at the end of the third quarter with a coupon 
the company adheres to disciplines in pricing its assets and liabilities in order to maintain an appropriate net interest margin and return on equity  while also achieving its asset liability objectives 
the company strives to maintain a modestly asset sensitive interest rate risk profile so that long term earnings will benefit when interest rates increase from the very low levels that have existed in the most recent years 
the current low level of interest rates is generally leading to tighter interest margins in the banking industry 
the company therefore plans to continue to adjust its pricing and to pursue volume growth in conjunction with its long term net interest margin objectives

due to changes in its revenue mix and the impact of merger related  conversion and non recurring items  the company relies on non gaap measures to assess the efficiency of its operations 
the company believes that its efficiency is improving in accordance with its objectives  as a product of the positive operating leverage and resulting in benefits to its measures of return on equity which were previously discussed

income tax expense on continuing operations 
the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was in  compared to in the increase in rate is primarily due to the higher level of pretax income and the lower proportionate benefit of tax advantaged income from investments and bank owned life insurance

excluding these items  non interest expense increased by million 
berkshire estimated that by year end  it had achieved its targeted recurring non interest expense savings of related to rome operations and related to legacy operations 
at the beginning of the second quarter  the fdic implemented new banking industry deposit insurance assessment rates and formulas 
this change reduced fdic insurance expense  which measured of average deposits in  compared to in expense of other real estate owned increased in primarily due to write downs of foreclosed real estate 
amortization of intangible assets increased due primarily to the core deposit intangibles recorded for the bank acquisitions 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased by million to million in compared to the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was in compared to in results in and prior years included the impact of an accounting error correction related to the tax credit limited partnerships which was not material to the financial statements 
this tax credit  which equated to a effective credit to the effective tax rate  was previously reported as a component of non interest income 
the decrease in also reflected the benefit of non taxable gains on the rome and legacy acquisitions 
income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was thousand in discontinued operations related to branches held for divestiture in the second half of four of these branches were divested in the fourth quarter and the remaining four were divested in january the divestiture in resulted in a million pre tax gain 
the tax rate on discontinued operations was due to the non deductibility of goodwill for income tax purposes in determining the taxable gain on divestiture 
primarily as a result of this higher tax rate on discontinued operations  the effective tax rate on total continuing and discontinued operations increased to in from in the prior year 
results of segment and parent operations 
results in the banking segment generally followed the levels and trends of consolidated results  which have been previously discussed 
in the insurance segment  revenues decreased by due to ongoing soft pricing conditions and reduced contingency fees in the industry 
expenses decreased by  and as a result  insurance segment net income increased by 
the parent s net interest income included dividends from the insurance segment 
parent non interest expense increased due primarily to professional fees related to the bank acquisitions 
most of the parent s revenues are non taxable revenues from subsidiaries  and the parent therefore receives a tax benefit related to the taxable loss generated by its expenses 
total comprehensive income 
the company recorded comprehensive income of million due primarily to million in net income discussed previously 
comprehensive income in was million  including net income of million which was partially offset by an other comprehensive loss relating to unrealized losses on derivatives instruments due to ongoing low interest rates 

table of contents liquidity and cash flows liquidity is the ability to meet cash needs at all times with available cash or by conversion of other assets to cash at a reasonable price and in a timely manner 
at year end  the parent company had million in cash and equivalents  compared to million at the start of the year 
this cash was held on deposit in the bank 
the primary ongoing source of funding for the parent company is dividend payments from the bank and from berkshire insurance group 
these subsidiaries paid million in dividends to the parent in additional potential sources of liquidity are proceeds from borrowings and capital offerings  and from stock option exercises 
in  the company issued million in subordinated notes to fund merger cash consideration 
the company also arranged a million unsecured line of credit for working capital purposes  this line was fully utilized at year end 
the main uses of liquidity are the payment of common stockholder dividends  routine operating expenses  debt service on outstanding borrowings and debentures  purchases of treasury stock  and business acquisitions 
the company generally expects to maintain cash on hand equivalent to normal cash uses  including common stock dividends  for at least a one year period 
sources and uses of cash at the parent are reported in the condensed financial statements of the parent company included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the bank as discussed in the stockholders equity note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of year end  the statutory limit on future dividend payments by the bank totaled million 
this amount is based on retained earnings of the bank and is expected to be supplemented by future bank earnings in accordance with the statutory formula 
the bank s primary source of liquidity is customer deposits and the main use of liquidity is the funding of loans and lending commitments 
additional routine sources are borrowings  repayments of loans and investment securities  and the sale and repayments of investment securities 
in  the primary uses of funds were loan growth and an increase in mortgage loans held for sale 
the primary sources of funds were deposit growth and borrowings 
the bank closely monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
sources of borrowings include advances from the fhlbb and borrowings at the federal reserve bank of boston 
as of year end  based on its arrangements and collateral amounts  the bank had potential borrowing capacity totaling million with the federal home loan bank of boston 
the bank is also expanding its relationships with correspondent banks and securities firms to maintain availability for overnight borrowings and repurchase agreements 
the bank utilizes the mortgage secondary market as a source of funds for residential mortgages which are sold into that market 
secondary market counterparties include federal mortgage agencies and national financial institutions 
the bank also utilizes national bank counterparties for derivative instruments that it uses in conjunction with its borrowing and mortgage banking activities 
in all three of the most recent years  deposit growth has exceeded loan growth 
in and  excess funds from deposit growth were used to pay down borrowings 
in  the company decided to take advantage of capital market conditions by utilizing fixed rate subordinated debt rather than common equity for merger consideration 
the company also utilized overnight funds to support its expanded mortgage banking operations 
as a result  the use of borrowings increased in one general measure of liquidity is the loan deposit ratio  which was affected by the activities described above  together with the impact of financial instruments acquired in business combinations 
this ratio stood at at year end  compared to at the start of the year and indicated a favorable but slightly less liquid position as a result of the year s events 
for the industry  a key challenge has been growth in liquidity as savings activities in the economy have outpaced investment activities 
banks have had to carry more of their deposit funds in liquid cash and securities  rather than in loans 
due to its acquisition activities  the company has been able to build its balance of loans and loans held for sale in addition to the volume generated from loan operations 
the company believes that it is continuing to improve its access to sources of liquidity and capital 
in  this included major expansions in secondary market and loan sales outlets along with financial derivatives sources  expansion of fed funds sources  continued de novo branch expansion  the initiation of a parent company line of credit  the private 
table of contents placement of institutional subordinated debt which qualifies as regulatory capital  and the higher volume of issued and outstanding common stock 
through its business combinations  berkshire now has branches in new geographic markets which are a potential source of new deposit funding in the future 
the greatest sources of uncertainty affecting liquidity are deposit withdrawals and usage of loan commitments  which are influenced by interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
due to the unusual and prolonged low interest rate environment  there is uncertainty about the behavior of deposits if interest rates increase at some future time as anticipated 
the company believes that its market positioning and relationship focus will generally enhance the stability of its deposits  and it also models various scenarios for the purpose of contingency liquidity planning 
the company has had success in building commercial deposits  including large balances from certain sources 
the company monitors its deposit concentrations to manage the impact of possible changes in these sources 
at the end of  the unlimited fdic insurance on bank transaction account balances terminated as scheduled under statute 
the company does not anticipate that there will be a significant impact from this change 
additionally  the bank offers insurance on all deposit balances as a result of the combination of fdic insurance and the massachusetts depositors insurance fund 
due to its growth  the bank may need to consider alternatives to its use of this supplementary insurance and its liquidity planning as expanded as a result 
the bank relies on competitive rates  customer service  and long standing relationships with customers to manage deposit and loan liquidity 
based on its historical experience  management believes that it has adequately provided for deposit and loan liquidity needs 
both liquidity and capital resources are managed according to policies approved by the board of directors and executive management and the board reviews liquidity metrics and contingency plans on a regular basis 
capital resources the bank must satisfy various regulatory capital requirements 
regulatory capital requirements are discussed in the regulation and supervision section of item  in the risk factors discussion  and in the stockholders equity note to the consolidated financial statements 
please also see management s discussion of financial condition for additional information about liquidity and capital at year end in november   the company renewed a universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to million in securities  including debt securities  common stock  or preferred stock 
the company did not issue any securities under the previous registration  and does not have any specific plans for issuances under the current registration 
berkshire views its earnings and related internal capital generation as a primary source of capital to support dividends and growth of the franchise 
additionally  the company generally uses the issuance of common stock as the primary source of consideration for bank acquisitions  and such acquisitions may result in net increases or decreases in its capital ratios 
in  the bank acquisitions resulted in a net increase in the company s capital ratios due to the use of subordinated debt to achieve a more favorable blended cost of capital 
berkshire s long term objective is to generate a double digit annual return on equity  and the company evaluates lending  investment  and acquisition decisions with this objective as a benchmark 
in the fourth quarter of  berkshire s board of directors established a new capital committee  which is responsible for assisting the board in planning for future capital needs and for ensuring compliance with regulations pertaining to capital structure and levels 
in  berkshire increased its outstanding shares by from million to million due to the issuance of merger consideration 
the company believes that this provides further liquidity and visibility to its common stock  and that the market for its stock is an additional capital resource over the long run 
additionally  the company continues to monitor market conditions for tier two regulatory capital such as preferred stock or subordinated debt  which are additional potential future capital resources to the company and or the bank

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  berkshire engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in the company s financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
a further presentation of the company s off balance sheet arrangements is presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the above discussion relating to payments due under contractual obligations 
information about derivative financial instruments and hedging activities is reported in the related note to the consolidated financial statements  and was included in management s discussion of changes in financial condition 
fair value measurements the most significant fair value measurements recorded by the company are those related to assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations 
these measurements are discussed further in the mergers and acquisitions note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company makes further measurements of fair value of certain assets and liabilities  as described in the related note in the financial statements 
recurring fair values of financial instruments primarily relate to securities and derivative instruments 
a valuation hierarchy is utilized based on generally accepted accounting principles 
measurements based on level inputs rely the most on subjective management judgments 
level recurring measurements relate primarily to the million fair value of a local tax advantaged economic development bond issued to a berkshire county non profit  which is classified as a trading security 
changes in the fair value of this security are recorded in non interest income  as are offsetting changes in the accompanying interest rate swap 
non recurring fair value measurements primarily relate to securities held to maturity  restricted equity securities  impaired loans  and goodwill and other 
table of contents intangibles 
when measurement is required  these measures are generally based on level inputs 
non recurring fair values of financial instruments relate primarily to impairment analysis of economic development bonds recorded as held to maturity  restricted equity securities  and loans 
fair value measurements of non financial assets and liabilities primarily relate to impairment analyses of intangibles and goodwill 
the company performed an impairment analysis of its goodwill in and and determined that there was no impairment 
the company also provides a summary of estimated fair values of financial instruments at each quarter end 
the category of financial assets with the most significant difference between carrying value and fair value is the net loan category  which is valued based entirely on level analysis 
the fair value of loans is estimated to be at a million premium to carrying value at year end  compared to a premium at year end and a premium at year end the premium value of loans has narrowed based on higher prepayment speeds and lower replacement yields despite the benefit of ongoing improvement in the credit profile of the portfolio 
additionally  as the portfolio had grown due to the acquisition of loans in business combinations which are recorded at fair value  the fair value premium related to loans recorded at cost has declined as a percentage of the whole portfolio 
the excess fair value of deposits over carrying amount increased modestly due to the impact of lower market interest rates despite continuing decreases in the cost of time deposits 
as a result of the lower loan premium and higher deposit value  there was a decline in the net economic value of equity related to those instruments  based solely on the measures used for the purpose of this analysis 
this change reflects the mounting pressure on net interest margins in the industry  but does not take into account the non interest income generated by these customer relationships or the long term intangible value of the company s franchise in its markets 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
interest rates may be affected by inflation  but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary 
a sudden change in inflation or expectations about inflation  with a related change in interest rates  would have a significant impact on our operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the company seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest income and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
the company maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
this committee meets monthly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the risk management committee and board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
the company has managed interest rate risk by emphasizing assets with shorter term repricing durations  periodically selling long term fixed rate assets  promoting low cost core deposits  and using fhlbb advances to structure its liability repricing durations 
the company also uses interest rate swaps in order to enhance its interest rate risk position and manage its balance sheet 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income that would result from both an instantaneous or ramped change in market interest rates assuming a parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
the chart below shows the analysis of a ramped change 
loans  deposits and borrowings were expected to reprice at the repricing or maturity date 
the company uses prepayment guidelines set forth by market sources as well as company generated data where applicable 
cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested based on current operating conditions and strategies 
other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant 
no material changes have been made to the methodologies used in the model 

table of contents item a table qualitative aspects of market risk change in interest rates basis months months points rate ramp change change change change in thousands at december  at december  at year end  the table above shows that berkshire has maintained a moderately asset sensitive interest rate risk profile  although one that is somewhat less so than twelve months earlier 
with this profile  net interest income will increase if interest rates rise and net interest income will decline if they fall assuming a parallel shift in the yield curve and unchanged market spreads to treasuries for various categories of assets and liabilities 
short term us treasury rates are currently near zero and the federal reserve bank has indicated an expectation that they will be maintained at these levels through most of the next several years 
the company views it as unlikely that short term rates will decrease significantly from current levels 
the additions of cbt and beacon  and the expansion of residential mortgage operations  increased interest bearing assets and liabilities  and moderately reduced modeled interest rate sensitivity of net interest income 
based on berkshire s review of both cbt s and beacon s balance sheet and balance sheet changes subsequent to the merger  berkshire modeled that the interest rate risk of both operations was modestly liability sensitive 
after integrating these two banks and restructuring the borrowings and securities  berkshire estimates that there has been a downward shift in its asset sensitivity after completing these mergers  but that the company overall maintains its asset sensitive posture 
this shift includes the impact of the company s lending activities  including growth in the fixed rate residential mortgage portfolio 
berkshire maintained its asset sensitive profile and was able to do so while integrating two liability sensitive institutions in part by entering into million of forward starting interest rate swaps in and issuing a million subordinated debt issue that has a fixed cost for the first years of its term 
in  million of the company s pool of forward starting interest rate swaps becomes effective 
the company also estimates the sensitivity of the economic value of its equity to interest rate shocks 
the company believes that it is a strategic strength to avoid excess long term earnings at risk when interest rates rise in the future  as anticipated 
at year end  the company estimated that the economic value of equity would decrease by approximately in the event of a basis point upward interest rate shock  which was well within the company s policy limits 
the decrease reflects the impact of fixed rate assets on medium and long term modeled net income if interest rates increase 
this estimate is subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties and is not intended as a projection of future operating results 
the company s modeling of interest rate risk focuses on net interest income 
the company s expansion has increased its reliance on fee income sources which are also affected by changes in interest rates 
mortgage banking operations 
table of contents were expanded significantly in mortgage banking revenues and earnings can be significantly affected by interest rate changes which affect mortgage demand  particularly for refinancings  as well as pricing margins 
other fee income sources that may be sensitive to the level and trend of interest rates include the company s sales of interest rate swaps and commercial cash management services which are compensated with demand deposit balances 
the company s net income is increasingly sensitive to these changes in non interest income  in addition to interest income changes 
the company is evaluating enhancements to its risk management to develop additional measures  standards  and options for managing this risk 
the market is expected to continue to experience some general yield compression if short term rates remain near zero for the next three years and if international and other economic events continue to hold down long term us interest rates 
the company expects that interest rates will increase over the medium term from currently suppressed levels and that there is the potential for rate spikes based on economic or financial shocks in the domestic and global markets 
berkshire continues to target ongoing loan growth as it pursues its market share acquisition strategies  and this growth will include a mix of variable and fixed rate loans 
the company s long term target is to flexibly balance its growth  deposit funding  net interest margin  and interest rate risk management as it pursues its goals of expanding its footprint  increasing its market share  and improving its profitability 
the company believes that  as a result of its expansion  it has more revenue and cost levers available to deal with the challenges of its operating environment and to achieve its goals 
berkshire has a number of business strategies to increase net interest income despite the potential for tighter market yields 
these include changes in volumes and mix of interest bearing assets and liabilities  some of which are discussed above 
the company also evaluates its pricing strategies on an ongoing basis  and considers its investment  borrowings  and derivatives strategies in managing its income and risk profile 
due to the limitations and uncertainties relating to model assumptions  the modeled computations should not be relied on as projections of income 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
in the unusual current economic and financial circumstances in the national markets  modeling assumptions depend significantly on subjective judgment which cannot be readily verified by historic data 
additionally  due to the company s expansion into new markets  it has more revenues dependent on customer behaviors in products and markets where it has less historic background for its modeling assumptions 
the most significant modeling assumption relates to expectations for the interest sensitivity of non maturity deposit accounts in a rising rate environment 
the model assumes that deposit rate sensitivity will be a percentage of the market interest rate change 
the rate sensitivity depends on the underlying amount of market rate change and the type of deposit account 
the percentage rate movements are as follows now accounts ranging between and  money market accounts ranging between and  and savings accounts ranging between and 
one of the significant limitations of the simulation is that it assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve 
actual interest rate risks are often more complex than this scenario 
due to the extraordinary fiscal and monetary interventions in the domestic and international markets since  there is elevated uncertainty about future market conditions and about customer demand and behaviors in the event of future interest rate changes 
assumption changes in were based on a review of past performance and future expectations and were not viewed as material 
of note  in  regulations were changed to allow the payment of interest on business demand deposit balances 
this change has not significantly impacted the company s operations or interest rate risk environment  but future events could increase risk as a result of this change 
additionally  at the end of  the fdic terminated its unlimited insurance coverage for transaction account balances 
further  as it grows  the company is evaluating alternative structures for its supplemental deposit protection offerings 
changes in deposit protection can result in additional sensitivity to the interest rate structure and demand for the company s deposit products  and this sensitivity could increase when interest rates rise above the current low levels
