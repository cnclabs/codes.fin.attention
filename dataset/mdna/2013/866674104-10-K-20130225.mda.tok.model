item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k 
executive summary we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit 
we own  operate  and develop manufactured housing and rv communities concentrated in the midwestern  southern  and southeastern united states 
as of december   we owned and operated a portfolio of developed properties located in states  including manufactured housing communities  rv communities  and properties containing both manufactured housing and rv sites 
we are have been in the business of acquiring  operating  developing and expanding manufactured housing and rv communities since we lease individual sites with utility access for placement of manufactured homes and rvs to our customers 
we are also engaged through shs in the marketing  selling  and leasing of new and pre owned homes to current and future residents in our communities 
the operations of shs support and enhance our occupancy levels  property performance  and cash flows 
property operations portfolio information years ended december  occupancy total portfolio mh and perm rv occupancy same site mh and perm rv funds from operations excluding certain items noi total portfolio noi same site homes sold number of occupied rental homes refer to item  supplemental measures  for information regarding the presentation of the noi financial measure and funds from operations excluding certain items financial measure 
our same site properties continue to achieve revenue and occupancy increases which drive continued noi growth 
home sales are at their historical high and we expect to continue to increase the number of homes sold in our portfolio 
acquisition activity we acquired seven manufactured housing communities comprised of  developed sites  five rv communities comprised of  developed sites  and two communities with both manufactured housing and rv sites comprised of  developed sites for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of approximately million of assumed debt encumbering six of the acquired properties 
besides the noted activity in  we acquired communities  or million of properties  net of assumed debt in we continue to experience an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities and will seek to enhance the growth of the company through continued selective acquisitions 
development activity we expanded sites at three properties in we continue to expand our properties and expect to construct approximately  to  additional sites in  located primarily in texas and colorado which have current occupancies in excess of percent 
sun communities  inc 
capital activity we closed two underwritten registered public offerings totaling million shares of common stock with net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering related expenses 
we closed an underwritten registered public offering of million shares of series a preferred stock with net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering related expenses 
proceeds from capital raises allowed for not only the acquisition of properties but also  strengthening our balance sheet by taking measured steps to de lever our assets 
we have improved our leverage and coverage ratios and may opportunistically access capital markets to improve liquidity and further improve credit metrics in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimate and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment property investment property is recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used for impairment quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
circumstances that may prompt a test of recoverability may include a significant decrease in the anticipated market price  an adverse change to the extent or manner in which an asset may be used or in its physical condition or other such events that may significantly change the value of the long lived asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when a long lived asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds estimated fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our long lived assets based on future cash flows and any potential disposition proceeds for a given asset 
forecasting cash flows requires management to make estimates and assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period  rental rates  occupancy  development and operating expenses during the holding period  as well as disposition proceeds 
management uses its best judgment when developing these estimates and assumptions  but the development of the projected future cash flows is based on subjective variables 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist  and significant adverse changes in national  regional  or local market conditions or trends may cause us to change the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
the results of an impairment analysis could be material to our financial statements 
capitalized costs we capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with the development  redevelopment  capital enhancement and leasing of our properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
the amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred 
renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete 
costs incurred to renovate repossessed homes for our rental program are capitalized and costs incurred to refurbish the homes at turnover and repair the homes while occupied are expensed 
certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period based on the anticipated term of occupancy of a resident 
costs associated with implementing our computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware 
costs incurred to obtain new financing are capitalized and amortized over the terms of the related loan agreement using the straight line method which approximates the effective interest method 
sun communities  inc 
notes and other receivables we provide financing to purchasers of manufactured homes generally located in our communities 
the notes are collateralized by the underlying manufactured home sold 
notes receivable include both installment loans retained by the company as well as transferred loans that have not met the requirements for sale accounting which are presented herein as collateralized receivables see note to our financial statements for additional information 
for purposes of accounting policy  all notes receivable are considered one homogeneous segment  as the notes are typically underwritten using the same requirements and terms 
notes receivable are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balance adjusted for an allowance for loan loss 
interest income is accrued based upon the unpaid principal balance of the loans 
past due status of our notes receivable is determined based upon the contractual terms of the note 
when a note receivable becomes days delinquent  we stop accruing interest on the note receivable 
the interest on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
loans on a nonaccrual status were immaterial at december  and the ability to collect our notes receivable is measured based on current and historical information and events 
we consider numerous factors including length of delinquency  estimated costs to lease or sell  and repossession history 
our experience supports a high recovery rate for notes receivable  however there is some degree of uncertainty about the recoverability of our investment in these notes receivable 
we are generally able to recover our recorded investment in uncollectible notes receivable by repossessing the homes on the notes retained by us and repurchasing the homes on the collateralized receivables  and subsequently selling or leasing these homes to potential residents in our communities 
we have established a loan loss reserve based on our estimated unrecoverable costs associated with repossessed repurchased homes 
we estimate our unrecoverable costs to be the repurchase price of the home collateralizing the note receivable plus repair and remarketing costs in excess of the estimated selling price of the home being repossessed 
a historical average of this excess cost is calculated based on prior repossessions repurchases and is applied to our estimated annual future repossessions to create the allowance for both installment and collateralized notes receivable 
see note to our financial statements for additional information 
we evaluate the collectability of a loan based on our ability to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we generally see that if the obligor is delinquent on the loan they are also delinquent on site rent 
if the scheduled payment is delinquent more than five to seven days  dependent on state law  we begin the repossession and eviction process simultaneously 
this process generally takes to days  due to the short time frame from delinquent loan to repossession we do not evaluate the notes receivables for impairments 
no loans were considered impaired as of december  and we evaluate the credit quality of our notes receivable at the inception of the receivable 
we consider the following factors in order to determine the credit quality of the applicant rental payment history  home debt to income ratio  total debt to income ratio  length of employment  previous landlord references  and fico scores 
other receivables are generally comprised of amounts due from residents for rent and related charges  home sale proceeds receivable from sales near year end and various other miscellaneous receivables 
accounts receivable from residents are typically due within days and stated at amounts due from residents net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we evaluate the recoverability of our receivables whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan and lease agreements 
receivables related to community rents are reserved when we believe that collection is less than probable  which is generally after a resident balance reaches to days past due 
investment in affiliates investments in affiliates in which we do not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest  but can exercise significant influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the carrying value of our investment is adjusted for our proportionate share of the affiliate s net income or loss and reduced by distributions received 
we review the carrying value of our investment in affiliates for other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
financial condition  operational performance  and other economic trends are some of the factors we consider when we evaluate the existence of impairment indicators 
when we have a carrying value of zero for our investment  we suspend the equity method of accounting until such time that the affiliate s net income equals or exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the time in which the equity method of accounting was suspended

revenue recognition rental income attributable to site and home leases is recorded on a straight line basis when earned from tenants 
leases entered into by tenants are generally for one year terms but may range from month to month to two years and are renewable by mutual agreement from us and the resident  or in some cases  as provided by state statute 
revenue from the sale of manufactured homes is recognized upon transfer of title at the closing of the sales transaction 
interest income on notes receivable is recorded on a level yield basis over the life of the notes 
we report certain taxes collected from the resident and remitted to taxing authorities in revenue 
these taxes include certain florida property and fire taxes 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are years for land improvements and buildings  years for rental homes  seven to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment  and seven years for intangible assets 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we have three derivative contracts consisting of one interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of million  and two interest rate cap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million as of december  we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
for those hedges that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  we adjust our balance sheet on a quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of our derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings or comprehensive income loss  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of these hedges are immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged 
the effective portion of these hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we use standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit as defined under section c of the code 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  at least ninety five percent of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level if we distribute at least ninety percent of our reit ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
from the time we started paying dividends  we have distributed greater than of our taxable income to our shareholders and intend to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we remain subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
we are subject to certain state taxes that are considered income taxes and have certain subsidiaries that are taxed as regular corporations 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements and net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is established if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu  reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements asu which amends asc topic  transfers and servicing 
the updated guidance in asc topic removes from the assessment of effective control the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms  even in the event of default by the transferee  and the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion 
the updated guidance in asc topic is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after december  early adoption was not permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu which amends asc topic  fair value measurement 
the updated guidance in asc topic changes the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and sun communities  inc 
for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the updated guidance in asc topic is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early adoption was not permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
supplemental measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with gaap  we have provided information regarding net operating income noi in the following tables 
noi is derived from revenues minus property operating and maintenance expenses and real estate taxes 
we use noi as the primary basis to evaluate the performance of our operations 
a reconciliation of noi to net income loss attributable to sun communities  inc is included in results of operations below 
we believe that noi is helpful to investors and analysts as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment  and provides a method of comparing property performance over time 
we use noi as a key management tool when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and or groups of properties 
the principal limitation of noi is that it excludes depreciation  amortization  interest expense  and non property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses  all of which are significant costs  and therefore  noi is a measure of the operating performance of our properties rather than of the company overall 
we believe that these costs included in net income loss often have no effect on the market value of our property and therefore limit its use as a performance measure 
in addition  such expenses are often incurred at a parent company level and therefore are not necessarily linked to the performance of a real estate asset 
noi should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of our financial performance  or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
noi  as determined and presented by us  may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we also provide information regarding funds from operations ffo 
we consider ffo an appropriate supplemental measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
under the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  ffo represents net income  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap  and gain loss on sales of depreciable property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management also uses ffo excluding certain items  a non gaap financial measure  which excludes certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of our core business 
we believe that this provides investors with another financial measure of our operating performance that is more comparable when evaluating period over period results 
a discussion of ffo  ffo excluding certain items  a reconciliation of ffo to net income loss  and ffo to ffo excluding certain items are included in the presentation of ffo in results of operations following the comparison of the years ended december  and sun communities  inc 
results of operations we report operating results under two segments real property operations and home sales and rentals 
the real property operations segment owns  operates  and develops manufactured housing communities and rv communities concentrated in the midwestern  southern  and southeastern united states and is in the business of acquiring  operating  and expanding manufactured housing and rv communities 
the home sales and rentals segment offers manufactured home sales and leasing services to tenants and prospective tenants of our communities 
we evaluate segment operating performance based on noi and gross profit 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements  except for the use of noi 
we may allocate certain common costs  primarily corporate functions  between the segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
these allocated costs include expenses for shared services such as information technology  finance  communications  legal  and human resources 
we do not allocate interest expense and certain other corporate costs not directly associated with the segments noi and gross profit

ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income loss computed in accordance gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
due to the variety among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  we believe excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  impairment and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  provides a better indicator of our operating performance 
ffo is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  and operating costs  providing perspective not readily apparent from net income loss 
management believes that the use of ffo has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management  the investment community  and banking institutions routinely use ffo  together with other measures  to measure operating performance in our industry 
further  management uses ffo for planning and forecasting future periods 
because ffo excludes significant economic components of net income loss including depreciation and amortization  ffo should be used as an adjunct to net income loss and not as an alternative to net income loss 
the principal limitation of ffo is that it does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income loss as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not intended as a measure of a reit s ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements  nor as a measure of working capital 
ffo only provides investors with an additional performance measure 
ffo is compiled in accordance with its interpretation of standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently

liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity demands have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  distributions to our stockholders and the unitholders of the operating partnership  capital improvements of properties  the purchase of new and pre owned homes  property acquisitions  development and expansion of properties  and debt repayment 
subject to market conditions  we intend to continue to look for opportunities to expand our development pipeline and acquire existing communities 
we also intend to continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals  which are generating positive cash flows from operations  maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios  and controlling overhead costs 
we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through available cash balances  cash flows generated from operations  draws on our secured credit facility  and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 
we completed seven acquisitions in in which we acquired properties in total  seven manufactured housing communities  five rv communities and two communities containing both manufactured housing and rv communities 
see note to our financial statements for details on the acquisitions and note to our financial statements for related debt transactions 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria for acquisition 
should additional investment opportunities arise in  we intend to finance the acquisitions through secured financing  draws on our credit facilities  the assumption of existing debt on the properties and the issuance of certain equity securities 
during the year ended december   we have invested million in the acquisition of homes intended for the rental program net of proceeds from third party financing from homes sales 
expenditures for will be dependent upon the condition of the markets for repossessions and new home sales  as well as rental homes 
we finance new home purchases with a million floor plan facility 
our ability to purchase homes for sale or rent may be limited by cash received from third party financing of our home sales  available floor plan financing and working capital available on our secured lines of credit 
our cash flow activities are summarized as follows in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities cash and cash equivalents increased by million from million as of december   to million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations may be adversely impacted by  among other things a the market and economic conditions in our current markets generally  and specifically in metropolitan areas of our current markets  b lower occupancy and rental rates of our properties  c increased operating costs  such as wage and benefit costs  insurance premiums  real estate taxes and utilities  that cannot be passed on to our tenants  d decreased sales of manufactured homes and e current volatility in economic conditions and the financial markets 
see risk factors in our annual report 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the difference is primarily due to increased acquisitions of million see note to our financial statements  a decrease in proceeds from the disposition of homes  assets and land of million  an increase in notes receivable of million  and increased investment in property of million  largely due to homes purchased for the rental program primarily in the acquired communities and expansion projects  offset by an increase in proceeds from affiliate dividend distribution of million 
sun communities  inc 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to of million for the year ended december  the difference is due to increased net proceeds received from the issuance of additional shares of million  increased proceeds from issuance of other debt net of repayments on other debt of million and decreased payments of deferred financing costs of million  partially offset by decreased net borrowings on the line of credit of million  increased distributions to our stockholders and op unitholders of million and decreased net proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
we continually evaluate our debt maturities  and  based on management current assessment  believe we have viable financing and refinancing alternatives that will not materially adversely impact our expected financial results 
the credit environment has slowly improved and we continue to pursue borrowing opportunities with a variety of different banks 
we have noticed a continuing trend that although pricing and loan to value ratios remain dependent on specific deal terms  generally spreads for non recourse mortgage financing are compressing and loan to value ratios are gradually increasing from levels a year ago 
the unsecured debt markets are functioning well and credit spreads are at manageable levels 
we continue to assess and beyond to ensure we are prepared if current credit market conditions deteriorate 
financial flexibility we have a secured revolving line of credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of million  subject to certain borrowing base calculations 
as of december   we did not have an outstanding balance on the line of credit 
the outstanding balance on the line of credit as of december  was million 
borrowings under the line of credit bear a floating interest rate based on eurodollar plus a margin that is determined based on our leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the line of credit agreement  which can range from to 
during  the highest balance on the line of credit was million 
the borrowings under the line of credit mature october   assuming the election of a one year extension that is available at our discretion  subject to certain conditions 
although the secured revolving line of credit is a committed facility  the financial failure of one or more of the participating financial institutions may reduce the amount of available credit for use by us 
our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue letters of credit 
our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit  but it does reduce the borrowing amount available 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit to back standby letters of credit totaling approximately million  leaving approximately million available under our secured line of credit 
pursuant to the terms of the line of credit facility  we are subject to various financial and other covenants 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants 
the most restrictive financial covenants for the line of credit facility are as follows covenant must be as of maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio minimum tangible net worth maximum dividend payout ratio secured recourse indebtedness total debt market and economic conditions although demand in the us improved in  the us macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and was the primary factor in a slowdown starting in the global economy remains unstable  and we expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging as continued economic uncertainty has generally given the marketplace less confidence 
in particular  the financial crisis that affected the banking system and financial markets and the current uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and volatility in credit  equity and fixed income markets 
if such conditions are experienced in future periods  our industry  business and results of operations may be severely impacted 
the slow recovery and possible impact of automatic sequesters or a failure to raise the debt ceiling in the us  as well as the impact of the sovereign debt crisis and resulting austerity measures in europe may continue to adversely impact us 
we believe this risk is somewhat mitigated because we are able to utilize various forms of capital to fund our operations making availability to one specific form of capital less vital and have adequate working capital provided by operating activities as noted sun communities  inc 
above 
we anticipate meeting our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  large property acquisitions  and operating partnership unit redemptions through the issuance of certain debt or equity securities and or the collateralization of our properties 
we currently have unencumbered properties with an estimated market value of million  of these properties support the borrowing base for our million secured line of credit 
from time to time  we may also issue shares of our capital stock  issue equity units in our operating partnership  obtain debt financing  or sell selected assets 
our ability to finance our long term liquidity requirements in such a manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt  our financial condition  the operating history of the properties  the state of the debt and equity markets  and the general national  regional  and local economic conditions 
when it becomes necessary for us to approach the credit markets  the volatility in those markets could make borrowing more difficult to secure  more expensive  or effectively unavailable 
see risk factors in item a 
if we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted 
contractual cash obligations our primary long term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   our outstanding contractual obligations  including interest expense  were as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total due year years years after years collateralized term loans cmbs collateralized term loans fnma aspen preferred op units and series b preferred op units lines of credit secured borrowing mortgage notes  other total principal payments interest expense operating leases total contractual obligations our contractual cash obligation related to interest expense is calculated based on the current debt levels  rates and maturities as of december  excluding secured borrowings  and actual payments required in future periods may be different than the amounts included above 
as of december   our debt to total market capitalization approximated percent assuming conversion of all common operating partnership units to shares of common stock 
our debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately years and a weighted average interest rate of percent 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included recurring capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
we are committed to the continued upkeep of our properties and therefore do not expect a significant decline in our recurring capital expenditures during sun communities  inc 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
we mitigate this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage  minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures  which include the periodic use of derivatives 
our primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability interest rate changes could have on our future cash flows 
we generally employ derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
we have three derivative contracts consisting of one interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  and two interest rate cap agreements with a total notional amount of million as of december  the swap agreement fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent through january the first interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of percent  a notional amount of million  and a termination date of april the second interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of percent  a notional amount of million through october our remaining variable rate debt totals million and million as of december  and  respectively  which bear interest at prime or various libor rates 
if prime or libor increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  we believe our interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million based on the million and million average balances outstanding under our variable rate debt facilities for the years ended december  and  respectively
