item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section provides an analysis of the corporation s consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december  and the analysis should be read in conjunction with the related audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein 
cautionary note regarding forward looking statements this annual report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  which forward looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as believe  expect  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential 
examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  estimates with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of the corporation that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates 
these factors include changes in general economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory conditions  or the development of an interest rate environment that adversely affects the corporation s interest rate spread or other income anticipated from operations and investments 
as used in this annual report  we  us and our refer to stewardship financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiary  atlantic stewardship bank  depending on the context 
introduction the corporation s primary business is the ownership and supervision of the bank and  through the bank  the corporation has been  and intends to continue to be  a community oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
the corporation currently has full service branches offices located in bergen  passaic and morris counties in new jersey 
the corporation conducts a general commercial and retail banking business encompassing a wide range of traditional deposit and lending functions along with the other customary banking services 
the corporation earns income and generates cash primarily through the deposit gathering activities of the branch network 
these deposits gathered from the general public are then utilized to fund the corporation s lending and investing activities 
the corporation has developed a strong deposit base with good franchise value 
a mix of a variety of different deposit products and electronic services  along with a strong focus on customer service  is used to attract customers and build depositor relationships 
challenges facing the corporation include our ability to continue to grow the branch deposit levels  provide adequate technology enhancements to achieve efficiencies  offer a competitive product line  and provide the highest level of customer service 
the corporation is affected by the overall economic conditions in northern new jersey  the interest rate and yield curve environment  and the overall national economy 
these factors are relevant because they will affect our ability to attract specific deposit products  our ability to invest in loan and investment products  and our ability to earn acceptable profits without incurring increased risks 
when evaluating the financial condition and operating performance of the corporation  management reviews historical trends  peer comparisons  asset and deposit concentrations  interest margin analysis  adequacy of loan loss reserve and loan quality performance  adequacy of capital under current positions as well as to support future expansion  adequacy of liquidity  and overall quality of earnings performance 
the branch network coupled with our online services provides for solid coverage in both existing and new markets in key towns in the three counties in which we operate 
the corporation continually evaluates the need to further develop the infrastructure  including electronic products and services  to enable it to continue to build franchise value and expand its existing and future customer base 
in and  the corporation  like all financial institutions  continued to experience a difficult and complicated economic and operating environment 
the corporation s results have been affected by the economic downturn through higher loan loss provisions and managing credit risk remains a significant challenge for the bank 
in addition  competition in the northern new jersey market remained intense and the challenges of operating throughout these years in a flat interest rate market continued to make it somewhat difficult to attract deposits at appropriate interest rate levels 
while the bank has seen growth in deposits  management continues to find strong competition for low cost  core deposits 
furthermore  while the current economic conditions and softness in the real estate market have contributed to an increase in loan delinquencies  new lending opportunities are being appropriately evaluated 
the corporation has not been involved in the subprime lending area 

table of contents in an effort to address the strong competition in attracting deposit balances  the corporation continues to evaluate product and services offerings 
improvements and upgrades of our electronic online banking products and services continue to be a priority 
within the last several years we introduced an online banking cash management product as well as remote deposit capture services for businesses 
in early we enhanced our security for online banking customers by upgrading to multi factor authentication sign on 
in april   after a significant amount of preparation and testing  we introduced both our application for smartphones and our application for the ipad providing additional means for our customers to access their accounts conveniently 
by december   our mobile banking application had been upgraded to include mobile deposit allowing customers to deposit checks remotely by taking pictures of checks and transmitting them 
plans for the offering of business mobile banking are in place 
beginning in mid the corporation began to experience an increase in mortgage loan refinance activity due to the corporation s promotion of a no cost closing program and the lower rate environment 
this activity has allowed the corporation to sell a larger volume into the secondary market resulting in increased gains from the sale of mortgage loans 
in addition to concentrating on increasing noninterest income  expense control continues to be a focus 
however  the increase in noninterest expense for is reflective of increasing regulatory compliance requirements and the staffing necessary to oversee all compliance related issues 
in addition  an increase in salary and employee benefits expense is the result of an increased focus on commercial lending opportunities as well as costs associated with enhancements to the credit review function 
finally  noninterest expense reflects increased costs associated with the workout of problem loans  primarily legal costs  as well as costs related to holding other real estate owned that is acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
in september  the corporation received million in connection with its participation in the treasury s small business lending fund sblf program 
in exchange  the corporation issued to the treasury  shares of senior non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b 
the corporation used the proceeds to simultaneously repurchase the corporation s shares of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a previously issued under the treasury s troubled assets relief program tarp capital purchase program the cpp 
in addition  the corporation completed the repurchase of a warrant held by the treasury that had been issued as part of the corporation participation in the tarp cpp 
the additional capital provided by the sblf further solidified our already well capitalized position  thereby enhancing our ability to continue to grow assets and increasing our ability to make new loans 
accordingly  we can better serve the lending needs of consumers and businesses in our market 
the corporation will continue to concentrate its efforts on improving asset quality  developing its existing branch network  introducing new products and services  capitalizing on technology and focusing on improved efficiencies during recent storm related events on october   super storm sandy struck the northeastern united states and significantly impacted the region including the primary operating areas of the corporation 
while we experienced no substantial damage to any of our facilities  we were affected by power outages and certain limitations on operational capabilities and many of our customers have been negatively impacted 
we have completed an assessment of the impact of super storm sandy on our business and based upon our assessment  we do not believe there has been significant adverse effect on the collateral of our borrowers and or their ability to repay their obligations to the bank 
furthermore  we do not believe that the prolonged power outages caused by the storm  that temporarily interrupted our ability to open some of our branches  has had a significant or lasting impact on our business 
nevertheless  these impacts were not favorable to our business and our assessment is preliminary and  as such  there could be an adverse effect from the storm on our future earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect on the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements can be found in note of the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this annual report on form k  are based upon the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity of u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the corporation to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the corporation s significant accounting policies 
management believes the corporation s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate  which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the corporation s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the corporation s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the northern new jersey area experience adverse economic changes 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the corporation s control

the corporation continues in its efforts to proactively manage deposit costs in an effort to mitigate the lower asset yields earned 
the reduced yields on assets reflect both an elevated level of nonperforming loans as well as historically low market rates in the current environment 

table of contents for the year ended december   total interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease was due to a decrease in yields on interest earning assets partially offset by a small increase in the average balance of interest earning assets

on an ongoing basis  management analyzes the adequacy of this allowance by considering the nature and volume of the corporation s loan activity  financial condition of the borrower  fair market value of underlying collateral  and changes in general market conditions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operations in the appropriate period 
actual loan losses  net of recoveries  serve to reduce the allowance 
the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
the loan loss provision of million for the year ended december  compares to a million loan loss provision recorded for the year ended december  the allowance for loan loss was million  or of total loans as of december  compared to million  or of total loans a year earlier 
the loan loss provision takes into account any growth or contraction in the loan portfolio and any changes in nonperforming loans as well as the impact of charge offs 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan loss  the corporation also considered the types of loans as well as the overall seasoning of new loans to determine the risk that was inherent in the portfolio 
nonperforming loans decreased from million  or of total loans at december  to million  or of total loans at december  during the year ended december   the corporation charged off million of loan balances and recovered  in previously charged off loans compared to million and  respectively  in the prior year 
the allowance for loan losses related to the impaired loans decreased from million at december  to  at december  primarily due to charge offs down to the net realizable value of collateral for some of the impaired loans 

table of contents in addition to these factors  the corporation evaluated the economic conditions and overall real estate climate in the primary business markets in which it operates when considering the overall risk of the lending portfolio 
the asset quality issues  caused by the national economic downturn which began in  and the current year charge offs and provision for loan losses are reflective of current economic conditions that contributed to an increase in loan delinquencies and the softness in the real estate market 
the corporation monitors its loan portfolio and intends to continue to provide for loan loss reserves based on its ongoing periodic review of the loan portfolio and general market conditions 
see asset quality section below for further information concerning the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming assets 
noninterest income noninterest income consists of all income other than interest income and is principally derived from service charges on deposits  income derived from bank owned life insurance  gains from calls and sales of securities  gains on sales of mortgage loans and income derived from debit cards and atm usage 
in addition  gains on sales of other real estate owned oreo are reflected as noninterest income 
noninterest income increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year

noninterest expense noninterest expense for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
noninterest expense for reflects higher salary and employee benefits expense  reflective of increasing regulatory compliance and the attendant staffing necessary to oversee all compliance related issues 
in addition  the increase in salary and employee benefits expense is the result of an increased focus on commercial lending opportunities as well as costs associated with an enhanced credit review function 
an increase in expense related to other real estate owned is reflective of increased activity

table of contents loan portfolio the corporation s loan portfolio at december   net of allowance for loan losses  totaled million  a decrease of million  or a decrease over the million at december  residential real estate mortgages increased million 
although the corporation continued its policy of selling the majority of its residential real estate loans in the secondary market  certain residential real estate loans were placed into portfolio to partially compensate for payoffs and normal amortization 
of the loans sold  all have been sold with servicing of the loan transferring to the purchaser 
commercial real estate mortgage loans consisting of million  or of the total portfolio  represent the largest portion of the loan portfolio 
these loans reflected a decrease of million from million  or of the total loan portfolio at december  commercial loans decreased million to million  representing of the total loan portfolio 
consumer installment loans and home equity loans decreased million and million  respectively  partially attributable to borrowers continuing to consolidate secondary liens on their homes as they refinance in the lower interest rate environment 
the corporation s lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate located in northern new jersey 
accordingly  the collectability of a substantial portion of the corporation s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in real estate market conditions in northern new jersey 
the corporation has not made loans to borrowers outside the united states 
at december   aside from the real estate concentration described above  there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans outstanding 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 
the following table sets forth the classification of the corporation s loans by major category at the end of each of the last five years december  in thousands real estate mortgage residential     commercial    commercial loans     consumer loans installment     home equity     other total gross loans     less allowance for loan losses    deferred loan fees costs net loans     includes construction loans

inherent in the lending function is the risk of deterioration in a borrower s ability to repay loans under existing loan agreements 
to address this risk  reserves are maintained to absorb probable incurred loan losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management of the corporation considers the risks inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activities  along with general economic and real estate market conditions 
although management attempts to establish a reserve sufficient to offset probable incurred losses in the portfolio  changes in economic conditions  regulatory policies and borrower s performance could require future changes to the allowance 
in establishing the allowance for loan losses  the corporation utilizes a two tiered approach by identifying problem loans and allocating specific loss allowances to such loans and establishing a general valuation allowance on the remainder of its loan portfolio 
the corporation maintains a loan review system that allows for a periodic review of its loan portfolio and the early identification of potential problem loans 
such a system takes into consideration  among other things  delinquency status  size of loans  type of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers 
allocations of specific loan loss allowances are established for identified loans based on a review of various information including appraisals of underlying collateral 
appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of impaired  collateral dependent loans 
appraisals are periodically updated to ascertain any further decline in value 
general loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
the corporation s accounting policies are set forth in note to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
the application of some of these policies requires significant management judgment and the utilization of estimates 
actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates resulting in a significant impact on the financial statements 
a critical accounting policy for the corporation is the policy utilized in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the corporation s lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate located in northern new jersey 
accordingly  the collectability of a substantial portion of the corporation s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in real estate market conditions in northern new jersey 
future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory  and other conditions beyond the corporation s control 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses totaling million is adequate to cover probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio at december  
table of contents nonperforming assets risk elements include nonaccrual loans  past due and restructured loans  potential problem loans  loan concentrations and other real estate owned ie  property acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
the corporation s loans are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal and interest or earlier if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
interest previously accrued on these loans and not yet paid is charged against income during the current period 
interest earned thereafter is only included in income to the extent that it is received in cash 
loans past due days or more and accruing represent those loans which are in the process of collection  adequately collateralized and management believes all interest and principal owed will be collected 
restructured loans are loans that have been renegotiated to permit a borrower  who has incurred adverse financial circumstances  to continue to perform 
management can make concessions to the terms of the loan or reduce the contractual interest rates to below market rates in order for the borrower to continue to make payments 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain information regarding the corporation s nonperforming assets as of december of each of the preceding five years december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans construction     residential real estate   commercial real estate    commercial     consumer  total nonaccrual loans    loans past due days or more and accruing construction commercial real estate commercial consumer total loans past due ninety days or more and accruing total nonperforming loans    other real estate owed   total nonperforming assets    restructured loans construction  commercial real estate   commercial    total restructured loans   allowance for loan losses    nonaccrual loans to total gross loans nonperforming loans to total gross loans nonperforming assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans restructured loans classified in the nonaccrual category totaled million  million  million   and  for the years ended december     and  respectively 
there were no restructured loans classified in the past due days or more and accruing for any years presented 
any restructured loans that are on nonaccrual status are only reported in nonaccrual loans and not reflected in restructured loans 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the identification of nonaccrual loans reflects careful monitoring of the loan portfolio 
the corporation is focused on resolving the nonperforming loans and mitigating future losses in the portfolio 
all delinquent loans continue to be reviewed by management 
at december   the nonaccrual loans were comprised of loans  primarily commercial real estate loans  commercial loans and construction loans 
while the corporation maintains strong underwriting requirements  the number and amount of nonaccrual loans is a reflection of the prolonged weakened economic conditions and the corresponding effects it has had on our commercial borrowers and the current real estate environment 
certain loans  including restructured loans  are current  but in accordance with applicable guidance and cautious review  management has continued to keep these loans on nonaccrual 

table of contents since december   nonperforming loans have decreased million to million at december  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased to at december  from at december  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans is reflective of detailed analysis and the probable incurred losses we have identified with these nonperforming loans 
this metric reflects the effect of the decrease in nonaccrual loans partially offset by a decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
evaluation of all nonperforming loans includes the updating of appraisals and specific evaluation of such loans to determine estimated cash flows from business and or collateral 
we have assessed these loans for collectability and considered  among other things  the borrower s ability to repay  the value of the underlying collateral  and other market conditions to ensure the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
the majority of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate collateral 
while our nonperforming loans have remained elevated  we have recorded appropriate charge offs and the underlying collateral coverage for a considerable portion of the nonperforming loans currently supports the collection of our remaining principal 
for loans not included in nonperforming loans  at december   the level of loans past due days was million  an increase from million at december  we will continue to monitor delinquencies for early identification of new problem loans 
while not comprising a significantly large portion of the loan portfolio  a number of problem loans are commercial construction loans which have been affected by the struggling construction industry 
as such  the entire commercial construction portfolio is being actively monitored 
the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level considered by management to be adequate to cover the probable incurred losses associated with its loan portfolio 
the corporation s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the portfolio  consideration of the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  the level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
primarily as a result of the continuing higher level of nonperforming loans  the corporation continues to record an elevated provision for loan losses 
for the years ended december  and  the provision for loan losses was million and million  respectively 
the total allowance for loan losses represented of total loans at december  compared to a ratio of at december  at december  and  the corporation had million and million  respectively  of loans whose terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings 
of these loans  million and million were performing in accordance with their new terms at december  and  respectively 
the remaining troubled debt restructures are reported as nonaccrual loans 
specific reserves of  and million have been allocated for the troubled debt restructurings at december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the corporation had committed  and  respectively  of additional funds to a single customer with an outstanding construction loan that is classified as a troubled debt restructuring 
included in performing restructured loans as of december  is a loan for million for which the estate of our borrower was provided with a forbearance to allow time to market for sale the underlying commercial real estate collateral 
the property was sold in and the corporation collected all outstanding principal and accrued interest owed under the loan 
the balance in performing restructured loans also includes two loans to a related borrower for million at both december  and while these loans are current under their restructured terms  because of the below market rate of interest  these loans will continue to be reflected as restructured loans in accordance with accounting practices 
for the year ended december   gross interest income which would have been recorded had the restructured and non accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to  million  of which  was included in interest income for the year ended december  
table of contents when it is believed that some portion or all of a loan balance will not be collected  that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance for loan losses 
for the year ended december   net charge offs were million compared to million for the year ended december  included in charge offs for the current year is one loan for million 
during the second quarter of  management placed the loan on nonaccrual status based on developments relating to the borrower which have impacted the borrower s repayment ability 
during the fourth quarter of  management made the decision to charge off this loan in its entirety as collectability was believed to be remote 
while regular monthly payments continue to be made on many of the nonaccrual loans  certain charge offs result  nevertheless  from the borrowers inability to provide adequate documentation evidencing their ability to continue to service their debt 
therefore  consideration has been given to any underlying collateral and appropriate charge offs recorded based  in general  on the deficiency of such collateral 
in general  the charge offs reflect partial writedowns and full charge offs on nonaccrual loans due to the initial evaluation of market values of the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with accounting standards codification asc in addition  the current year reflects an increased level of charge offs of previously established reserves that were based on analysis of the discounted cash flows for non real estate collateral dependent loans 
management believes the charge off of these reserves provides a clearer indication of the value of nonaccrual loans 
the charge off of reserves increases the average historical charge off experience  thereby resulting in an increase in corporation s level of general reserves on performing loans 
in addition to our actions of recording partial and full charge offs on loans  we continue to aggressively pursue collection  including legal action 
as of december   there were million of other loans not included in the preceding risk elements table  compared to million at december   where credit conditions of borrowers  including real estate tax delinquencies  caused management to have concerns about the possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming loans at a future date 
these loans have been considered by management in conjunction with the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

the corporation s borrowings are a combination of advances from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb ny  including overnight repricing lines of credit  and  to a lesser extent  securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate movements have made managing the corporation s interest rate sensitivity increasingly important 
the corporation attempts to maintain stable net interest margins by generally matching the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing  or subject to repricing  by adjusting interest rates to market conditions  and by developing new products 
one method of measuring the corporation s exposure to changes in interest rates is the maturity and repricing gap analysis 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice in a given period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
a negative gap results when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period of time 
conversely  a positive gap results when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceed the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same given time frame 
the smaller the gap  the less the effect of the market volatility on net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position would not be in as favorable a position  as compared to an institution with a positive gap  to invest in higher yielding assets 
this may result in yields on its assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its costs of interest bearing liabilities than if it had a positive gap 
during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities  which consequently may result in its net interest income growing at a faster rate than an institution with a positive gap position 
the following table sets forth estimated maturity repricing structure of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability and adjusted for prepayment assumptions where applicable 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the corporation s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities  for example  prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits  is beyond the corporation s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels

the corporation also uses a simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income  net income  net interest margin  and capital to asset ratios based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of all rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
management incorporates into the model certain assumptions regarding prepayments of certain assets and liabilities 
assumptions have been built into the model for prepayments for assets and decay rates for nonmaturity deposits such as savings and interest bearing demand 
the model assumes an immediate rate shock to interest rates without management s ability to proactively change the mix of assets or liabilities 
based on the reports generated for december   an immediate interest rate increase of basis points would have resulted in a decrease in net interest income of  or  and an immediate interest rate decrease of basis points would have resulted in a decrease in net interest income of or million 
management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on the corporation s net interest income 
liquidity the corporation s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities amortization and maturities of investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flow and prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 

table of contents the corporation s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of its operating  investing and financing activities

the primary source of cash from operating activities during each period was operating income 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments  such as federal funds sold 
the corporation enters into commitments to extend credit  such as letters of credit  which are not reflected in the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
the corporation has various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
the following table summarizes the corporation s contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payment due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations    total contracted cost obligations    other long term liabilities long term debt time deposits     federal home loan bank advances  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  subordinated debentures   total other long term liabilities long term debt  other commitments off balance sheet letters of credit   commitments to extend credit   unused lines of credit   total off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations management believes that a significant portion of the time deposits will remain with the corporation 
in addition  management does not believe that all of the unused lines of credit will be exercised 
we anticipate that the corporation will have sufficient funds available to meet its current contractual commitments 
should we need temporary funding  the corporation has the ability to borrow overnight with the fhlb ny 
the overall borrowing capacity is contingent on available collateral to secure borrowings and the ability to purchase additional activity based capital stock of the fhlb ny 
the corporation may also borrow from the discount window of the federal reserve bank of new york based on the market value of collateral pledged 
at december  and  the borrowing capacity at the discount window was million 
in addition  the corporation had available overnight variable repricing lines of credit with other correspondent banks totaling million on an unsecured basis 
there were no borrowings under these lines of credit at december  and 
table of contents the corporation exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
the corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
of the million commitments under standby and commercial letters of credit  million expire within one year 
should any letter of credit be drawn on  the interest rate charged on the resulting note would fluctuate with the corporation base rate 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the corporation evaluates each customer creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the corporation upon extension of credit  is based on management credit evaluation of the counter party 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee payment or performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the corporation obtains collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
at december   the corporation had residential mortgage commitments to extend credit aggregating approximately  at variable rates averaging and million at fixed rates averaging 
approximately million of these loan commitments will be sold to investors upon closing 
commercial  construction  and home equity loan commitments of approximately million were extended with variable rates averaging and  were extended at fixed rates averaging 
generally  commitments were due to expire within approximately days 
the unused lines of credit consist of million relating to a home equity line of credit program and an unsecured line of credit program cash reserve  million relating to an unsecured overdraft protection program  and million relating to commercial and construction lines of credit 
amounts drawn on the unused lines of credit are predominantly assessed interest at rates which fluctuate with the base rate 
capital banks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and  additionally for banks  prompt corrective action regulations  involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators 
failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action 
regulations of the board of governors of the frb require bank holding companies to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
under the regulations in effect at december   the corporation was required to maintain i a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total adjusted assets of and ii minimum ratios of tier and total capital to risk weighted assets of and  respectively 
the bank must comply with substantially similar capital regulations promulgated by the fdic

institutions  which are not top rated  will be expected to maintain a ratio of approximately to basis points above this ratio 
on september   in exchange for issuing  shares of senior non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b the series b preferred shares  having a liquidation preference of  per share  the corporation received million as part of the treasury s sblf program 
the sblf is a billion fund established under the small business jobs act of that encourages lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than billion 
using proceeds of the issuance of the series b preferred shares  the corporation simultaneously repurchased all  shares of its fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  liquidation amount  per share the series a preferred shares previously issued under the tarp cpp  for a purchase price of  including accrued but unpaid dividends through the date of repurchase 
the series b preferred shares pay a non cumulative quarterly dividend in arrears 
the corporation accrues the preferred dividends as earned over the period the series b preferred shares are outstanding 
the dividend rate can fluctuate on a quarterly basis during the first ten quarters during which the series b preferred shares are outstanding  based upon changes in the level of qualified small business lending qsbl as defined in the securities purchase agreement 
in general  the dividend rate decreases as the level of the bank s qsbl increases 
based upon the bank s level of qsbl over a baseline level  the dividend rate for the initial dividend period was 
during  the dividend rate ranged between and 
the dividend rate for future dividend periods will be set based upon changes in the level of qsbl as compared to the baseline level 
such dividend rate may vary from to per annum for the second through tenth dividend periods and from to for the eleventh through the first half of the nineteenth dividend periods  to reflect the amount of change in the bank s level of qsbl 
in the event that the series b preferred shares remain outstanding for more than four and one half years  the dividend rate will be fixed at 
such dividends are not cumulative but the corporation may only declare and pay dividends on its common stock or any other equity securities junior to the series b preferred stock if it has declared and paid dividends on the series b preferred shares for the current dividend period and will be subject to other restrictions on its ability to repurchase or redeem other securities 
subject to regulatory approval  the corporation may redeem the series b preferred shares at any time 
the series b preferred shares are includable in tier i capital for regulatory capital 
on october   the corporation completed the repurchase of the year warrant held by the treasury which was issued as part of the corporation participation in the tarp cpp  and entitled the treasury to purchase  shares of the corporation s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the corporation paid a total of  to the treasury to repurchase the warrant
