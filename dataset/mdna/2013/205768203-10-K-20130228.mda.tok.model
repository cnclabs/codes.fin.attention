item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical consolidated financial data and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas in the united states 
we own interests in  producing oil and natural gas wells net to us and we operate of these wells 
in managing our business  we are concerned primarily with maximizing return on our stockholders equity 
to accomplish this goal  we focus on profitably increasing our oil and natural gas reserves and production 
our future growth will be driven primarily by acquisition  development and exploration activities 
in our growth in production and proved reserves was primarily driven by our successful oil focused drilling activities 
under our current drilling budget  we plan to spend approximately million in for development and exploration activities  which will primarily be focused on oil projects 
we plan to drill wells net to us in  of which wells net to us will target oil in our south texas and west texas regions and ten will target natural gas in our east texas north louisiana region 
however  we could increase or decrease the number of wells that we drill depending on oil and natural gas prices 
we do not specifically budget for acquisitions as the timing and size of acquisitions are not predictable 

table of contents we use the successful efforts method of accounting  which allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration activities 
accordingly  our exploration costs consist of costs we incur to acquire and reprocess d seismic data  impairments of our unevaluated leasehold where we were not successful in discovering reserves and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells that we drill 
we generally sell our oil and natural gas at current market prices at the point our wells connect to third party purchaser pipelines 
we have entered into certain transportation and treating agreements with midstream and pipeline companies to transport a substantial portion of our natural gas production in north louisiana to long haul gas pipelines 
we market our products several different ways depending upon a number of factors  including the availability of purchasers for the product  the availability and cost of pipelines near our wells  market prices  pipeline constraints and operational flexibility 
accordingly  our revenues are heavily dependent upon the prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
our operating costs are generally comprised of several components  including costs of field personnel  insurance  repair and maintenance costs  production supplies  fuel used in operations  transportation costs  workover expenses and state production and ad valorem taxes 
like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  we face the constant challenge of replacing our reserves 
although in the past we have offset the effect of declining production rates from existing properties through successful acquisition and drilling efforts  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offset production declines or maintain production at current rates through future acquisitions or drilling activity 
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add new reserves in excess of production 
our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  and operating safety 
future laws or regulations  any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
applicable environmental regulations require us to remove our equipment after production has ceased  to plug and abandon our wells and to remediate any environmental damage our operations may have caused 
the present value of the estimated future costs to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and remove our production facilities is included in our reserve for future abandonment costs  which was million as of december

oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales decreased million in to million from sales of million in our oil production in increased by while our natural gas production decreased by from our production levels 
on an equivalent unit basis  our production in increased by over our successful drilling program grew our oil production which offset the decline in natural gas production 
prices realized for oil sales increased by in as compared to while the average price we realized for natural gas sales decreased by in as compared to our oil hedging program generated million in realized gains in including the results of our hedging program  our average oil price in of increased above last year s average price 
production taxes 
production taxes increased million or to million in from million in the increase in is due to the significant growth in our oil sales during the year 
much of our natural gas sales in and qualify for exemption from state production taxes 
gathering and transportation 
gathering and transportation costs in decreased million to million as compared to million in due to the lower natural gas volumes that we produced in north louisiana in lease operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses  including ad valorem taxes  of million in were million or higher than our operating expenses of million in our lease operating expense per mcfe produced increased by to per mcfe in as compared to per mcfe in the increase mainly reflects our growing oil production 
our oil wells are typically more costly to operate than our natural gas wells

depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a 
dd a of million was an increase of million over dd a of million in our dd a rate per mcfe produced averaged in as compared to for the increase in dd a primarily resulted from increased development costs per mcfe associated with the oil wells drilled in  and the substantial decline in our proved natural gas reserves due to the low natural gas prices in impairment of oil and gas properties 
we recorded impairments to our oil and gas properties of million and million in and  respectively 
these impairments relate to fields where an impairment was indicated based on estimated future cash flows from the properties 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense of million for was lower than general and administrative expense of million for the decrease primarily reflects lower stock based compensation in stock based compensation decreased by million to million in as compared to million in interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in from interest expense of million in the increase was primarily related to the increase in outstanding debt during including the issuance of million in senior notes in june average borrowings under our bank credit facility increased to million in as compared to million for the average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of in was higher than the interest rate of in we capitalized interest of million and million in and  respectively  which amounts reduced interest expense 
income taxes 
the benefit from income taxes increased in to million from million in due to the higher net loss in our effective tax rate of in and in differed from the federal income tax rate of primarily due to the effect of nondeductible compensation and state income taxes 
net loss 
we reported a loss of million for as compared to a loss of million for the loss per share for was on weighted average shares outstanding of million as compared to a loss per share of for on weighted average shares outstanding of million

oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales increased million in to million from sales of million in this increase resulted from higher natural gas production and higher prices realized for oil sales in our production in increased by over s production as production from new wells drilled in south texas targeting the eagle ford shale and in north louisiana targeting the haynesville bossier shales exceeded declines from our existing producing properties 
prices realized for oil sales increased by in as compared to while the average price we realized for natural gas sales decreased by in as compared to during we drilled wells net to us  of which were haynesville or bossier shale horizontal wells and of which were eagle ford shale horizontal wells 
at december  we had wells net to us that were drilled in awaiting completion 
production taxes 
production taxes decreased million to million in from million in our haynesville and bossier shale wells  which comprise a large percentage of our production  qualify for exemption from certain state production taxes 
the exempt wells together with the lower natural gas prices account for the decrease 
gathering and transportation 
gathering and transportation costs in increased million to million as compared to million in due to the transportation costs related to the higher production from our haynesville bossier shale properties in north louisiana 
lease operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses  including ad valorem taxes  of million in were million or lower than our operating expenses of million in our lease operating expense per mcfe produced decreased by to per mcfe in as compared to per mcfe in the decreases in lease operating expenses are primarily due to the sale of our higher operating cost properties in mississippi in exploration expense 
we incurred million in exploration expense in as compared to million in exploration expense in consisted of million of impairments of unevaluated leasehold costs and million for the acquisition of seismic data 
our exploration cost primarily related to costs incurred for the acquisition of seismic data 

table of contents dd a 
dd a of million increased million as compared to dd a of million in our dd a rate per mcfe produced averaged in as compared to for the increase in dd a primarily resulted from our growth in production in impairment of oil and gas properties 
we recorded impairments to our oil and gas properties of million and million in and  respectively 
these impairments relate to fields where an impairment was indicated based on estimated future cash flows from the properties 
the impairment is a result of lower anticipated natural gas prices 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense of million for was lower than general and administrative expense of million for the decrease primarily reflects our lower personnel costs in stock based compensation decreased by million to million in as compared to million in interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in from interest expense of million in the increase was primarily related to the increase in outstanding debt during including the issuance of million in senior notes in march average borrowings under our bank credit facility increased to million in as compared to million for the average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of in was unchanged from we capitalized interest of million and million in and  respectively  which reduced interest expense 
interest expense in includes million for the early retirement of our senior notes which were due in march income taxes 
the benefit from income taxes increased in to million from million in due to the higher net loss in our effective tax rate of in and in differed from the federal income tax rate of primarily due to the effect of nondeductible compensation and state income taxes 
net loss 
we reported a loss of million for as compared to a loss of million for the loss per share for was on weighted average shares outstanding of million as compared to a loss per share of for on weighted average shares outstanding of million 
the loss in was primarily related to the impairments to proved and unproved properties in of million million after income taxes offset in part by gains on sales of marketable securities of million million after income taxes 
the loss in was primarily related to the loss on our divestiture of oil and gas properties in mississippi of million million after income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources funding for our activities has historically been provided by our operating cash flow  debt or equity financings and asset dispositions 
our net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
our other primary sources of funds in included million of net proceeds from a senior notes offering and million from sales of assets 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million  while our other primary sources of funds included million of net proceeds from a senior notes offering  million of borrowings under our bank credit facility and million of proceeds from sales of marketable securities 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled million 
our other primary source of funds in was million of net proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties and marketable securities and million of borrowings under our bank credit facility 
our cash flow from operating activities in of million represented a decrease of million from our cash from operating activities of million in cash flow from 
table of contents operations excluding changes in working capital accounts of million in decreased by million or as compared to million in due to the lower revenues we received because of the decline in natural gas prices during which was partially offset by higher oil production 
our cash flow from operating activities in decreased by million to million as compared to million in primarily due to changes in working capital at the end of our primary need for capital  in addition to funding our ongoing operations  relates to the acquisition  development and exploration of our oil and gas properties and the repayment of our debt 
during our capital expenditures of million decreased by million as compared to capital expenditures of billion due primarily to the acquisitions of proved and unproved properties we made in capital expenditures in include million spent to complete wells drilled in in  our capital expenditures of billion increased by million as compared to capital expenditures of million  mainly due to the acquisition of oil and gas properties in our annual capital expenditure activity is summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands exploration and development acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties acquisitions of unproved oil and gas properties developmental leasehold costs development drilling exploratory drilling workovers and recompletions other total excludes reimbursements from joint venture partner for preformation well costs of million 
the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long term capital expenditure commitments except for contracted drilling and completion services 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
we currently expect to spend approximately million for development and exploration projects and lease acquisitions in  which will be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from asset sales and borrowings under our credit facility 
our operating cash flow and  therefore  our capital expenditures are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices and  in particular  natural gas prices 
we do not have a specific acquisition budget for because the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
smaller acquisitions will generally be funded from operating cash flow 
with respect to significant acquisitions  we intend to use borrowings under our bank credit facility  or other debt or equity financings to the extent available  to finance such acquisitions 
the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance and some of which will be beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates  oil and natural gas prices and other market conditions 
lack of access to the debt or equity markets due to general economic conditions could impede our ability to complete acquisitions 
we have a million bank credit facility with bank of montreal  as the administrative agent 
the bank credit facility is a five year revolving credit commitment that matures on november  
table of contents indebtedness under the bank credit facility is secured by all of our and our wholly owned subsidiaries assets and is guaranteed by all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the bank credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability  which is redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties 
as of december   the borrowing base was million  million of which was available 
the borrowing base may be affected by the performance of our properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the determination of the borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest  based on the utilization of the borrowing base  at our option at either libor plus to or the base rate which is the higher of the administrative agent s prime rate  the federal funds rate plus or day libor plus plus to 
a commitment fee of is payable on the unused borrowing base 
the bank credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the payment of cash dividends in excess of million  limit the amount of consolidated debt that we may incur and limit our ability to make certain loans and investments 
the only financial covenants are the maintenance of a ratio of current assets  including the availability under the bank credit facility  to current liabilities and maintenance of a leverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  we have million of senior notes outstanding which are due october   million of senior notes outstanding which are due april  and million of senior notes outstanding which are due june  all senior notes have semi annual interest payment obligations  are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by all of our material subsidiaries 
on january   we had million in principal amount of senior notes outstanding due in the notes 
we redeemed all of the notes in for million 
the early extinguishment of the notes resulted in a loss of million 
this loss is comprised of the premium paid for the redemption of the notes  the costs incurred related to the tender offer  and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the notes 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and future growth as contemplated under our current business plan 
however  if our plans or assumptions change or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital  or if such capital is available  that we will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
the following table summarizes our aggregate liabilities and commitments by year of maturity thereafter total in thousands bank credit facility senior notes senior notes senior notes interest on debt operating leases natural gas transportation agreements contracted drilling services future interest costs are based upon the effective interest rates of our outstanding senior notes and the december  rate for our bank credit facility 

table of contents we have obligations to incur future payments for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties 
these payments are currently estimated to be incurred primarily after we record a separate liability for the fair value of these asset retirement obligations  which totaled million as of december  federal taxation at december  we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and louisiana state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
utilization of million of our us federal net operating loss carryforwards is limited to approximately million per year pursuant to a prior change of control of an acquired company and a valuation allowance of million has been established for the estimated us federal net operating loss carryforwards that will not be utilized 
realization of the remaining us federal net operating loss carryforwards requires comstock to generate taxable income within the carryforward period 
a valuation allowance of million has been established against our louisiana state net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of generating taxable income in the state of louisiana prior to the expiration of the carryforward period 
our federal income tax returns for the years subsequent to december  remain subject to examination 
our income tax returns in major state income tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination for various periods subsequent to december  we currently believe that our significant filing positions are highly certain and that all of our significant income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained upon audit or the final resolution would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we have not established any significant reserves for uncertain tax positions 
interest and penalties resulting from audits by tax authorities have been immaterial and are included in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses 
successful efforts accounting 
we are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies 
there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with finding oil and natural gas reserves  including certain general and administrative expenses 
the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration projects 
costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive oil and gas reserves were not found 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas activities and we do not capitalize any of our general and administrative expenses 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities 
the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
the determination of whether impairments should be recognized on our oil and gas properties is also dependent on these estimates  as well as estimates of probable reserves 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data  production history and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
because all reserve 
table of contents estimates are to some degree imprecise  the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas prices may all differ materially from those assumed in these estimates 
the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
thus  such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities  production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices 
any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition  our borrowing ability  our future prospects and the value of our common stock 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we evaluate our properties on a field area basis for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset s carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows  then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
expected future cash flows are determined using estimated future prices based on market based forward prices applied to projected future production volumes 
the projected production volumes are based on the property s proved and risk adjusted probable oil and natural gas reserve estimates at the end of the period 
the estimated future cash flows that we use in our assessment of the need for an impairment are based on market prices for oil and natural gas for the next three years  with a escalation of prices for subsequent years 
prices are not escalated to levels that exceed observed historical market prices 
costs are also assumed to escalate at a rate that is based on our historical experience  currently estimated at per annum 
the oil and natural gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows because the standardized measure requires the use of the average first day of the month historical price for the year 
to the extent that oil and natural gas prices do not increase as anticipated in these assumptions or costs increase at a greater rate than assumed  certain of our evaluated properties which presently have a carrying value of million may require impairment in the future 
the amount of such impairments would be based on the write down of these properties to their then current estimated fair value 
in addition to these properties  other properties may become impaired due to downward revisions in reserve or price estimates or for other reasons 
asset retirement obligations 
we have obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of any surface equipment used in production operations 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
stock based compensation 
we follow the fair value based method in accounting for equity based compensation 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the award vesting period 
related party transactions in recent years  we have not entered into any material transactions with our officers or directors apart from the compensation they are provided for their services 
we also have not entered into any business transactions with our significant stockholders or any other related parties 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and natural gas prices our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
factors influencing oil and natural gas prices include the level of global demand for oil  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions which determine the demand for natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on our oil and natural gas production in  a change in the price per barrel of oil would have resulted in a change in our cash flow for such period by approximately million and a change in the price per mcf of natural gas would have changed our cash flow by approximately million 
we have entered into oil price swap agreements covering million barrels of our expected oil production which fix the nymex west texas intermediate wti price at per barrel 
as of december   our outstanding oil swap agreements had a fair value of million 
the change in the fair value of our oil swaps that would result from a change in commodities prices at december  would be million 
such a change in fair value could be a gain or a loss depending on whether prices increase or decrease 
interest rates at december   we had billion of long term debt 
of this amount  million bears interest at  million bears interest at a fixed rate of  and million bears interest at the fair market value of our fixed rate debt as of december  was million based on the market price of approximately of the face amount 
at december   we had million outstanding under our bank credit facility  which is subject to variable rates of interest 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is tied to libor or the corporate base rate  at our option 
any increase in these interest rates would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
based on borrowings outstanding at december   a basis point change in interest rates would change our annual interest expense on our variable rate debt by approximately million 
we had no interest rate derivatives outstanding during or at december
