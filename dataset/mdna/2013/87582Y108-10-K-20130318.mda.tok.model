item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors and forward looking statements sections of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview tangoe is a leading global provider of communications lifecycle management  or clm  software and services to a wide range of large and medium sized commercial enterprises and governmental agencies 
clm encompasses the entire lifecycle of an enterprise communications assets and services  including planning and sourcing  procurement and provisioning  inventory and usage management  mobile device management  real time telecommunications expense management  invoice processing  expense allocation and accounting  and asset decommissioning and disposal 
our on demand communications management platform is a suite of software designed to manage and optimize the complex processes and expenses associated with this lifecycle for both fixed and mobile communications assets and services 
our customers can engage us through our client services group to manage their communications assets and services using our communications management platform 
our solution can provide a significant return on investment by enabling an enterprise to identify and resolve billing errors  to optimize communications service plans for its usage patterns and needs  and to manage used and unused communications assets and services 
our solution allows enterprises to improve the productivity of their employees by automating the provisioning of communications assets and services  and to reduce costs by controlling and allocating communications expenses 
it also allows enterprises to enforce regulatory requirements and internal policies governing the use of communications assets and services 
we designed our business model to sell recurring technology and services leveraging our communications management platform 
we review four key business metrics to help us monitor the performance of our business model and to identify trends affecting our business 
the measures that we believe are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual performance are as follows adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense  other expense  income tax provision  depreciation and amortization  amortization of marketing agreement intangible assets  stock based compensation expense and increase in fair value of warrants for redeemable convertible preferred stock  less amortization of leasehold interest  interest income and other income  and also include in adjusted ebitda adjustments for other non cash and non recurring items applicable for the periods presented 
our management uses adjusted ebitda to measure our operating performance because it does not include the impact of items not directly resulting from our core business and certain non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
we believe that this measure provides us with additional useful information to measure and understand our performance on a consistent basis  particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period 
we use adjusted ebitda in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies 
adjusted ebitda is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  and is not a substitute for or superior to financial measures determined in accordance with gaap 
other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda in a manner 
table of contents differently from us  which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure 
our adjusted ebitda has increased annually for each fiscal year since and we expect it to continue to increase in our fiscal year ending december  for further discussion regarding adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss  see footnote to the selected financial data section of this annual report on form k 
recurring technology and services revenue growth 
in  we began a strategic initiative to transition our business model from selling transactional software licenses to providing recurring technology enabled services leveraging both our technology and communications industry experience 
we further implemented this initiative with the acquisition of traq wireless  inc  or traq  as discussed below 
traq revenue base was primarily recurring  which substantially increased our recurring revenue 
we regularly review our recurring revenue growth to measure our success 
we intend to continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts on increasing our recurring technology and services related customer base  and we expect that our recurring technology and services revenue will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue over the next months due to our expectation that we will be able to retain a high percentage of the revenue we currently derive from our existing customers  sell additional product and service offerings to our existing customers  and add a significant number of new customers 
we believe that we will be able to retain a high percentage of our existing recurring technology and services revenue due to our revenue retention rates  and the current levels of customer usage of our products and services  which we review on a monthly basis to provide an indication of impending increases or decreases in billed revenue for future periods 
we believe that we will be able to sell additional product and service offerings to our existing customers in the next year based on our analysis of revenue on a per customer basis for the last months  which indicates that our customers on an aggregate basis have generally increased their usage of our solution on a quarterly basis 
we believe that we will be able to add a significant number of new customers over the next months as we continue to expand internationally and increase our share of the domestic market 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue consists of the amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue  including advanced billed and undelivered portions of our communication management platform subscriptions and related services  maintenance on our software licenses and implementation fees 
we invoice our services to many of our customers in advance  with the intervals ranging from to months 
we monitor our deferred revenue balance as this balance represents revenue to be recognized over the next months except for a portion of implementation and software subscription fees 
implementation fees are recognized ratably over twice the term of the contract  which we estimate to be the expected life of the customer relationship 
software subscription fees are recognized ratably over the service period 
as of december   implementation fees and subscription fees represented million and million  respectively  of the million deferred revenue balance 
revenue retention rates 
in addition  we consider our revenue retention rates 
since we began to fully realize the benefits of our recurring revenue model in  our revenue retention rates have been higher than 
we measure revenue retention rates by assessing on a dollar basis the recurring technology and services revenue we retain for the same customer and product set in a given period versus the prior year period 
we cannot predict our revenue retention rates in future periods 
our use of a revenue retention rate has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation 
other companies in our industry may calculate revenue retention rates differently  which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure 

table of contents we also review a number of other quantitative and qualitative trends in monitoring our performance  including our share of the clm market  our customer satisfaction rates  our ability to attract  hire and retain a sufficient number of talented employees to staff our growing business and the development and performance of our solutions 
our review of these factors can affect aspects of our business and operations on an on going basis  including potential acquisition strategies and investment in specific areas of product development or service support 
certain trends and uncertainties the following represents a summary of certain trends and uncertainties  which could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
this summary is not intended to be a complete list of potential trends and uncertainties that could impact our business in the long or short term 
this summary  however  should be considered along with the factors identified in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
the clm market is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service introductions  including frequent introductions of new technologies and devices 
to achieve and maintain market acceptance for our solution  we must effectively anticipate these changes and offer software products and services that respond to them in a timely manner 
if we fail to develop software products and services that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and cost effective manner  our ability to renew our agreements with existing customers and our ability to create or increase demand for our solution will be harmed 
we believe that competition will continue to increase 
increased competition could result from existing competitors or new competitors that enter the market because of the potential opportunity 
we will continue to closely monitor competitive activity and respond accordingly 
increased competition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to closely monitor current economic conditions  as any decline in the general economic environment that negatively affects the financial condition of our customers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  during the most recent economic downturn  our customer cancellation rate during the first quarter of increased to a quarterly rate of over three times the average of the prior four quarters  partly as a result of customer bankruptcies 
although economic conditions have generally improved  there has not been a full recovery to the levels that generally existed prior to the downturn 
if economic conditions in the united states and other countries do not continue to improve  we may face greater risks in operating our business

we continue to migrate to our platforms the customers of several of the businesses that we acquired during and we have completed the migration of the telwares customers  and the migration of the hcl ems  profitline and symphony customers are in various stages of completion 
while to date we have successfully migrated a number of these customers  there can be no assurance that we will complete these migrations in a timely manner or at all and the cost of these migrations may be more significant than we have estimated 
we may pursue additional acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses  services and technologies that will expand the functionality of our solution  provide access to new markets or customers  or otherwise complement our existing operations 

table of contents sources of revenue recurring technology and services revenue 
we derive our recurring technology and services revenue primarily from subscriptions and services related to our communications management platform 
we recognize revenue for software and related services when all of the following conditions are met a there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the service has been provided to the customer  c the collection of the contracted fee is probable  and d the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable 
these services include help desk  asset procurement and provisioning  and carrier dispute resolution 
the recurring technology and services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term 
in  we began a strategic initiative to transition our business model from selling non recurring transactional software licenses to providing recurring technology and services leveraging both our technology and communications industry experience 
we license our on demand software and sell related services primarily on a subscription basis under agreements that typically have terms ranging from to months 
our recurring technology and services revenue is driven primarily by the amount of communications spend that we manage for fixed line contracts and by the number of mobile devices that we manage for mobile device contracts 
our customers are typically subject to a minimum charge for up to a specified threshold amount of communications spend or number of mobile devices under management and additional charges to the extent those specified thresholds are exceeded 
prior to  as a result of limited history regarding customer renewals  implementation fees related to subscription agreements for our communications management platform with terms equal to or less than months were recognized over months and implementation fees related to subscription agreements with terms exceeding months were recognized over the life of the agreement 
in  due to having greater evidence regarding customer renewals  we believed it was appropriate to extend the estimated expected life of the customer relationship to be equal to twice the contract life calculated on a per customer basis and to recognize implementation fees ratably over this period 
this change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
many of our subscription contracts are non cancelable  although customers have the right to terminate for cause if we materially fail to perform 
in  we began to amortize the value of a warrant to purchase common stock issued to ibm as part of a strategic relationship agreement 
this related charge will be recorded as contra revenue in proportion to total expected revenue from the agreement 
we recorded   and  of amortization as a contra revenue charge during the years ended december   and  respectively 
strategic consulting  software licenses and other revenue 
in addition to our subscription fees  revenue is generated to a lesser extent by strategic consulting  software licenses  mobile device activation fees and sales of telecommunication accessories 
strategic consulting consists primarily of fees charged for contract negotiations and bill audits 
contract negotiation fees include both fixed project fees and incentive fees driven by the amount of savings that we are able to generate over the customer existing communications rates 
these fees are recognized when fixed and determinable  usually when the customer and carrier execute the contract 
bill audit fees are driven by the amount of savings that we are able to generate by reviewing current and prior communications invoices against the customer existing contracts 
these fees are recognized when fixed and determinable  usually when the carrier agrees to issue a credit or refund to our customer 
on occasion  we license our communications management platform to our customers on a perpetual basis 
if we are able to derive vendor specific objective evidence on the undelivered elements  the software portion is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria is met  otherwise the contract is recognized ratably over the contract life 
other professional services are recognized as the services are performed 
we have an agreement with a carrier whereby we receive an activation fee for 
table of contents procuring a mobile device 
the activation revenue is recognized upon confirmation from the carrier that the device has been procured 
the revenue related to the sale of telecommunication accessories is recognized upon shipment of the accessories to the customer 
we expect our strategic consulting  software licenses and other revenue to remain relatively constant in absolute dollars  but to decrease as a percentage of total revenue  as we continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts on our recurring technology and services revenue model 
we historically have derived substantially all of our revenue from united states based customers 
we intend to build our international sales operations by increasing our direct sales force abroad 
we expect our international revenue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue 
cost of revenue and gross profit cost of recurring technology and services revenue 
cost of recurring technology and services revenue consists primarily of costs associated with our data center operations  customer product support centers and client services group 
this includes personnel related costs such as salary  stock based compensation and other compensation related costs  subcontractor fees  hosting fees  communications costs and royalties related to third party software included in our solution when our solution is licensed on a non perpetual basis 
cost of strategic consulting  software licenses and other revenue 
cost of strategic consulting  software licenses and other revenue consists primarily of personnel related costs  including salary  stock based compensation and other compensation related costs and subcontractor fees directly related to delivering the service and to a lesser extent  the cost of the telecommunications accessories sold 
as our customer base continues to grow  we expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our data center and customer support operations to support our continued growth 
our cost of revenue could fluctuate as a percentage of revenue on a quarterly basis but remain relatively stable on an annual basis based on the mix of software and services sold and average contractual selling price 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue is affected by two main factors the mix of software and services sold and the average contractual selling price 
we expect our gross profit in absolute dollars to increase  but that our gross profit as a percentage of revenue will be affected as we integrate the businesses of our recent acquisitions  which have historically operated with lower margins than our business 
we believe that over time we will achieve improvements in those margins as we integrate the acquired operations and capture the operating efficiencies of the overall business 
operating expense operating expense consists of sales and marketing  general and administrative  research and development and depreciation and amortization 
other than for depreciation and amortization expense  personnel related costs are the most significant component of all of these operating expenses 
we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees in order to support our overall growth 
in any particular period  the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating results  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel related costs  including salary  stock based compensation and other compensation related costs for our sales  marketing and business development employees  the cost of marketing programs such as on line lead generation  promotional events  such as trade shows  seminars and webinars  the cost of business development programs and sales commissions 
sales commission rates are calculated at the time a contract is signed 
the sales commission rate is applied to the contract first year of revenue to 
table of contents calculate sales commission expense 
sales commission expense is accrued and expensed at the time we invoice the customer and is paid to the salesperson when the invoice is collected 
generally  new sales personnel require time to become familiar with our software and services and do not begin to generate sales immediately  which can result in increased sales and marketing expense without any immediate increase in revenue 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars  but remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue in the near term  as we continue to hire sales and marketing personnel in the united states and internationally to expand our solution globally 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists of personnel related costs  including salary  stock based compensation and other compensation related costs for finance and accounting  executive  human resources and information technology personnel  rent and facility costs  legal and other professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
we are incurring and will continue to incur costs associated with being a public company  including corporate insurance costs as well as certain personnel costs and professional fees  including legal and accounting fees as they relate to financial reporting and maintaining compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we expect general and administrative expense to remain at approximately its current level in the near term and to decrease as a percentage of revenue 
research and development 
research and development expense primarily consists of personnel related costs  including salary  stock based compensation and other compensation related costs for development personnel  and fees to our outside contract development vendors 
we anticipate that our research and development team will continue to focus on expanding our software and services and increasing the functionality of our current offerings 
we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars  but that the investment will likely be lower than the rate of growth in our revenue in the near term 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense primarily consists of the non cash write down of tangible and intangible assets over their expected economic lives 
we expect this expense to continue to grow in absolute dollars and potentially as a percentage of revenue as we continue to grow and incur capital expenditures to improve our technological infrastructure and acquire assets through potential future acquisitions 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest expense on our short and long term debt  interest income on our cash and cash equivalents balance and changes in fair value of warrant to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we have historically invested our cash in money market investments 
we expect our interest income to vary in each reporting period depending on our average cash balances and interest rates 
income tax provision income tax provision consists of federal and state corporate income taxes resulting from our operations in the united states 
we expect income tax expense to vary each reporting period depending upon taxable income fluctuations and our availability of tax benefits from net loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which  if unused  expire from to  and us federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire through we have engaged in several transactions since our inception that have resulted in a change in control as defined by section of the internal revenue code  which limits our ability to utilize these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future 
as of december   million of our net operating 
table of contents loss and tax credit carryforwards were so limited 
at december   we recorded a valuation allowance against the full amount of our deferred tax assets  as our management believes it is uncertain that they will be fully realized 
if we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards  an adjustment to our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are summarized below 
see note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
recurring technology and services revenue consists of subscription based fees  software subscription license fees  software maintenance fees and hosting fees related to the use of our solution to manage our customers communications expenses 
strategic consulting  software licenses and other revenue consists of fees for perpetual software licenses  professional services  contract negotiations and bill audits 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery or performance of service has occurred 
recurring technology and services subscription based fees  software subscription license fees  software maintenance fees and hosting fees are recognized ratably over the term of the period of service 
the subscription based services we provide include help desk  asset procurement and provisioning  and carrier dispute resolution services 
implementation fees associated with recurring technology and services engagements are recognized ratably over the estimated expected life of the customer relationship which is estimated to be equal to twice the contract life 
software license fees consist of fees paid for a perpetual license agreement for our technology  which are recognized in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  software revenue recognition  as amended 
when contracts contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by the authoritative guidance 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance and support is established by a stated renewal rate included in the license arrangement or rates charged for stand alone sales of maintenance and support 
if software maintenance fees are provided for in the license fee or at a discount pursuant to a license agreement  a portion of the license fee equal to the fair market value of these amounts is allocated to software maintenance revenue based on the value established by independent sales of such maintenance services to customers 
professional services related to the implementation of our software products  which we refer to as consulting services  are generally performed on a fixed fee basis under separate service arrangements 
consulting services revenue is recognized as the services are performed by measuring progress towards completion based upon either costs or the achievement of certain milestones 
we also provide contract negotiation and bill audit services  which we refer to as strategic sourcing services  on behalf of our customers  which are generally performed on a contingency fee basis  with our fees being based on a percentage of the savings we achieve for the customer 
revenue from strategic sourcing services engagements is recognized as savings are secured for the customer  based upon the amount of savings secured multiplied by the contingency fee percentage to which we are entitled 

table of contents in accordance with asc  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses  we classify reimbursed expenses as revenue and the related expense within cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december   and reimbursed expenses of   and  respectively  were included in revenue 
purchase accounting 
we accounted for the acquisitions of hcl ems  telwares  profitline  anomalous  ttmobiles and symphony using the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions 
as a result  the purchase price for each of the transactions has been or will be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
we applied significant judgment and estimates in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and their useful lives 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets and liabilities was assigned to goodwill  which is not amortized for accounting purposes  but is subject to testing for impairment annually and more frequently if certain events occur 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates that we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur impairment charges 
software development costs 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we evaluate the establishment of technological feasibility of our software in accordance with asc  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we have concluded that technological feasibility is not established until the development stage of the software is nearly complete 
the time period during which costs could be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general release is very short and  consequently  the amounts that could be capitalized are not material to our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we charge all such costs to research and development in the period incurred 
impairment of goodwill 
as required by asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events 
we have one reporting unit 
the annual goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
first  we determine if the carrying value of its related reporting unit exceeds fair value  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount to determine if there is an impairment loss 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu  which amends asc for testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not  the entity is then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test otherwise  no further analysis is required 
an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  proceed directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
we have determined that goodwill was not impaired as of december  
table of contents impairment of other long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of these assets  or the need to accelerate amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our long lived assets and other intangibles 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the assets should be reviewed to determine their fair value 
we assess the assets for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset carrying amount over its fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on a valuation process that provides an estimate of a fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model  which includes many assumptions and estimates 
once the valuation is determined  we will write down these assets to their determined fair value  if necessary 
any write down could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we have determined that our long lived assets including intangible assets were not impaired as of december  stock based compensation 
we follow asc  share based payment for recording stock based compensation 
asc supersedes accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
asc requires all stock based compensation to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable service period 
we estimate the fair value of the stock based awards  including stock options  using the black scholes valuation model 
determining the fair value of stock based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the award and expected stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards granted in  and are set forth below expected dividend yield risk free interest rate to to to expected term in years years years years expected volatility the assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock based awards represent management best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation could be materially different in the future 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on a us treasury instrument with a term similar to the expected term of the stock based award 
the expected term of options has been estimated utilizing the vesting period of the option  the contractual life of the option and our option exercise history 
because there had been no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering  we believe that we have insufficient data from our limited public trading history to appropriately utilize company specific historical and implied volatility information 
therefore  we estimate our expected stock volatility based on that of publicly traded peer companies  and we expect to continue to use this methodology until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our publicly traded stock price 
also  asc requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
accordingly  we have estimated expected forfeitures of stock options upon the adoption of asc based on our historical forfeiture rate and used these rates in developing a future forfeiture rate 
if our actual forfeiture rate varies from our historical rates and estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
common stock warrant 
we accounted for the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant that we issued to ibm in accordance with asc  equity based payments to non employee 

table of contents we issued the warrant to ibm in connection with the entry into a five year strategic relationship agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  certain shares of common stock underlying the warrant vested at the time the agreement was signed  which we valued using the black scholes valuation model at the time of the signing of the agreement and recorded the amount to equity and to intangible assets 
additional shares of common stock underlying the warrant were set to vest based on the achievement of specified contractual billing thresholds over a three year period 
in june  we amended the terms of the warrant to change the number of shares that were subject to vesting and the thresholds for achieving vesting 
under the terms of the amendment  certain shares of common stock underlying the warrant vested at the time the amendment was signed 
these shares were valued using the black scholes valuation model based on inputs as of the time of the signing of the amendment 
additional shares of common stock underlying the warrant were set to vest based on the achievement of specified contractual annual recurring revenue thresholds over a period from june  to june  as of june   the vesting terms of the amended agreement expired with ibm earning no additional warrant shares 
as a result  no further warrants shares are issuable under this warrant agreement 
in the first quarter of  we began to amortize the asset  with the related charge recorded as contra revenue 
the related charge to revenue was in proportion to expected revenue from the agreement 
preferred stock warrants 
in connection with our acquisition of traq and various financing arrangements  we issued warrants to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in accordance with asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity  we classified these warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet  and each reporting period the carrying value of the warrants was adjusted to its then current fair value  with any resulting gain or loss reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of increase in fair value of warrants for redeemable convertible preferred stock 
as a result of our initial public offering  all warrants to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock became exercisable for shares of common stock 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states  and we use estimates in determining our income tax provisions 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized  and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against substantially all our deferred tax assets 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment that is subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
we assess all material positions taken in any income tax return  including all significant uncertain positions  in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities 
assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of each balance sheet date  unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed  and we will determine whether i the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and ii the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate 
the recognition and 
table of contents measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment 
judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available 
allowances for bad debt 
we estimate and record allowances for potential bad debts and customer credits based on factors such as the write off percentages  the current business environment and known concerns within our accounts receivable balances 
the allowance for bad debts is our estimate of bad debt expense that could result from the inability or refusal of our customers to pay for our services 
additions to the estimated allowance for bad debts are recorded as an increase in general and administrative expense and are based on factors such as historical write off percentages  the current business environment and the known concerns within the current aging of accounts receivable 
reductions in the estimated allowance for bad debts due to subsequent cash recoveries are recorded as a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
as specific bad debts are identified  they are written off against the previously established estimated allowance for bad debts and have no impact on operating expenses 
this allowance also includes our estimate of adjustments for services that do not meet our customers requirements 
additions to the estimated allowance for customer credits are recorded as a reduction in revenue and are based on a customer by customer basis of known concerns within the current aging 
reductions in the estimated allowance for customer credits are recorded as an increase in revenue 
as specific customer credits are identified  they are written off against the previously established estimated allowance for customer credits and have no impact on revenue 
if there is a decline in the general economic environment that negatively affects the financial condition of our customers or an increase in the number of customers that are dissatisfied with our software or services  additional estimated allowances for bad debts and customer credits may be required and the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with codification subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other  general intangibles other than goodwill 
the amendments in this asu are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
we elected early adoption of this update and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates as well as  to a lesser extent  inflation 
we may also face exchange rate risk in the future  as we expand our business internationally 
interest rate risk at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
these amounts were held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in deposits and money market funds 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
foreign exchange risk we sell our solution worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are currently denominated primarily in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and our accounts receivable more difficult to collect 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may  however  hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
inflation risk inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business  and we do not expect that they will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
however  the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment  cost of revenue and operating expenses  especially employee compensation costs  may not be readily recoverable in the pricing of our offerings
