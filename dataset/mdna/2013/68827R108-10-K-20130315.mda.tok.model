these statements  like all statements in this report  speak only as of the date of this report unless another date is indicated  and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future developments 
the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for each of the three years in the period ended december  and significant factors that could affect our prospective financial condition and results of operations 
you should read this discussion together with our financial statements and notes included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
business overview we are a leading stem cell company headquartered in columbia  maryland and focused on developing and marketing products to treat medical conditions in the inflammatory  cardiovascular  orthopedic and wound healing markets 
we currently market and distribute grafix and ovation for tissue repair 
our pipeline of internally developed biologic drug candidates under evaluation includes prochymal for inflammatory  autoimmune and cardiovascular indications  as well as chondrogen for arthritis in the knee 
we believe our stem cell products have significant therapeutic potential because of their ability to regulate inflammation  promote tissue regeneration and prevent pathological scar formation 
we began operations on december  and were a delaware corporation until  with approval of our stockholders  we reincorporated as a maryland corporation on may  we have two business segments  therapeutics and biosurgery 
our therapeutics business is focused on developing biologic stem cell drug candidates from a readily available and non controversial source adult bone marrow 
our biosurgery business  created in and operating as a separate segment since  works to harness the ability of cells and novel constructs to promote the body natural healing with the goals of improving surgical outcomes and offering better treatment options for patients and physicians 

table of contents we believe cellular therapies have certain advantages over traditional medical approaches 
for example  cell therapies can be targeted  avoiding many of the safety complications arising from systemic treatments 
cell therapies can also be responsive to their environment  turning on or off certain effects as conditions in the surrounding tissue change 
cell therapies can also be multifaceted 
for example  the cells in prochymal  our leading biologic drug candidate  have demonstrated the ability to not only downregulate inflammation  but also to promote repair of the damage caused by the inflammation 
we believe the combination of these unique properties will allow us to solve many of the more challenging questions facing medicine today 
we have established ourselves as an industry leader in the emerging field of cell therapy  having developed the first commercially available stem cell product 
we are a fully integrated company  having developed capabilities in research  development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of stem cell products 
we have developed an extensive intellectual property portfolio to protect our technology in the united states and a number of foreign countries  including us and foreign patents owned or licensed 
we believe that our biologic drug candidates have advantages over other stem cell therapeutics in development for at least the following reasons stem cell source 
our stem cells are obtained from adult bone marrow  a readily available source 
the cells are drawn from the hips of volunteer donors between the ages of and years  using a simple needle and syringe aspiration 
because the cells are obtained from consenting adult donors  we are able to largely avoid the ethical controversy surrounding embryonic and fetal stem cell research 
ability to mass produce 
through our proprietary manufacturing methods  we can grow mesenchymal stem cells msc in a controlled fashion to produce up to  treatments of our biologic drug candidates from a single bone marrow donation 
our ability to produce a large quantity of treatments from one donation provides us with manufacturing efficiencies and product consistency that are essential to commercialization 
universal compatibility 
many stem cell therapies under development can elicit a rejection response in the recipient and therefore require donor to recipient matching or potentially harmful immunosuppression 
this greatly reduces manufacturing efficiencies and creates a risk of mismatch which can result in an acute inflammatory response and  potentially  in death 
based on our clinical experience  we believe that our biologic drug candidates are not rejected by the patient immune system and so  like type o negative blood  do not require donor to recipient matching 
this universal compatibility allows us to produce a standardized product available to all patients in almost any medical setting 
treatment on demand 
our biologic drug candidates can be stored frozen at end user medical facilities until they are needed 
we anticipate that medical facilities will be able to prescribe and dispense these products in much the same way as conventional drugs 
in contrast  other stem cell technologies under development require weeks to prepare after a patient need is identified 
this is a key feature of our technology  as many patients in the critical care setting require prompt treatment 
in the third fiscal quarter of  we created our biosurgery segment focused on developing  manufacturing and distributing high end biologic products for use in surgical procedures 
we launched our first biologic product during third quarter of fiscal  and our biosurgery business has continued to grow since that time 
we anticipate continuing to increase our organizational focus on the development and commercialization of products in this segment as the revenues generated from bisourgery products increase in the foreseeable future 

table of contents financial operations overview revenue biosurgery segment 
beginning in fiscal  we started to account for our biosurgery business as a separate segment 
we manufacture human tissue based products in our columbia  maryland facility and distribute these products through a network of independent distributors as well as employee sales personnel 
we presently manufacture and distribute grafix for the treatment of chronic wounds and burns and ovation for orthopedic surgeries 
both of these products are cryo preserved and stored in special freezers at degrees celsius 
customers have the product shipped to them in dry ice 
legal title passes to the customer when the product leaves our shipping dock 
due to the nature of the products and the manufacturing process  we do not allow sales returns 
we launched our first biosurgery product for limited commercial distribution during the third quarter of we began distribution of a second biosurgery product in early fiscal  and have continued to increase our distribution volume throughout fiscal and  both through in house personnel as well as through our expanding distributor network 
the increase in revenue and gross profit since commercial launch is due to volume increases 
we anticipate continuing to increase our organizational focus on the development and commercialization of products in this segment in the foreseeable future 
therapeutics segment 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genzyme corporation  then an independent and now a sanofi company  for the development and commercialization of prochymal and chondrogen 
under the terms of the agreement  we retained the rights to commercialize prochymal and chondrogen in the united states and canada  and genzyme was granted exclusive rights to commercialize prochymal and chondrogen in all other countries  except with respect to gvhd in japan  where prochymal has previously been licensed to jcr pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
under the agreement  we were paid million for these rights 
during the fiscal quarter ended march  we recognized revenue of million  which was the final deferred revenue associated with the million upfront payment 
we recognized million of revenue from the amortization of the upfront payment during each of the fiscal year and the collaboration agreement provided that it would expire upon the completion of all development plans stipulated in the agreement and the expiration of all payment obligations  however  in addition to certain opt out rights  genzyme could terminate the agreement early and without further obligation at any time  and either party could terminate the agreement due to non performance  material breach or insolvency 
in february  sanofi issued a press release which included an update on their r d pipeline  stating that it had discontinued its project with prochymal for gvhd  and in september  we entered into a termination agreement with sanofi that terminated the collaboration agreement and memorialized an amicable parting 
under the termination agreement  neither party has any continuing financial or other obligations to the other 
we continue to proceed with our prochymal regulatory and commercialization efforts 
in  we also partnered with genzyme to develop prochymal as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
in the first quarter of  we were awarded a contract from the united states department of defense dod pursuant to which we  in partnership with genzyme  sought to develop and stockpile prochymal for the repair of gastrointestinal injury resulting from acute radiation exposure 
under the terms of this contract  we recognized  in revenue in fiscal no work is continuing under this contract and we are not presently pursuing other government contracts in partnership with genzyme  or otherwise 
in prior years  we entered into strategic agreements with other companies for the development and commercialization of prochymal for specific indications and geographic markets 
in  we entered 
table of contents into a collaborative agreement with the juvenile diabetes research foundation jdrf to conduct a phase clinical trial evaluating prochymal as a treatment for type diabetes mellitus 
this collaborative agreement provided for jdrf to provide million of contingent milestone funding to support the development of prochymal for the preservation of insulin production in patients with newly diagnosed type diabetes mellitus 
the contingent milestone payments under the agreement have been amortized into revenue on a straight line basis over the duration of our obligations under the collaborative agreement as they were earned 
as of december   we had achieved all million of the milestones available under the contract and recognized the entire funding as revenue 
in fiscal  we recognized  in revenue and in fiscal  we recognized million in revenue 
we recognized no revenue in connection with this project in  and although we continue to follow patients who participated in the studies supported by this arrangement  our work is substantially complete 
in  we entered into an agreement with jcr pharmaceuticals  granting it exclusive rights to prochymal for the treatment of gvhd and other hematological malignancies in japan 
during the first quarter of  we achieved a million milestone from jcr for development progress in japan 
the collaboration with jcr also provides for additional milestone payments of up to million for regulatory and sales milestones  as well as royalty payments on sales of the drug in japan 
research and development costs our research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing biologic drug candidates and biologic tissue based products 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs of contract research and manufacturing  costs of facilities  and the costs of manufacturing clinical batches of biologic drug candidates  quality control supplies and material to expand biologic drug candidates 
consistent with our focus on the development of biologic drug candidates with potential uses in multiple indications  many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified product 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects 
accordingly  we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
from inception in december through december   we incurred aggregate research and development costs of approximately million 
beginning in  with the creation of our biosurgery segment  we began to separately track research and development costs by segment 
research and development expenses for our therapeutics segment were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
biosurgery research and development expenses for the comparable periods were million  million  and million  respectively  which includes costs incurred for the study designed to allow for the collection of data necessary to obtain the permanent hcpcs q codes that began during the second fiscal quarter of as described above  we do not track internal development costs by project 
we do  however  track external research and development costs on a project basis 
during  we incurred million in external research and development costs on our acute myocardial infarction clinical trial  million for the diabetic foot ulcer trial for our biosurgery segment   on our refractory crohn disease clinical trial   on treatment resistant gvhd and  on smaller projects 
during fiscal  we incurred million in external research and development costs on our acute myocardial infarction clinical trial  million on our refractory crohn disease clinical trial   on treatment resistant gvhd and  on smaller projects 
for  our external research and development costs were approximately million for prochymal to treat first line and steroid refractory acute gvhd   for prochymal to treat crohn disease  million for prochymal to 
table of contents repair heart tissue following a heart attack  million for prochymal for the protection of pancreatic islet cells in patients with type diabetes   for prochymal to treat copd  and approximately  for smaller projects 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to be substantial in the future  as we continue our clinical trial activity for our existing biologic drug candidates as they advance through the development cycle  and as we invest in additional product opportunities and research programs 
clinical trials and preclinical studies are time consuming and expensive 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to many uncertainties 
we test our products in several preclinical studies  and we then conduct clinical trials for those biologic drug candidates that we determine to be the most promising 
as we obtain results from clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay trials for some biologic drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising biologic drug candidates 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  size of trial and intended use of a biologic drug candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the number of sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the duration of patient treatment and follow up  the costs of producing supplies of the biologic drug candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the efficacy and safety profile of the biologic drug candidate  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
as a result of these uncertainties  we are unable to determine with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our biologic drug candidates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with our general management  including salaries  allocations of facilities and related costs  and professional fees such as legal and accounting expenses 
generally  we have experienced a decrease in general and administrative costs as the result of our continued cost cutting efforts and the refinement of many of our general business processes  as well as a reduction in share based compensation expense 
beginning in fiscal  we incurred additional general and administrative expenses related to increased distribution efforts for our biosurgery products 
we expect future expense increases to continue as a result of hiring additional operational  financial  accounting  facilities engineering and information systems personnel as we continue to increase distribution of our biosurgery products and approach the commercial launch of prochymal for an initial indication 
other income  net other income consists of interest earned on our cash and investments available for sale and realized gains and losses incurred on the sale of these investments 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on capital leases 
we do not expect to incur material interest expense in the future as we do not have a material amount of equipment under capital lease or any outstanding debt 

table of contents income taxes until fiscal  we have not recognized any net deferred tax assets or liabilities in our financial statements since we cannot assure their future realization 
because realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  a full valuation allowance has been recorded on the net deferred tax assets  which relate primarily to net operating loss and research and development carry forwards 
in the event that we become profitable within the next several years  we have net deferred tax assets before a valuation allowance of approximately million that may be utilized prior to us having to recognize any income tax expense or make payments to the taxing authorities other than the alternative minimum tax 
the income from the upfront fees we received from genzyme corporation was required to be recognized over several years from through for financial statement reporting purposes 
for income tax purposes  the income was required to be fully recognized in and this resulted in our releasing million of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in fiscal we recognized million of the resulting deferred tax asset in  and recognized the remaining million deferred tax asset in in fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes to recognize the us federal alternative minimum tax on our taxable income 
in fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  to recognize a true up of the payables account that was identified when we filed our federal income tax return 
the effective tax rate of  as compared to a us statutory rate of  reflects this adjustment 
we do not expect to be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax in fiscal the tax provision for reflects an effective tax rate for continuing operations of compared to a us statutory tax rate of 
the effective tax rate reflects our estimated annual effective tax rate  which reflects our expectation that a portion of our income will be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax in  which is almost entirely offset by a release of valuation allowance discussed above 
in fiscal we recognized an income tax benefit of  in connection with truing up our tax asset accounts in connection with the filing of our income tax returns 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  deferred tax assets  share based compensation  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition as discussed in note segment reporting below  in we began operations of our biosurgery segment  focused on developing high end biologic products for use in wound healing and surgical procedures 
we commenced the manufacturing of our first biosurgery product  grafix  a regenerative wound care product  during the first quarter of during the first and second quarters of  we distributed the product only for initial clinical evaluation 
we launched the product for limited commercial distribution during the third quarter of we began distribution of a second biosurgery 
table of contents product  ovation in early fiscal  and continued to increase our distribution volume throughout fiscal and we recognized revenues of million and million on distribution of our biosurgery products in and  respectively  compared to  subsequent to commercial launch in fiscal we recognize revenue on the distribution of our biosurgery products when we ship the frozen product to our customers 
legal title passes to the customers when the product leaves our shipping dock 
due to the nature of the products and the manufacturing process  we do not allow sales returns or refunds 
to date  our therapeutics segment has generated revenues primarily from collaborative agreements and research licenses 
we evaluate revenues from agreements that have multiple elements to determine whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
to recognize a delivered item in a multiple element arrangement  the delivered items must have value on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance must be probable and within our control for any delivered items that have a right of return 
the determination of whether multiple elements of a collaboration agreement meet the criteria for separate units of accounting requires us to exercise judgment 
revenues from research licenses are recognized as earned upon either the incurring of reimbursable expenses directly related to the particular research plan or the completion of certain development milestones as defined within the terms of the agreement 
payments received in advance of research performance are designated as deferred revenue 
non refundable upfront license fees and certain other related fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the development periods of the contract deliverables 
fees associated with substantive at risk performance based milestones are recognized as revenue upon their completion  as defined in the respective agreements 
incidental assignment of technology rights is recognized as revenue as it is earned and received 
in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genzyme corporation  then an independent and now a sanofi company genzyme  for the development and commercialization of our biologic drug candidates  prochymal and chondrogen 
under this agreement  genzyme made non contingent  non refundable cash payments to us  totaling million 
the agreement provided genzyme with certain rights to intellectual property developed by us  and required that we continue to perform certain development work related to the subject biologic drug candidates 
in february  sanofi issued a press release which included an update on their r d pipeline  stating that it had discontinued its project with prochymal for gvhd 
in september  we reached agreement with sanofi to conclude the collaboration agreement without either party having any continuing obligation to the other 
we are continuing to proceed with our prochymal regulatory approval and commercialization efforts 
we evaluated the deliverables related to the upfront payments made to us under the genzyme collaboration agreement  and concluded that the various deliverables represent a single unit of accounting 
for this reason  we deferred the recognition of revenue related to the upfront payments  and amortized these amounts to revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated delivery period of the required development services  which extended through january accordingly  we recognized million of revenue from this agreement during  all of which came during the first fiscal quarter corresponding with the estimated end point date in january of  compared to million of revenue in each of the years ended december  and related to the amortization of the upfront payments 
in  we also partnered with genzyme to develop prochymal as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
in january  we were awarded a contract from the united states department of defense dod pursuant to which we sought  in partnership with genzyme  to develop and stockpile prochymal for the repair of gastrointestinal injury resulting 
table of contents from acute radiation exposure 
we began recognizing revenue under this contract in  and completed our work under the contract during contract revenue was recognized as the related costs were incurred  in accordance with the terms of the contract 
we recognized approximately  in revenue from the dod contract during we have not recognized any revenue associated with this contract during fiscal or  and the agreement with genzyme expired in july in october  we entered into a collaborative agreement with the juvenile diabetes research foundation jdrf to conduct a phase clinical trial evaluating prochymal as a treatment for type diabetes mellitus 
this collaborative agreement provides for jdrf to provide up to million of contingent milestone funding to support the development of prochymal for the preservation of insulin production in patients with newly diagnosed type diabetes mellitus 
the contingent milestone payments under the agreement are amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the duration of our obligations under the collaborative agreement as they are received and earned 
we have received all million of the contingent milestones  and amortized the funding received over the duration of our obligations 
we completed the majority of our work under this contract in fiscal  resulting in million in revenue during compared to million of revenue during we have not recognized any revenue associated with this contract during fiscal  but are continuing to monitor the trial participants through early fiscal we have also entered into strategic agreements with other pharmaceutical companies focusing on the development and commercialization of our stem cell drug candidates 
for example  in  we entered into an agreement with jcr pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
jcr pertaining to hematologic malignancies gvhd drugs for distribution in japan 
under such agreements  we receive fees for licensing the use of our technology 
we recognized million of revenue during the first fiscal quarter of from jcr upon the achievement of a milestone event specified in the agreement 
our therapeutics segment also earns royalty revenues and cost reimbursement under our adult expanded access program 
royalties are earned on the sale of human mesenchymal stem cells sold for research purposes 
we recognize this revenue as sales are made 
revenues include approximately  of royalty revenue in   of royalty revenue in and  of royalty revenue in revenues also include approximately   and  in cost reimbursement for prochymal used in our adult expanded access program during   and  respectively 
investments available for sale and other comprehensive income investments available for sale consist primarily of marketable securities with maturities less than one year 
investments available for sale are valued at their fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
all realized gains and losses on our investments available for sale are recognized in results of operations as investment income  a component of other income expense  net 
investments available for sale are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management reviews criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  as well as the reasons for the decline  to predict whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
if a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value 
we charge off uncollectible receivables when the likelihood of collection is remote 
we set credit terms with individual customers  and consider receivables outstanding longer than the time specified in the respective customer contract  typically days  to be past due 
as of december  and  accounts receivable in 
table of contents the accompanying balance sheet are reported net of a  and a  allowance for doubtful accounts  respectively 
we believe the reported amounts are fully collectible 
accounts receivable balances are not collateralized 
we have incurred bad debt expense of  and  related to our biosurgery operations during fiscal and  respectively  and no bad debts expense during the year ended december  inventory we commenced limited distribution of our biosurgery products during the third quarter of  and began carrying inventory on our balance sheet thereafter 
inventory consists of raw materials  biologic products in process  and products available for distribution 
we determine our inventory values using the first in  first out method 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  and excludes units that we anticipate distributing for clinical evaluation 
we do not currently carry any inventory for our therapeutics products  as we have yet to launch prochymal for commercial distribution following its approval in canada during the second quarter of  and subsequent approval in new zealand 
historically  our therapeutics segment operations have focused on clinical trials and discovery efforts  and accordingly  manufactured clinical doses of our drug candidates were expensed as incurred  consistent with our accounting for all other research and development costs 
once we begin commercial distribution  all newly manufactured prochymal doses will be allocated either for use in commercial distribution  which will be carried as inventory and not expensed  or for research and development efforts  which will continue to be expensed as incurred 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of assets 
fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted cash flows 
the discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk 
there were no impairment losses recognized during the fiscal years  or research and development costs we expense internal and external research and development r d costs  including costs of funded r d arrangements and the manufacture of clinical batches of our biologic drug candidates used in clinical trials  in the period incurred 
beginning in  with the creation of our biosurgery segment  we began to separately track research and development costs by segment 
research and development expenses for our therapeutics segment were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
biosurgery research and development expenses for the comparable periods were million  million  and million  respectively  which includes costs incurred for the study designed to allow for the collection of data necessary to obtain the permanent hcpcs q codes that began during the second fiscal quarter of as described above  we do not track internal development costs by project 
we do  however  track external research and development costs on a project basis 
during  we incurred million in 
table of contents external research and development costs on our acute myocardial infarction clinical trial  million for the diabetic foot ulcer trial for our biosurgery segment   on our refractory crohn disease clinical trial   on treatment resistant gvhd and  on smaller projects 
during fiscal  we incurred million in external research and development costs on our acute myocardial infarction clinical trial  million on our refractory crohn disease clinical trial   on treatment resistant gvhd and  on smaller projects 
for  our external research and development costs were approximately million for prochymal to treat first line and steroid refractory acute gvhd   for prochymal to treat crohn disease  million for prochymal to repair heart tissue following a heart attack  million for prochymal for the protection of pancreatic islet cells in patients with type diabetes   for prochymal to treat copd  and approximately  for smaller projects 
income taxes deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences  income tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
temporary differences are primarily the result of the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting values 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured by applying the enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or realized 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense  if any  consists of the taxes payable for the current period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recorded as income tax expense 
at december  and  we had no accruals for interest or penalties related to income tax matters 
share based compensation we account for share based payments using the fair value method 
we recognize all share based payments to employees and non employee directors in our financial statements based on their grant date fair values  calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
compensation expense related to share based awards is recognized on a straight line basis based on the value of share awards that are expected to vest during the requisite service period on the grant date  which is revised for forfeitures 
results of operations year ended december  compared to december  biosurgery product revenues gross profit during fiscal  we continued to expand our distribution efforts in our biosurgery segment  both through in house personnel as well as through our expanding distributor network 
during fiscal  we recognized million of product revenues from the distribution of grafix and ovation and realized gross profit of million  compared to million of product revenues and  of gross profit during the increase in revenue and gross profit in is due to volume increases  as we have continued to expand our distribution network 
we are continuing to distribute a substantial amount of these products for clinical evaluation and expect commercial distribution to ramp up slowly until such time as we are able to build the commercial capabilities necessary to drive more widespread adoption 
until such time as we ramp up our biosurgery manufacturing activities to fully utilize our manufacturing facilities  our costs to manufacture these products are likely to vary significantly 

table of contents realized gross profits represent of revenues during fiscal compared to of revenues during fiscal we anticipate continuing to increase our organizational focus on the development and commercialization of products in this segment in the foreseeable future 
revenues from collaborative research agreements  government contract and royalties revenues from collaborative research agreements and royalties were million for fiscal  compared to million for the fiscal we recognized the final million in revenue from our collaborative agreement with genzyme during january  and over the course of the year recognized approximately  of royalty revenues and approximately  in cost reimbursement under our adult expanded access program 
all of the revenue from the jdrf collaboration had been recognized prior to revenues for fiscal included million in revenue from the collaborative agreement with genzyme   from our collaboration with jdrf   from our compassionate use protocol for treatment resistant gvhd in adults and  in royalties 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for were million as compared to research and development expenses of million for  as follows year ended december  therapeutics biosurgery the decrease in research and development expenses in our therapeutics segment reflects lower expenses in our acute myocardial infarction clinical trial  which was fully enrolled in the third quarter of  resulting in lower patient and site costs since then and reduced activity in our crohn disease clinical trial 
the increase in research and development expenses in our biosurgery segment in fiscal reflects our increased process improvement efforts and development expenses incurred in exploring additional products to bring to market and the enrollment of the clinical trial required to obtain cost reimbursement for grafix 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses during fiscal were million compared to million during fiscal we incurred million of sales  general and administrative expenses related to our biosurgery segment during  compared to  in the increase in our biosurgery related general and administrative expenses reflects the additional sales  marketing and commission expenses incurred as we increase our distribution efforts 
general and administrative expenses incurred in our therapeutics segment during fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal the decrease is the result of our continued cost cutting efforts and the refinement of many of our general business processes  as well as our increased focus of internal resources on our biosurgery operations 
other income  net other income  net consists of our net realized investment income earned on our investments available for sale 
other income  net was  during fiscal and  during fiscal the decrease between years reflects the reductions in our investments available for sale to fund our operations combined with the very low yields offered on investment grade securities during fiscal

this transaction was approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting 
non employee members of our board of directors are compensated by an annual award of stock that is paid in either unrestricted shares of our common stock or cash  or a combination of stock and cash 
during fiscal  we issued  shares of common stock and paid  cash to our non employee directors 
during fiscal  we issued  shares of common stock and paid  cash to these individuals

research and development expenses research and development expenses during fiscal were million compared to million during fiscal  as follows year ended december  therapeutics biosurgery 
table of contents the decline in therapeutics r d expenses during fiscal of approximately million is principally related to the completion of the majority of patient treatment costs in our phase cardiac trial  while the decline in biosurgery r d is primarily attributable to the high volume of product development costs incurred for that segment in fiscal as we prepared for commercial launch

in addition  we have not had any outstanding debt at any time since fiscal during the fiscal year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities for the first time since our inception  as a result of the million portion of the up front fees received under the collaboration agreement with genzyme 
we generated a further million of cash in up front fees during fiscal we used a portion of these proceeds to completely extinguish our debt during  and have since consistently made purchases of investments available for sale with our excess cash 
we have used these receipts to fund our operations since fiscal with the commercial launch of our biosurgery products  we have begun to generate cash from product revenues 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity on hand as of december  to fund our operations through such time as our biosurgery operations become cash flow positive and or we begin to generate cash from our first biological drug candidate

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and results of our research and preclinical development programs  the scope and results of our clinical trials  particularly regarding the number of patients required for our phase trials  the timing of and the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our biologic drug candidates  which could be more lengthy or complex than obtaining approval for a new conventional drug  given the fda limited experience with late stage clinical trials and marketing approval for stem cell therapeutics  the costs of maintaining  expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio  including possible litigation costs and liabilities  and the costs of enlarging our work force consistent with expanding our business and operations and distribution of our biosurgery products and if approved for sale  our biological drug product 
we did not have any outstanding debt at any time during as a result of our financial position and forecasts as of december   we believe that we have sufficient liquidity on hand as of that date to fund our operations through such time as our biosurgery operations become cash flow positive and or we begin to generate cash from our first biological drug candidate 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and we have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations at december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based on the terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of item under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and certain assumptions 
future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts 
payment due by fiscal year contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years amounts in thousands operating lease facilities capital lease obligations contract research organizations total contractual cash obligations contract research organizations 
we contract with independent contract research organizations  or cros  to perform many of the tasks required under our clinical trials of our biological drug candidates  and we utilize their testing expertise to ensure the objectivity of the clinical results 
under the terms of these agreements  we design the protocol regarding the testing to be performed  and the cro assists in the enrollment of the patients and testing sites  administers the trial  performs statistical analysis of the results  and compiles the final report 
we pay fees directly to the cros for their professional services  which may be payable upon specified trial milestones or as they provide services  depending on the structure of the contract 
we are also responsible for reimbursing the cros for certain pass thru expenses they incur in administering the trial 
the timing of our payments to the cros is dependent upon the progress of the various trials  which is highly variable dependent upon the speed with which the cros are able to enroll patients and testing sites 
as such  we are unable to specifically predict the timing of future payments to cros 
as of december   we had active contracts with cros related to three on going clinical trials which were in varying stages of completion 
the total contracted payments to cros under these agreements were million  of which we had incurred approximately million as of that date 
although we cannot directly control the timing of the remaining payments  based on our estimates and assumptions as of december   we expect to pay million of our remaining obligations to these cros during and the remainder in leases 
during  we entered into a sublease agreement for approximately  square feet of laboratory  production  warehouse and office space in columbia  maryland 
we have also entered into a direct lease with the owner of this facility that was effective as of june  upon the expiration of the sublease and expires in july during  following the expiration of the sublease agreement  we increased an outstanding letter of credit  which was used in lieu of a security deposit for this lease  to  according to the terms of the direct lease with the owner of the facility 
at each of july    and  the security deposit required under this lease decreased to   and  respectively 
we reduced our outstanding letter of credit 
table of contents accordingly  and the reduced letter of credit of  remained outstanding as of december   and has been fully collateralized by restricted cash 
effect of inflation 
inflation and changing prices are not generally a material factor affecting our business 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and lease costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk due to the short duration of our investment portfolio and the high quality of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any material degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
we believe that the interest rate risk related to our accounts receivable is not significant 
we manage the risk associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value for non collectability and establishment of appropriate allowances in connection with our internal controls and policies 
foreign current exchange rate risk we conduct clinical trial activities in areas that operate in a functional currency other than the united states dollar usd 
as a result  when the usd rises and falls against the functional currencies of these other nations  our costs will either increase or decrease by the relative change in the exchange rate 
foreign currency gains and losses were not material during the three years ended december   and at the present time  we have elected not to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
derivative instruments we do not enter into hedging or derivative instrument arrangements
