overview ultra petroleum corp 
is an independent exploration and production company focused on developing its long life natural gas reserves in the green river basin of wyoming the pinedale and jonah fields and is in the early exploration and development stages in the appalachian basin of pennsylvania 
the company operates in one industry segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development  with one geographical segment  the united states 
the company currently conducts operations exclusively in the united states 
substantially all of its oil and natural gas activities are conducted jointly with others and  accordingly  amounts presented reflect only the company s proportionate interest in such activities 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company continues to focus on improving its drilling and production results through gaining efficiencies with the use of advanced technologies  detailed technical analysis of its properties and leveraging its experience into improved operational efficiencies 
inflation is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company currently generates its revenue  earnings and cash flow primarily from the production and sales of natural gas and condensate from its properties in southwest wyoming with an increasing portion of the company s revenues coming from gas sales from wells located in the appalachian basin in pennsylvania 
part of the company s business strategy includes proactive and regular review of its portfolio of investment opportunities with a focus on investments that produce positive returns 
accordingly  in response to the current low natural gas price environment during  the company reduced its net capital investments from billion in to million in by releasing all but two of its operated drilling rigs in wyoming and reducing drilling activity in pennsylvania 
the price of natural gas is a critical factor to the company s business and the price of natural gas has declined significantly since the beginning of during  the company limited the impact of these low prices on its results by entering into swap agreements and or fixed price forward physical delivery contracts for natural gas 
the average price realization for the company s natural gas during was per mcf  including realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives 
during the quarter ended december   the average price realization for the company s natural gas was per mcf  including realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives 
the company s average price realization for natural gas  excluding realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives  was per mcf and per mcf for the year and quarter ended december   respectively 
because of the company s belief that overall domestic natural gas supply will decline and natural gas forward prices will increase in response  the company has not hedged any of its forecast natural gas production 
see note 
mission and strategy ultra s mission is to profitably grow an upstream oil and gas company for the long term benefit of its shareholders 
ultra s strategy includes building a robust portfolio of high return investment opportunities  maintaining a disciplined approach to capital investment  maximizing earnings and cash flows by controlling costs and maintaining financial flexibility 
consistent with this mission and strategy  the company significantly reduced its activity during as a result of the low prevailing natural gas prices during as a result of this reduced activity  the number of wells drilled and completed by the company was lower in than in some 
table of contents prior years 
in addition  as a result of the low gas prices  the company was required to record a billion non cash  ceiling test write down of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties  and the company s proved reserves were reduced to tcfe at december  from tcfe at december  for additional information about steps the company is taking to address low natural gas prices  see the marketing and pricing section of item business 
because dry natural gas drilling activities were significantly reduced by most oil and gas operators during  the company expects natural gas supply to decline 
as a result  the company believes the current low natural gas prices are unsustainable  and the company expects natural gas prices to improve over the next two years 
if natural gas prices recover as the company expects  the company should be able to restore its proved undeveloped reserves to at least prior prevailing levels 
the reduction in proved reserves reflected in the year end report is not the result of any change in the geologic prospectivity of the company s properties 
as required by sec regulations  the company used a calculated weighted average natural gas sales price of per mcf and per mcf for estimating its proved reserves at december  and  respectively 
the lower gas price for the reserves negatively impacted the company in two ways 
first  some of its proved reserves are uneconomic at the sec gas price 
second  some of its proved undeveloped reserves were reclassified as unproven properties in because the sec gas price reduced capital available for the company to drill its proved undeveloped properties 
high return portfolio 
ultra seeks to maintain a portfolio of properties that provide long term  profitable growth through development in areas that support sustainable  lower risk  repeatable  high return drilling projects 
the company continually evaluates opportunities for the acquisition  exploration and development of additional oil and natural gas properties that afford risk adjusted returns in excess of or equal to its current set of investment alternatives 
disciplined capital investment 
part of the company s business strategy includes proactive and regular review of its portfolio of investment opportunities with a focus on investments that produce positive returns in order to optimize return to its shareholders 
accordingly  in response to the current low natural gas price environment  the company reduced capital expenditures by reducing the number of drilling rigs operating in its wyoming fields  and the company is encouraging the parties operating projects on its behalf in pennsylvania to reduce their activity as well 
reductions in the company s activity resulted in reduced capital spending during the current year as compared to the prior year 
low cost producer 
ultra strives to maintain one of the lowest cost structures in the industry in terms of both adding and producing oil and natural gas reserves 
the company continues to focus on improving its drilling and production results through the use of advanced technologies and detailed technical analysis of its properties 
financial flexibility 
preserving financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet are also strategic to ultra s business philosophy 
maintaining financial discipline enables the company to capitalize on the flexibility of its portfolio 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in addition  application of gaap requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates related to judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
set forth below is a discussion of the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which we believe involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 

table of contents oil and gas reserves 
the reserve estimates presented herein were made in accordance with oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure authoritative accounting guidance according to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  extractive activities oil and gas fasb asc as updated in order to align the reserve calculation and disclosure requirements with those in sec release no 
the company utilizes reliable technology such as seismic data and interpretation  wireline formation tests  geophysical logs and core data to assess its resources 
however  none of these technologies have contributed to a material addition to the proved reserves in this report 
the proved reserves estimates are prepared by netherland  sewell associates  inc  an independent  third party engineering firm 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the company s dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves may result from a number of factors including lower prices  evaluation of additional operating history  mechanical problems on our wells and catastrophic events 
lower prices also make it uneconomical to drill wells or produce from fields with high operating costs 
the company s proved reserves are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate materially from actual results 
as a result  the estimates of proved reserves could vary over time  and could vary from actual results 
full cost method of accounting 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities as defined by sec release no 
and fasb asc under the full cost method of accounting  all costs associated with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized on a country by country basis 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and natural gas properties for each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method 
changes in estimates of proved reserves  future development costs or asset retirement obligations are accounted for prospectively in our depletion calculation 
under the full cost method  costs of unevaluated properties and major development projects expected to require significant future costs may be excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
the company excludes significant costs until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
excluded costs  if any  are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
write down of oil and gas properties 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed quarterly  on a country by country basis  utilizing the average of prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding twelve month period 
the ceiling limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved crude oil and natural gas reserves discounted at plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in a lower dd a rate in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the calculation of the ceiling test is based upon estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  in projecting the future rates of production and in the timing of development activities 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of 
table of contents available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
during  the company recorded a billion non cash write down of the carrying value of the company s proved oil and gas properties as a result of ceiling test limitations  which is reflected with ceiling test and other impairments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the ceiling test was calculated based upon the average of quoted market prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding twelve month period at december   september  and june  of per mmbtu  per mmbtu and per mmbtu for henry hub natural gas  respectively  and per barrel  per barrel and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  respectively  adjusted for market differentials 
the company did not have any write downs related to the full cost ceiling limitation in or asset retirement obligation 
the company s asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and natural gas properties 
fasb asc topic  asset retirement and environmental obligations fasb asc requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and natural gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted  risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  the company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized costs  including revisions thereto  are charged to expense through dd a 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales 
the company generally sells natural gas and condensate under both long term and short term agreements at prevailing market prices and under multi year contracts that provide for a fixed price of oil and natural gas 
the company recognizes revenues when the oil and natural gas is delivered  which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  prices are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company accounts for oil and natural gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon the company s ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether it has taken its ownership share of such volumes 
the company records a receivable or a liability to the extent it receives less or more than its share of the volumes and related revenue 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between the company and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
the company prefers the entitlements method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales because it allows for recognition of revenue based on its actual share of jointly owned production  results in better matching of revenue with related operating expenses  and provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis temporary differences 
to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences 
table of contents become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
as a result of the tax effect of the ceiling test and other impairments recorded during the year ended december   the company s previously recorded net deferred tax liability fully reversed into a net deferred tax asset 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset balance of million as of december  this valuation allowance may be reversed in future periods against future taxable income 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company follows fasb asc topic  derivatives and hedging fasb asc 
the company records the fair value of its commodity derivatives as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets  and records the changes in the fair value of its commodity derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations as an unrealized gain or loss on commodity derivatives 
fair value measurements 
the company follows fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures fasb asc 
under fasb asc  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at measurement date and establishes a three level hierarchy for measuring fair value 
the valuation assumptions the company has used to measure the fair value of its commodity derivatives were observable inputs based on market data obtained from independent sources and are considered level inputs quoted prices for similar assets  liabilities adjusted and market corroborated inputs 
at december   the company did not have any open commodity derivative contracts 
see note for additional information 
in consideration of counterparty credit risk  the company assessed the possibility of whether each counterparty to the derivative would default by failing to make any contractually required payments as scheduled in the derivative instrument in determining the fair value 
additionally  the company considers that it is of substantial credit quality and has the financial resources and willingness to meet its potential repayment obligations associated with the derivative transactions 
the company recognized impairments of million during the year ended december  related to the decline in fair value as defined in fasb asc as a result of forecast decreased throughput volumes on its gathering facilities in pennsylvania due to the decline in commodity prices 
these facilities are included in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets and were impaired to a fair value of million based on the income approach  estimated using level fair value inputs 
legal  environmental and other contingencies 
a provision for legal  environmental and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determines when the company should record losses for these items based on information available to the company 
share based payment arrangements 
the company follows fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation fasb asc which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values 
share based compensation expense recognized under fasb asc for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
see note for additional information 

table of contents conversion of barrels of oil to mcfe of gas 
the company converts bbls of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons to mcfe at a ratio of one bbl of oil or liquids to six mcfe 
this conversion ratio  which is typically used in the oil and gas industry  represents the approximate energy equivalent of a barrel of oil or other liquids to an mcf of natural gas 
the sales price of one bbl of oil or liquids has been much higher than the sales price of six mcf of natural gas over the last several years  so a six to one conversion ratio does not represent the economic equivalency of six mcf of natural gas to a bbl of oil or other liquids 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 which amends fasb asc the amended guidance clarifies many requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
additionally  the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the guidance provided in asu no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

operating activities 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  a decrease from billion for the same period in the decrease in net cash 
table of contents provided by operating activities was largely attributable to decreased revenues resulting from decreased natural gas prices during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in investing activities 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million as compared to billion for the same period in the decrease in net cash used in investing activities is largely related to decreased capital investments associated with the company s drilling activities in as compared to and proceeds from the sale of the lgs during december financing activities 
during the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the same period in the change in cash used in net financing activities is primarily due to decreased borrowings during as compared to outlook we believe we are well positioned for the current economic environment because of our status as a low cost operator in the industry combined with our financial flexibility 
in  the company established new production records while maintaining a low cost structure 
the company s low cost structure contributes to the company s long term favorable returns and growth profile 
although our net cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by continued low natural gas prices  and although we have not hedged any of our production because we expect natural gas prices to improve over the next two years  we believe that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations  which  along with our available cash  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our capital investments and operations over the next twelve months 
we continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of reduced commodity prices in order to determine the appropriate size and nature of our capital investment program

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk objectives and strategy the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is currently driven primarily by the prevailing price for the company s wyoming natural gas production 
historically  prices received for natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
pricing volatility is expected to continue 
historically  the company has entered into various types of derivative transactions to manage its exposure to commodity price risk and to provide a level of certainty in the company s forward cash flows supporting the company s capital investment program 
a significant portion of our revenues during  and was attributable to these derivative transactions 
because forward natural gas prices for production were very low during  the company has not hedged any of its forecast natural gas production 
as a result of the company not having hedged any of its production  its earnings and cash flow may be more volatile during than in prior years 
the company s hedging policy limits the amounts of resources hedged to not more than of its forecast production without board approval 
as a result of its hedging activities  the company may realize prices that are less than or greater than the spot prices that it would have received otherwise 
fair value of commodity derivatives fasb asc requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and be measured at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the income statement 
unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives represent the non cash change in the fair value of these derivative instruments and do not impact operating cash flows on the cash flow statement 
the following table summarizes the pre tax realized and unrealized gains and losses the company recognized related to its natural gas derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  natural gas commodity derivatives realized gain on commodity derivatives unrealized loss gain on commodity derivatives total gain on commodity derivatives included in gain on commodity derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations
