this section provides information necessary to evaluate our ability to generate cash and to meet existing and known future cash requirements over both the short and long term 
references to   and refer to the week periods ended december   january   and january  overview the company we are trusted by the world leading organizations to help build and advance their reputations through expert management and flawless execution of critical communications 
we are building a portfolio of solutions to address the changing business landscape for our primary markets  as we help companies migrate from paper based to digital processes through innovative tools to manage the entire lifecycle of their documents from concept to delivery 
the company is now in its fourth year of its evolution from a product focused company to a market focused innovator 
while performance improvement over the past three years had been evident  management entered knowing it needed to accelerate the turnaround 
therefore  in january of  the company announced a major restructuring and workforce reduction to accelerate the company transition  reduce costs  and align resources around core solutions 
as a direct result of these measures  as well as the growing success of our technology oriented solutions  we saw our financial performance improve during the year 
our business challenges advances in on demand technologies have accelerated the adoption of electronic distribution of documents and digital printing  therefore reducing the market for longer run traditional business forms  a legacy product offering of the company 
in addition  the downturn in the economy and turmoil in the credit markets in recent years have created highly competitive conditions in an already over supplied  price competitive industry 
macro trends are affecting our traditional printing business  but we have maintained strong customer relationships 
we are taking substantial measures to transform our company to be leaders in our primary markets and believe our success is dependent upon continuing to address the following challenges transformation of our portfolio of solutions future pension funding requirements and amortization of actuarial gains and losses generating positive cash flow transformation of our portfolio of solutions traditional business documents and information driven processes are essential in order to conduct business 
however  many printed documents and related services are being replaced or commoditized by advances in digital technologies  causing significant price pressures and steady declines in demand for a large portion of our legacy product line 
the same digital advances also introduce new opportunities with significant growth potential for us  such as on demand publishing and solutions that assist customers in their transition to digital business environments 
these growth opportunities are particularly enhanced due to our extensive history and experience 
at the end of  we began the process of evolving into a market focused innovator  beginning the transformation from a product driven company to one focused on providing and developing new solutions for growth and durability for the key markets we serve 
key to the transformation was our investment in new digital color equipment and technology 
the investment supports our strategy for growth in core marketing solutions by helping our customers manage their brand through effective color execution and increased security and efficiency in their critical communications 
optimization of our manufacturing footprint and implementation of new workflow and print technology in our print on demand centers were important steps operationally 
we transformed five of our regional print centers into super centers  equipping each with high speed  high quality color printing  and in line finishing and bindery capabilities 
in addition  the regional centers and our three largest satellite facilities were upgraded with the latest high speed  monochrome printing equipment as well as wide format printers 
advances in production were complemented by new digital workflow technology  which was rolled out across our entire digital print network 
the software allows web based orders to move from customer desktops through the production process with minimal intervention 
it automatically routes orders to the print center most convenient to the customer  which dramatically improves fulfillment times and reduces freight costs for the customer 
we also made strategic acquisitions 
in  we purchased the assets of fusion graphics  inc  consisting of patented in mold label products and intellectual property  including the grafilm in mold labeling system 
the acquisition allows us to serve a much broader group of customers worldwide and continue to develop new products for our industrial customers 
in  we acquired dialog medical  a company that provides solutions for managing the patient informed consent process 
the acquisition strengthens and broadens our leadership in the healthcare market  complements our portfolio of solutions  and enhances our ability to continue to advance our core growth products in the healthcare market 
as a result of these investments  we expect to be able to grow and develop innovative solutions  specifically in the areas of patient identification and safety solutions  secure document solutions  marketing and customer communication solutions  and in mold labeling 
these solutions address important business needs and better position us for future growth 
we believe our extensive expertise within our markets combined with our continued focus on targeted solutions for those markets will differentiate us from our competitors and will continue to produce growth opportunities outside of our legacy solutions 
as demand for legacy transactional print products declines  the expansion of our market share in our core solutions will be a key factor to our success 
future pension funding and loss amortization during   and most recently in and  our qualified pension plan became underfunded due to weak stock market returns and historically low long term interest rates 
the amortization of these actuarial losses has resulted in significant pension loss amortization in recent years million in  million in  and million in we expect this trend to continue and that pension loss amortization will continue to materially impact our operating profit in future years 
based upon current estimates  we project pension loss amortization to be million in due to the high degree of variability and uncertainty regarding the assumptions used to determine these amounts  actual results could differ significantly from those expected 
the pension protection act of became effective in and increased the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plan 
in response to the weak economic conditions  the pension relief act of pra was passed in the pra provided funding relief specifically for plan years by allowing plan sponsors to stretch out funding over a longer period of time for two of those years 
funding relief was also provided by the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map  commonly referred to as the highway bill 
map provides pension plan sponsors with funding relief by stabilizing interest rates used to determine required funding contributions to defined benefit plans 
the new legislation allows the use of a year average corporate bond rate adjusted to the applicable corridor rather than a year average rate as required under the prior law to calculate funding requirements 
the internal revenue service irs will determine the year average rates on an annual basis and may prescribe equivalent rates for any years in the year period for which segment rates determined under the regular rules are not available 
based upon the new requirements and current estimates  our minimum funding requirement will be million in and million in we made million of excess contributions in that will be applied to meet our funding requirement 
our estimates of minimum funding requirements are also dependent upon investment return and interest rate assumptions that have a high degree of variability and uncertainty  as evidenced in the recent economic climate 
unexpected gains or losses in asset values or changes in factors affecting interest rates could materially impact the actual required contributions 
although benefits under the majority of our pension plans have been frozen  settlement of our pension obligations will still present uncertainty and variability in our financial results in future years  with the ultimate outcome determined by actual asset performance in our qualified plan  interest rates  and the level of our pension contributions 
generating positive cash flow transforming our product portfolio and funding our pension plan creates additional challenges related to generating and maintaining positive cash flow due to the significant cash investments required 
pricing pressures in our legacy product line as these products are further commoditized create additional pressures on cash 
our core solutions generally generate higher profit margins  therefore  our continued shift from legacy to core solutions will help offset these pressures 
we continue to undertake aggressive actions to accelerate our transition  reduce costs  and align resources around our core solutions business 
significant restructuring actions have been implemented to improve our cost structure  most recently in the restructuring plan is expected to reduce costs by approximately million annually  when fully implemented  and allow us to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund near term operations and growth initiatives 
additionally  due to the lack of a statutory surplus required under ohio law  we suspended our dividend  which results in the retention of approximately million of capital annually 
our focus building on our success in  our priorities continue to center around our customers and operational and profit improvement 
our focus remains on acquiring new customers  defending and expanding current business  and optimizing our cost structure 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that could have a material effect on the reported amount of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available  and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are described throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions discussed below for the pension plan  goodwill  and deferred taxes generally do not affect segment results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pension benefit plan assumptions included in our financial statements are significant pension obligations and benefit costs which are measured using actuarial valuations 
the use of actuarial models requires us to make certain assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
such assumptions include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in addition  the actuarial calculation includes subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences can have a significant impact on the amount of pension obligations and benefit expense recorded in future periods 
we periodically review the assumptions used to account for our pension benefit plans 
discount rate one of the principal components of calculating the projected benefit obligation is the assumed discount rate  which is the assumed rate at which future pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate established at year end for the benefit obligations is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit cost for the following year 
discount rates are established based on prevailing market rates for high quality  fixed income instruments with maturities equal to the future cash flows to pay the benefit obligations when due 
at december   we used a percent discount rate  which compares to percent at the end of a future increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligations  thus changing the funded status of our pension plans 
to illustrate the sensitivity of pension liabilities to changes in the discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  a one percent increase in the discount rate applied to our qualified pension plan would reduce the liability by approximately million  and in turn improve the funding status of the plan 
conversely  a one percent decrease in the discount rate applied to our qualified pension plan would increase the liability by approximately million  increasing the under funded status of the plan 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets one of the principal components of the net periodic pension cost calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on plan assets can result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term rate of return is designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by our employees 
our qualified defined benefit pension plan assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of publicly traded common stocks  commingled debt and equity funds  and various hedge funds 
we use long term historical actual return experience and estimates of future long term investment return  with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan assets  to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in the net periodic pension cost calculation 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the pension cost calculation over five years using a five year  market related asset value method of amortization 
the amortization of these differences has  and will continue to have  a significant effect on net periodic pension cost 
for and  we used an percent expected long term rate of return  which is lower than the percent used in a future decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase net periodic pension cost for the period and vice versa 
to illustrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the long term rate of return  holding all other assumptions constant  a one percent decrease in the rate would increase pension expense by approximately million 
our non qualified pension benefit plans are unfunded plans and have no plan assets 
therefore  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is not a factor in accounting for these benefit plans 
mortality rates one of the assumptions made in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation is an estimate of mortality rates for the population of pension participants 
our actuaries use mortality tables  which include death rates for each age  in estimating the amount of pension benefits that will become payable 
we use the rp mortality table to determine benefit obligations and to determine pension benefit cost 
goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization 
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units in the second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the annual impairment test is a two step process 
the first step in the impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of the assets assigned to those reporting units  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  step two is completed to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
to determine fair value for each reporting unit  we follow an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology 
this approach requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  and future economic and market conditions 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
though we believe our assumptions are reasonable  actual results could be different from those assumed in our forecasts 
key assumptions used in our fair value calculations include revenue and cost assumptions we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows which are based on both historical information and our most recent view of the long term outlook for each reporting unit derived from the company current strategic plan 
we calculate multiple outcomes which are weighted to arrive at an overall projected cash flow 
discount rate determination we use an industry weighted average cost of capital that reflects the weighted average return on debt and equity of our peer group from a market participant perspective 
as an alternative  we are permitted to first use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment if certain conditions are met 
however  we determined that it was not appropriate to use this approach for the current year due to continuing changes in our business  current restructuring activities  and recent changes to our reporting units 
therefore  the test was performed using the two step approach described above 
the results of our impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are greater than their carrying value and no goodwill impairment is indicated 
in addition to calculating a range of possible outcomes  sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the relative impact of the key assumptions used in our calculations 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower  or there was a variation in the discount rate  the expected future cash flows would still have exceeded the carrying value of the assets  including goodwill 
deferred taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and mexico 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  and our provision for income taxes  including tax positions taken or to be taken in our tax returns 
we review the potential future tax benefits of all deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company evaluates all positive and negative evidence regarding the potential realization of the company deferred tax assets when determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
based on cumulative losses in recent years  defined as the current and two preceding years and recent actuarial pension losses  a valuation allowance is maintained against the entire us net deferred tax asset except for million related to the pension liability 
we are forecasting that the pension liability will be reduced by future actuarial gains prior to funding the related liability  therefore  the deferred tax asset will be realized without the need for future taxable income 
because of the cumulative losses in recent years  the company is not relying on forecasts of future taxable income to realize any us deferred tax assets 
the amount of our deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could change if our estimates of business results or future taxable income change 
we also have a canadian capital loss carryforward that has an indefinite carryforward period 
a full valuation allowance has been provided for the tax benefit associated with this capital loss as it is more likely than not that this capital loss will not be utilized 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates 
since the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted  changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
as the economic recovery continues to be sluggish and as issues of debt reduction  global competitiveness  and job creation dominate the national discussion  there is pressure for congress to lower the corporate rate 
if enacted  the effect of a change in corporate tax rates on our tax expense and deferred taxes would be dependent on the amount of our tax valuation allowance at that time 
share based compensation the amount of share based compensation expense recognized for our performance based stock awards requires us  among other things  to evaluate the probability of achieving performance goals and assess the level of goal achievement each reporting period 
while the assumptions used to calculate compensation expense recognized for these awards represent our best estimate at that time  these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment 
if performance targets are not achieved  all  or a portion  of the shares awarded are forfeited and the related compensation expense is reversed 
the final amount of compensation expense recorded for these types of awards is currently dependent on management estimate of the company financial performance over a period of time  which could vary from actual results achieved 
compensation expense could vary based on changes in our expectations and the actual level of achievement of the performance goals 
environmental remediation we are currently involved in the remediation of two environmental sites that are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with accounting standards for environmental liabilities  we have recorded an estimate of the total costs to remediate these sites 
however  due to the lengthy nature in settling environmental obligations and the fact that final remedies have not been agreed upon  determining total costs requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
areas requiring the most significant judgments and estimates include the extent and timing of final remediation actions and the estimation of our share of the final remedy 
due to the complexity of environmental issues  monitoring costs can extend for many years 
we must also estimate all costs related to the final remedy  which frequently involves complex procedures that can vary significantly from original plans depending on actual conditions encountered on the site 
until final remediation approaches are approved and final agreements are reached among all prps  it is reasonably possible that one or more of these factors could change our estimates  however  we are unable to determine the impact at this time 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as software  professional services  and ongoing maintenance and post contract customer support 
we account for the licensing of software arrangements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards for software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could change the timing or amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as custom printed products  warehousing services  and custom delivery services 
for these types of arrangements  we are required to use a hierarchy to allocate the total consideration to each element in the arrangement 
the hierarchy requires the use of vsoe  third party evidence of selling price tpe  or best estimate of selling price besp 
vsoe represents the price of the deliverable when sold on a stand alone basis  while tpe represents the price that outside vendors charge on a stand alone basis 
besp is management best estimate of the selling price on a stand alone basis using available internal and external data and should be used only when vsoe or tpe cannot be established 
two of our deliverables  custom printed products and warehousing services  require the use of besp 
determining besp requires us to make judgments and assumptions regarding the value of these deliverables on a stand alone basis 
to determine besp  we consider internally generated data such as estimated costs for materials  labor  manufacturing and administrative costs  as well as external data such as observable pricing for similar products and current industry and competitive market conditions 
in addition  we consider product life cycle stages  profit margins  assumed volume activity levels  and typical agreement terms 
we routinely update  analyze  and weight this data based on the significance we believe each assumption bears on the selling prices we ultimately could charge 
as such  our determination of besp requires significant judgment 
changes in the assumptions utilized or judgments could change the timing or amount of revenue that we report in future periods 
results of operations the discussion that follows provides information which we believe is relevant to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations  supplemented by a discussion of segment results where appropriate 
consolidated results the following table presents non gaap net income  which is a non gaap financial measure and represents net income excluding pension loss amortization  pension settlements  postretirement plan termination  restructuring charges  and adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company performance  financial position  or cash flows where amounts are either excluded or included not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we believe that this non gaap financial measure provides a more complete understanding of our current underlying operating performance  a clearer comparison of current period results with past reports of financial performance  and greater transparency regarding information used by management in its decision making 
this presentation is similar to the manner in which our board of directors internally evaluates performance 
the following table reconciles our net loss income to net income presented on a non gaap basis 
change change revenue cost of sales gross margin gross margin of sales sg a expense pension settlements and postretirement plan termination restructuring other expense  net loss income before taxes income tax expense rate net loss income non gaap net income net loss income adjustments deferred tax valuation pension loss amortization pension settlements and postretirement plan termination restructuring and asset impairment tax effect of adjustments at statutory tax rates non gaap net income includes impairment recorded in other income in revenue the following table quantifies  on a percentage basis  the estimated impact of key factors that contribute to the increase or decrease in consolidated revenue percent change vs 
percent change vs 
units acquisitions price product mix total units acquisitions price product mix total the revenue decline is primarily due to the net unit decrease  driven by the decline in demand for our legacy products and related services 
as previously disclosed  we anticipated lower print and service related revenue in from a significant financial customer due to its major restructuring announced at the end of the pace of the decline accelerated in the last half of the year  bringing the total decline to million for  of which million was in legacy products and services and the balance in core solutions 
we anticipate lower revenue of approximately million from this customer in at the end of  approximately percent of our revenues came from legacy products  which are generally transactional documents and labels  clinical forms  and other printed materials that are in a state of transition to digital technologies or are being rapidly commoditized given the excess capacity in the printing industry 
together with the related service revenue  primarily warehousing and custom delivery services which are often bundled with the printed products  we experienced a percent revenue decline from legacy products in we expect this trend will continue in revenue growth comes from our core solutions  which are a suite of product and service solutions designed to assist our customers in meeting their strategic business needs 
however  the revenue growth in core solutions was also impacted by lower core revenue of million from the significant customer discussed above 
excluding this impact  core solutions revenue grew by percent in in  we focused on transforming our product portfolios and launching new solutions 
as the recovery in the economy has been slow  customers continued to focus on cost containment  resulting in pressure on price 
additionally  cost reduction initiatives implemented by our customers and the continued proliferation of technology drove declines in the use of certain legacy print products  as technology was utilized to reduce or eliminate the need for printed products 
these conditions led to accelerated rates of decline in our legacy products  particularly during the last half of as a result  overall declines in revenue in legacy print products offset progress made in our core solutions 
the acquisition of new customers  expansion of new business with existing customers  and an upward trend in order levels drove improvement in our unit sales during however  due to continued pressures on legacy print products  overall units declined 
the following table quantifies the changes in consolidated revenue by major categories and between core and legacy 
chg chg print labels software services other core legacy cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales decreased in  primarily due to lower unit sales volume 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased in  reflecting the impact of pricing pressures  particularly in legacy clinical paper documents and transactional forms and labels  declines in certain legacy product unit volume that had higher margins  and material cost increases 
this impact is being partially offset by savings from implemented cost saving initiatives and ongoing restructuring activities 
we are managing to the lower volume and executing on the restructuring program to reduce our cost structure 
in  the decrease in cost of sales was also primarily due to lower unit sales volume 
these decreases were offset partially by increases in price resulting from higher material costs  increased costs associated with newly acquired customers  and unabsorbed costs due to lower sales volume 
we realized savings from previously implemented cost reduction initiatives  which partially offset these increases 
as a result  the gross margin percentage declined slightly as compared with selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense in declined significantly from and levels 
sg a expense for was million  or percent lower than we are realizing significant savings from our current restructuring and cost reduction initiatives discussed below  primarily in compensation and employee related expenses  benefits  various fees and services  travel and entertainment  and facility costs 
sg a expense includes a credit of million in and million in from amortization of prior service credits that does not occur in due to the termination of our postretirement healthcare plan 
except for costs associated with our pension plans and environmental liabilities  the majority of sg a expense is allocated to our segments 
this reduction in expense is reflected in the operating income of our healthcare and business solutions segments 
amortization of pension actuarial losses increased to million in and million in over million in due to significant actuarial losses recorded in recent years that are required to be amortized in future periods 
based upon current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates  we project pension loss amortization to increase to million in we currently participate in the remediation of two environmental sites for which final remedies have not yet been determined 
total environmental costs included in sg a expense were million  million  and million in   and the company has participated with other potentially responsible parties prps in the investigation  study  and remediation of the pasco sanitary landfill superfund site the pasco site in eastern washington state since the company was a member of a prp group known as the industrial waste area generators group ii the iwag group  and as a result of arbitration  in september  the group entered into a new agreement creating the iwag group iii 
the new agreement changed the allocation of responsibility among the members  which resulted in a significant decrease in our obligation 
pension settlements and postretirement plan termination as a result of associates retiring and electing a lump sum payment of their pension benefit  we recorded non cash settlement charges of million  million  and million in   and related to our non qualified retirement plan 
a pension settlement charge is recorded when the total lump sum payments for a year exceed total service and interest costs recognized for that year 
the settlement charge recognizes a pro rata portion of the unrecognized actuarial losses at the date of the settlement 
in  we also terminated our postretirement healthcare plan and no longer offer medical benefits to currently retired employees 
the elimination of these benefits triggered a one time gain of million  of which million is included in the operating results of our segments 
because the elimination of these benefits reduced benefits previously earned  this action was treated as a negative plan amendment and eliminated the million accumulated postretirement benefit obligation remaining on the balance sheet 
the plan amendment also resulted in a net credit of million to net postretirement benefit cost for the immediate recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits and actuarial losses 
this credit was offset by an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred tax liabilities 
restructuring and other exit costs the company has undertaken cost reduction initiatives and restructuring actions as part of ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies  reduce costs  and maintain a strong financial condition 
we recorded million  million  and million of restructuring and other exit costs in   and related to these initiatives 
we intend to continue to critically evaluate operations and costs and may initiate additional cost reducing initiatives or restructurings in the future 
plans in late  we developed a strategic restructuring program that was announced in january the restructuring is a two year program designed to better align our resources in support of our growing core solutions business and to reduce costs to offset the impact of declining revenue in our legacy products 
we expanded our program into and also increased our anticipated savings from our projections at the end of when fully implemented at the end of  the restructuring program is expected to result in an estimated million of savings annually  of which million was realized in approximately percent of the savings will be in sg a expense and the remainder in cost of sales 
we also increased our original estimate of the total costs of the restructuring program due to planned infrastructure changes  information technology initiatives  and additional third party assistance with developing the restructuring program 
our current estimate of total costs is approximately million  the majority of which will result in cash expenditures 
employee separation costs associated with workforce reductions total million 
contract termination and other associated exit costs total million 
other associated exit costs include fees to a third party to assist with the program implementation  costs for the relocation of equipment and inventory  and certain costs related to implementation of an erp system that will replace select software applications 
all but million of the costs have already been recorded to restructuring expense 
completed restructuring plans restructuring and other exit costs also include costs from completed restructuring plans 
in  we launched a company wide review of business practices and growth acceleration opportunities designed around the priorities of client satisfaction  cost reduction  and increased market coverage 
as a result  we implemented a restructuring plan and numerous organizational improvements to simplify business  move closer to the customer  grow revenue  and improve overall efficiency of our business 
restructuring costs included severance related to workforce reductions  contract termination and other exit costs from the strategic closure of production and distribution facilities and the subsequent relocation of equipment and inventory  and fees to the third party that assisted with the development and implementation of the plan 
we do not expect any additional costs related to these plans 
income taxes a summarized reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate follows statutory federal income tax rate valuation allowance other effective tax rate the effective tax rate for was significantly impacted by an adjustment to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets except for approximately million related to the pension liability 
after evaluating all positive and negative evidence regarding the potential realization of our deferred tax assets  we concluded that a valuation allowance is necessary primarily based on cumulative losses in recent years and current year actuarial pension losses 
because of the cumulative losses in recent years  the company is not relying on forecasts of future taxable income to realize any us deferred tax assets 
because of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  there was no federal or state income based tax expense or benefit in tax expense for reflects foreign taxes in mexico and state tax liabilities derived from a tax base other than net income 
segment operating results management evaluates the results of its segments on the basis of operating income and excludes items listed in the reconciliation in note segment reporting of the notes to financial statements 
this non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
a complete description of our reportable segments is included in item  business 
since the january restructuring announcement  we analyzed our operations  organizational structure  and portfolio of products and services and  as a result  we combined the commercial markets  financial services  and industrial business units into one consolidated business unit  business solutions 
we re evaluated our reportable segments based upon the new management structure  our internal reporting  and how our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources 
as a result  we determined that the company now manages and reports its businesses in the following two reportable segments healthcare the healthcare segment serves hospitals and other providers of healthcare and related services 
the solutions portfolio includes marketing services  patient information solutions  and patient identification safety solutions 
legacy products are dominated by clinical documents and administrative forms 
business solutions the business solutions segment serves customers in the financial services  commercial  and industrial markets 
the solutions portfolio includes customer communications  marketing services  on demand publishing  and product marking labeling 
legacy products are dominated by traditional business documents and transactional labels 
we have revised our segment information for prior periods to conform to the current period presentation 
components of segment operating income production costs of our manufacturing and supply chain shared services functions are accumulated on a customer basis and reported in the applicable business unit cost of sales 
our business units incur a portion of selling  general and administrative expense directly 
each business unit also receives an allocation of sg a expense as follows each business unit has its own sales regions 
selling expense incurred by each sales region is allocated to other business units based on the percentage of revenue generated for the other business unit 
we use an activity based method to allocate expense associated with our client satisfaction function to business units 
finance  technology  and other corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated based on the business unit budgeted revenue as a percentage of actual consolidated revenue 
general and administrative expense of our remaining shared services is allocated based on a percentage of actual revenue

healthcare our healthcare segment serves hospitals and other providers of healthcare and related services 
this market is undergoing fundamental change as healthcare policy and advancing technologies are transforming how patient information is obtained and managed throughout the patient care process 
these factors  combined with legislative actions in the us  are leading to a shift from preprinted patient forms and records to electronic health records ehr  steadily reducing demand for our legacy print products while increasing demands for our digital document solutions and safety products 
in  the decline in revenue from our legacy print products accelerated as the year progressed  due to the accelerated adoption of ehr solutions in response to the incentives and penalties as proposed by the us government 
with our extensive expertise in healthcare  we are addressing the needs of our customers in this changing market by focusing on solutions that ease their transition to electronic medical records  enhance patient care and safety  and reduce their overall costs 
in  we acquired of the ownership interest in dialog medical which provides solutions for managing the patient informed consent process 
this acquisition strengthens and broadens our leadership in the healthcare market  complements our portfolio of solutions  and enhances our ability to continue to advance our core growth products in the healthcare market 
we believe we have an advantage due to our many years of experience working with hospitals  however  we face challenges in growing our core solutions more quickly

percent change vs 
units acquisitions price product mix total units acquisitions price product mix total healthcare revenue declined a total of million in and million in  primarily due to a net unit decrease in both years 
revenue from legacy products drove the decline  decreasing million or percent in  with a higher rate of decline experienced in the last half of the year 
this compares to a million or percent decline in as more hospitals progress into stages three and four of ehr adoption  we experience revenue decline in our legacy products  particularly in clinical paper documents and administrative forms 
including the related freight and storage services associated with these printed forms  revenue decreased million or percent in and million or percent in revenue from healthcare solutions  the segment technology oriented core portfolio of products and services which includes patient information  marketing communications  and wristband solutions  continues to grow from million in to million in and million in revenue from our patient information solutions is increasing  driven by new technology sales and the acquisition of dialog medical 
all of the revenue from software and software related services is part of this solution 
revenue from our wristband solutions included with labels showed a slight decline in following increased revenue in  while revenue from our marketing communication solutions showed modest increases in both and with hospitals focusing on ehr initiatives  we believe they may be behind in their adoption of digital solutions to their marketing needs  which provides opportunities for us 
the following table provides further insight into the changes in revenue by major categories 
chg chg print labels software services other core legacy operating income operating income for was down compared with  primarily the result of lower units and pricing 
operating income for was favorably impacted by million from an allocation of a portion of the gain from the termination of our postretirement healthcare plan 
excluding the postretirement gain  operating income in improved over the prior year 
operating income was down million in compared with due to lower gross margin on lower sales volume 
while operating income is being affected by the unit decline in legacy product revenue  growth in certain of our higher margin technology solutions and savings from the restructuring program and other cost savings initiatives in recent years are having a positive impact on operating income 
business solutions our business solutions segment primarily serves the needs of customers from the financial services  commercial  and industrial markets covering a broad spectrum of companies which include retail banks  insurance carriers  retailers  overnight delivery carriers  business service providers  and manufacturers 
while intense price competition and technological erosion in our traditional print products remains prevalent in this segment  we continue to develop our portfolio of solutions to address the changing needs of the markets served by business solutions 
the financial services market is one where advancing technologies and changing regulatory requirements continue to transform the products and services desired by our customers 
economic conditions in recent years particularly impacted financial services customers leading to consolidations within the industry  intense customer focus on cost reductions  and highly competitive conditions 
these factors also led to an increase in the adoption of digital technologies further impacting demand and prices for traditional print products 
the commercial market is also affected by digital advances 
customer adoption of digital technologies has reduced demand in traditional print products creating excess capacity and increased price competition  while at the same time creating new opportunities for on demand publishing and digital based products 
a strong correlation exists between the demand for most of our products and the economic conditions within the commercial market 
a slow economic recovery and high unemployment rates can have a negative impact on our customers  resulting in consolidations and divestitures as a means for them to control costs and create efficiencies 
the primary customers we serve in the industrial market are manufacturers of products directly affected by discretionary spending levels of consumers and products supporting the housing industry 
although manufacturing continues to show signs of expansion in the us  some industrial segments that we focus on have continued to show slow growth or declines  especially hvac  electrical distribution  and appliances

percent change vs 
units acquisitions price product mix total units acquisitions price product mix total business solutions revenue declined a total of million in  however  this decline was primarily due to a unit decrease from a significant customer 
as previously disclosed  we anticipated lower print and service related revenue in from a significant financial services customer due to its major restructuring announced at the end of the pace of the decline accelerated in the last half of the year  bringing the total decline to million for  of which approximately percent was in legacy products and services and the balance in core solutions 
we anticipate the decline to affect  particularly in the first half of the year  with approximately million in lower revenue from this customer in revenue from core solutions shows approximately a one percent decline in  reflecting lower core revenue from the significant customer discussed above 
excluding this impact  core solutions revenue grew by percent in we did experience a revenue decrease in our legacy products  which for this segment primarily includes specialized print such as traditional business forms and secure documents and certain transactional labels such as shipping and distribution labels 
including the related freight and storage services associated with these products  the overall decrease in revenue from legacy products was million in the biggest factor was lower revenue of million from the significant customer discussed above 
we saw positive effects from our go to market strategy in  however  we continued to see the effects of weak economic conditions and technology erosion which offset these gains and resulted in a net unit decline 
non repeat orders in marketing solutions  lost revenues from a few large customers  and reduced demand for legacy products drove the decline 
expansion of sales to existing customers and acquisition of new customers contributed to increases in our core print solutions in the upgrade of our digital print network was very evident in this segment as we posted solid growth for the year 
increases in revenue due to price resulted primarily from the pass through of material cost increases 
the following table provides further insight into the changes in revenue by major categories 
chg chg print labels software services other core legacy operating income operating income for increased compared with  despite the decline in revenue 
operating income for was favorably impacted by million from an allocation of a portion of the gain from the termination of our postretirement healthcare plan 
excluding the postretirement gain  operating income has improved significantly as savings from the restructuring program and other cost savings initiatives are having a positive impact 
operating income in was consistent with  however  included the postretirement gain mentioned above 
operating income for reflected higher costs as a result of material cost increases during the year  increased production costs related to newly acquired customers  and unabsorbed costs due to lower unit volume 
however  changes in product mix from some lower margin legacy products to higher margin core growth products and targeted cost reduction efforts combined to offset some of the higher costs 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity also presents a financial measure that is considered non gaap 
because our credit facility is borrowed under a revolving credit agreement which currently permits us to borrow and repay at will up to a balance of million subject to limitations related to receivables  inventories  and letters of credit  we measure cash flow performance prior to borrowing or repayment of the credit facility 
in effect  we evaluate cash flow as the change in net debt credit facility less cash and cash equivalents 
cash flows overall  cash flow on a net debt basis was positive by million in  compared to a negative million and million in and summarized statements of cash flows are presented below net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate on changes in cash net change in cash memo add back credit facility repaid borrowed cash flow on a net debt basis operating activities restructuring payments were much higher in than in and when previously initiated restructuring plans were winding down 
in january  we announced a restructuring program that when fully implemented is expected to result in an estimated million in annual savings 
total costs of the restructuring program are expected to be approximately million  of which million resulted in cash expenditures in contributions to the company s qualified pension plan were million in  of which million in excess contributions will be applied against the required amount for and lower our cash outlay 
this compares with million in and million in based on provisions of the highway reauthorization legislation signed into law in july  we updated our pension funding expectations for through we had originally expected required pension contributions for through to total million 
with relief provided by the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map  commonly referred to as the highway bill  we were able to reduce the required contribution amount to million for and expect to reduce the required amounts for and to million and million 
map provides pension plan sponsors with funding relief by stabilizing interest rates used to determine required funding contributions to defined benefit plans 
the new legislation allows the use of a year average corporate bond rate adjusted to the applicable corridor rather than a year average rate as required under the prior law to calculate funding requirements 
the internal revenue service irs will determine the year average rates on an annual basis and may prescribe equivalent rates for any years in the year period for which segment rates determined under the regular rules are not available 
map also includes an increase in future pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc premiums 
contributions made to supplementary pension plans for benefit payments made to participants were million  million  and million in   and investing activities net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by capital expenditures in   and in we made significant investments in our infrastructure and product portfolio  which included entering into several capital lease obligations for digital color equipment and technology 
the new investment supports our strategy for growth in core marketing solutions 
the capital lease obligations have remaining payments  including interest  of approximately million over the next four years 
in  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
we also invested in acquisitions totaling million and million in and in  we acquired of the ownership interest in dialog medical as an addition to our healthcare segment 
the total purchase price was million  of which million was paid in cash  the balance in the form of a note payable and contingent consideration based upon the achievement of certain revenue targets by the acquired business 
in  we purchased selected assets  primarily patents  of fusion graphics  inc for approximately million 
the purchase represents an important part of transforming our product portfolio specifically related to the in mold product line of our business solutions segment 
we expect to continue considering other acquisition opportunities that further expand and improve our product portfolio 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities increased in as the company made total payments of million on the credit facility and capital leases 
dividends of million paid in the first quarter of were the only payment made in the current year 
in january  we announced the suspension of our quarterly dividend in keeping with ohio law  which requires that cash dividends be paid only out of a corporation statutory surplus 
because of the decline in shareholder equity related to actuarial losses in our pension plan and the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets  there is not currently a statutory surplus 
with the acquisition of dialog medical in  we signed a note payable for million and expect to pay an additional million that is contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets by dialog medical over a two year period 
payments of million on these obligations were made in we have a million four year senior secured revolving credit facility credit facility with five banks that matures in the credit facility is secured by accounts receivable  inventories  fixed assets  and certain other assets 
the credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage covenant test that becomes applicable if the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances falls below of aggregate commitments or million  whichever is greater 
the credit facility provides for the payment of interest on amounts borrowed under london interbank offered rate libor contracts and base rate loans 
payment of interest on libor contracts is at an annual rate equal to the libor rate plus to based on our level of liquidity 
payment of interest on base rate loans is based on the prime rate plus to based upon our level of liquidity 
we are also required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
such fee is payable at an annual rate of basis points if the unused portion is equal to or less than of the aggregate commitment or basis points if the unused portion is greater than of the aggregate commitment 
at year end  we had million available under the credit facility 
we believe that the combination of our ability to generate cash and to borrow under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  including cash outlays for required pension contributions  capital expenditures  remaining restructuring payments  and investments in growth initiatives over the next year 
we believe our major long term cash requirements consist of funding our pension plan and necessary investments aimed at transforming our product portfolio 
while we have taken steps to enable us to adequately fund these items  actual amounts required may be higher than estimated due to the uncertainty in determining the exact amounts needed
