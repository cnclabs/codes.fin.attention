item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with  and we qualify our discussion in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere within this annual report on form k  the material contained under part  item description of business and part i  item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k  and the cautionary disclosure about forward looking statements at the front of part i of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets innovative  proprietary products for the treatment of voiding dysfunctions 
our primary focus is on two products the urgent pc neuromodulation system  which we believe is the only fda cleared minimally invasive  office based neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder oab and associated symptoms of urinary urgency  urinary frequency  and urge incontinence  and macroplastique implants a urethral bulking agent for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence primarily due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency isd 
outside of the us  our urgent pc system is also approved for treatment of fecal incontinence  and macroplastique is also approved for treatment of male stress incontinence  vocal cord rehabilitation and vesicoureteral reflux 
our sales have been significantly influenced by the availability of third party reimbursement for ptns treatments 
sales of our urgent pc system in the us grew rapidly during fiscal and with rapid market acceptance of ptns treatments that were reimbursed under a category current procedure technology cpt code 
sales declined from the first quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal  because of lower or unavailable reimbursement when the american medical association ama advised the providers that reimbursement for ptns treatments should be requested under an unlisted cpt code 
we responded by sponsoring several clinical studies over the following two years that were published in us peer review journals 
with favorable results from these studies  we applied for  and effective january the ama granted  a new category cpt code for ptns treatments 
as a result  we expanded our us field sales and support organization from employed sales representatives and six independent manufacturer s representatives on april  to employed sales representatives on march   and sales of our urgent pc system began to increase 
we have since focused our efforts on expanding reimbursement coverage with medicare carriers and private payers by instituting a comprehensive program to educate their medical directors regarding the clinical effectiveness  cost effectiveness and patient benefits of ptns treatments using our urgent pc system 
after a positive coverage decision by wisconsin physician services effective june   regional medicare carriers representing states and the district of columbia  with approximately million covered lives  provide coverage for ptns treatments 
in addition  we estimate that private payers insuring approximately million lives provide coverage for ptns treatments 
at june   one regional medicare carrier representing states  with approximately million covered lives  continued to decline reimbursement coverage for ptns treatments 

table of contents with the availability of a cpt category code and expanded reimbursement coverage from third party payers  as well as an expanded sales organization  sales of our urgent pc system in the us increased in the year ended march  over the year ended march   and continued this positive trend with a growth to million in the year ended march  overall  revenue growth slowed somewhat in the year ended march   as sales in the us of our more mature macroplastique product and sales outside of the us each declined 
we expect to continue to emphasize sales of our urgent pc system in the united states  and have retained new sales management to restructure our sales organization 
the intent is to increase our focus on training physicians on the continued use and benefits of a treatment regime using the urgent pc system for overactive bladder 
as part of this process  we intend to test the use of clinical support specialists in some of our markets 
we also have earmarked additional marketing dollars for the coming fiscal year to better introduce our products to both those members of the public most likely to require treatment with the device  and to key opinion leaders in the urology markets 
we do not expect to see significant growth in our us macroplastique business  because we believe it is a small  mature market that is more competitively penetrated than the market for oab treatment using ptns 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts  giving due consideration to materiality 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following can be characterized as critical accounting policies and are particularly important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial position 
these critical policies may require the application of a higher level of judgment by us  and as a result are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of ownership have passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we include in net sales shipping and handling charges that we bill to customers  and include the related shipping and handling costs that we incur in cost of goods sold 
we present our sales in our income statement net of taxes  such as sales  use  value added and certain excise taxes  collected from the customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
typically our agreements contain no customer acceptance provisions or installation obligations 
we sell our products to clinics  healthcare institutions  physicians and other healthcare providers  and to distributors 
the distributor payment terms are not contingent on the distributor selling the product to end users 
customers do not have the right to return unsold products except for warranty claims 
our distributors purchase our products to meet the sales demand of their end user customers as well as to fulfill their internal requirements associated with the sales process and  if applicable  contractual purchase requirements under the respective distribution agreements 
internal and other requirements include purchases of products for training  demonstration and evaluation purposes  clinical evaluations  product support  establishing inventories  and meeting minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  the level of our net sales during any period is not necessarily indicative of our distributors sales to end user customers during that period  which we estimate are not substantially different than our sales to those distributors in each of the last three years 
our distributors level of inventories of our products  their sales to end user customers and their internal product requirements may impact our future revenue growth 
accounts receivable 
we carry our accounts receivable at the original invoice amount less an estimated allowance for doubtful receivables based on a periodic review of all outstanding amounts  and less an estimated sales return allowance 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the customer s financial health  and both historical and expected credit loss experience 
we write off our accounts receivable when we deem them uncollectible 
we record recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off when received 
we are not always able to accurately or timely anticipate changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
we determine the sales return allowance based on historical experience 
historically  the accounts receivable balances we have written off and the sales returns have generally been within our expectations 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we provide lower of cost or market reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon current and expected future product sales and the expected impact of product transitions or modifications 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
while we expect our sales to grow  a reduction in sales could reduce the demand for our products and may require additional inventory reserves 
historically  inventories we have written off have generally been within our expectations 

table of contents foreign currency translation transactions 
the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  foreign currency matters 
we translate all assets and liabilities using period end exchange rates  and we translate statements of operations items using average exchange rates for the period 
we record the resulting translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses in the statement of operations  including unrealized gains and losses on short term intercompany obligations using period end exchange rates  resulting in an increase in the volatility of our consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we use judgment to forecast future cash flows including forecasting revenues and margins  and working capital needs 
if we consider such assets impaired  we measure the impairment to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we did not record any impairment charge in fiscal years  or share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation costs under asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
we recognize the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options and restricted shares  in our financial statements 
we measure that cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
defined benefit pension plans 
we have a liability attributed to defined benefit pension plans we offered to certain former and current employees of our subsidiaries in the uk and the netherlands 
the liability is dependent upon numerous factors  assumptions and estimates  and the continued benefit costs we incur may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate  mortality  compensation rates  or retirement dates used to determine the projected benefit obligation 
additionally  changes made to the provisions of the plans may impact current and future benefit costs 
in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation retirement benefits  changes in benefit obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as costs in the statement of operations  but are recognized in future years over the expected average future service of the active employees or the average remaining life expectancies of inactive employees 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
as of march   we have generated approximately million in us net operating loss carryforwards that we cannot use to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
we recognize a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the deferred tax asset 
we have established a valuation allowance for us and certain foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty that we will generate enough income in those taxing jurisdictions to utilize the assets 
in addition  future utilization of nol carryforwards is subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
this section generally relates to a percent change in ownership of a company over a three year period 
we believe that the issuance of our common stock in the december follow on public offering resulted in an ownership change under section accordingly  our ability to use nol tax attributes generated prior to december is limited to approximately  per year 
additionally  we believe there was an ownership change in december accordingly  our ability to use nol tax attributes generated after december and before december is limited to approximately  per year

non gaap financial measures the following table reconciles our operating loss calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap to non gaap financial measures that exclude non cash charges for share based compensation  and depreciation and amortization expenses from gross profit  operating expenses and operating loss 
the non gaap financial measures used by management and disclosed by us are not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures and consolidated financial results calculated in accordance with gaap  and you should carefully evaluate our reconciliations to non gaap 
we may calculate our non gaap financial measures differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to those used by other companies 
we have described the reconciliations of each of our non gaap financial measures described above to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

table of contents we use these non gaap financial measures  and in particular non gaap operating loss  for internal managerial purposes and incentive compensation for senior management because we believe such measures are one important indicator of the strength and the operating performance of our business 
analysts and investors frequently ask us for this information 
we believe that they use these measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry  including as a means of comparing period to period results and as a means of evaluating our results with those of other companies 
our non gaap operating loss for fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the fiscal and decrease in non gaap operating loss compared to the same prior year period is attributed primarily to an increase in net sales which more than offset the increase in non gaap spending

we have continued to show an operating loss because we have continued to invest  primarily in selling and marketing  to grow our us business 
we generated approximately  of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal  as a result of a slight decrease in receivables balances at year end fiscal as compared to fiscal and a smaller accrual for bonus liabilities  offset by an increase in other current assets

sources of liquidity 
uroplasty bv  our subsidiary in the netherlands  has an ongoing agreement with rabobank of the netherlands for a  approximately  credit line secured by our facility in geleen  the netherlands 
the bank charges interest on the loan at the rate of one percentage point over the rabobank base interest rate base rate on march   subject to a minimum interest rate of per annum 
we had no borrowings outstanding on this credit line at march  and march  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs for beyond the next twelve months 
although we have historically not generated cash from operations because we have yet to achieve profitability  we anticipate that we will become profitable and generate excess cash from operations prior to the full use of the current available cash and investments 
to achieve this however  we must generate substantially more revenue than we have this year or in prior years 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend  in large part  on our ability to achieve widespread market acceptance for our products and successfully expand our business in the us  which in turn may be partially dependent upon re establishing broader reimbursement for our urgent pc product 
we cannot guarantee that we will be entirely successful at this 
if we fail to meet our projections of profitability and cash flow  or determine there is a need to use cash for matters we have not currently projected  we may need to again seek financing to meet our cash needs 
we cannot assure you that such financing  if needed  will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
commitments and contingencies 
we expect to continue to incur costs for clinical studies to support our ongoing marketing efforts and to meet regulatory requirements 
we also expect to continue to incur significant expenses to support our us sales and marketing organization  and for regulatory activities 
future payments under our contractual obligations as of march   consisting of royalties  purchase commitments  and operating leases  are summarized below payments due by period total less than year years years more than years minimum royalty payments a minimum purchase agreement b operating lease commitments c total contractual obligations 
table of contents a under a royalty agreement we pay royalties of five percent of net sales of macroplastique in countries where a patent is filed  subject to a monthly minimum of  the royalties payable under this agreement will continue until certain patents referenced in the agreement expire in under a license agreement for the macroplastique implantation system  we pay a royalty of great britain pounds for each unit sold during the life of the patent 
we recognized an aggregate of   and  of royalty expense  under these agreements in fiscal  and  respectively 
b in our normal course of business we have commitments  generally for periods of less than twelve months  to purchase from various vendors finished goods and manufacturing components under issued purchase orders 
c operating lease commitments include a long term lease with liberty property limited partnership for an  square foot facility for our us headquarters located at feltl road  minnetonka  minnesota 
the lease  effective may   has a term of months  requires average annual minimum rent payments of approximately  we have a defined benefit pension plan covering seven current and nineteen former employees in the netherlands 
we pay premiums to an insurance company to fund annuities for the current employees 
we are responsible for funding additional annuities based on continued service and future salary increases 
we closed this defined benefit plan for new employees in april as of that date  the netherlands subsidiary established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees 
we also have a defined benefit pension plan for six former employees of our uk subsidiary 
we closed this plan to further accrual for all employees effective december   and  effective march  established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees 
the following table presents the sensitivity of our funded status as of march   and expected fiscal pension expense to the following changes in key assumptions increase decrease funded status at march  increase decrease fiscal pension expense assumption increase in discount rate by percentage point decrease in discount rate by percentage point increase in estimated return on assets by percentage point n a decrease of estimated return on assets by percentage point n a increase in inflation rate by percentage point decrease in inflation rate by percentage point increase in compensation increase by percentage point decrease in compensation increase by percentage point regarding the dutch defined benefit plan  the market value of the assets is determined as the discounted stream of guaranteed benefit payments 
given the valuation method of the assets  the expected long term rate of return on assets equals the discount rate 
as such the dutch defined benefit plan is not included in the sensitivity analysis for the estimated return on assets  because the sensitivity on the estimated return on assets is implicitly already included in the sensitivity analysis for the discount rate 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk or availability 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of marketable securities  including money market funds  us government securities  and certain bank obligations 
our cash and cash equivalents as of march  include liquid money market accounts 
due to the relative short term nature of these investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business because of the global nature of our operations 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the euro and the british pound 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between our operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
a stronger dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states  while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect because our products are currently manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volumes within local economies and the impact of any pricing actions we may take as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies decreases 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar in relation to our foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately  on our fiscal sales 
this amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impacts on the related cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the applicable foreign currencies
