we historically have used a combination of borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand to pay the purchase price of our acquisitions 
the following table summarizes our acquisition activity for the year ended in thousands  except number of acquisitions closed december  number of acquisitions closed total cash consideration market opportunity we operate in the insurance  consumer finance and commercial finance industries principally in the united states  offering our services and products through the brands and distribution bases of our clients 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the following key industry trends financial performance of financial services companies and retailers 
financial services companies and retailers offer complementary services and products  including payment protection and insurance related services and products  which we believe increase their revenues  enhance customer value and loyalty and improve their profitability 
growth of outsourcing in the insurance industry 
by outsourcing business functions that can be more efficiently and cost effectively provided by specialized service providers  we believe that insurance companies can increase productivity  focus on core competencies and reduce operating costs 
growth of the specialty p c insurance market 
we believe the market for specialty p c insurance products has grown as a result of increased acceptance of these products by insured parties and the development of new risk management products by insurance carriers 
insurance carriers operating in the surplus lines market generally distribute their products through wholesale insurance brokers  such as bliss glennon 
our competitive strengths we believe the following to be the key strengths of our business model strong value proposition for our clients and their customers 
our solutions manage the essential aspects of insurance distribution and administration  providing low cost access to complex  often highly regulated markets  which we believe enables our clients to generate high margin  incremental revenues  enter new markets  mitigate risk  improve operating efficiencies and enhance customer loyalty 
proprietary technology and low cost operating platform 
our proprietary technology delivers low cost  highly automated services to our clients without significant up front investments and enables us to automate core business processes and reduce our clients operating costs 
scalability 
we believe that our scalable and flexible technology infrastructure  together with our highly trained and knowledgeable information technology personnel and consultants  enables us to add new clients and launch new services and products and expand our transaction volume quickly and easily without significant incremental expense 
high barriers to entry 
we believe that each of our businesses would be time consuming and expensive for new market participants to replicate due to the barriers to entry provided by our long term relationships with clients and other market participants and substantial experience in the markets that we serve 
experienced management team 
we have an experienced management team with extensive operating and industry experience in the markets that we serve 
our management team has successfully developed profitable new services and products and completed the acquisition of thirteen complementary businesses since january  while we believe these strengths will enable us to compete effectively  there are various risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our competitive position 
see item a 
risk factors  for a discussion on these factors 
key attributes of our business model we believe the following are the key attributes of our business model recurring revenue generation 
our business model  which includes the deployment of our technology with many of our clients  has historically generated substantial recurring revenues  high profit margins and significant operating cash flows 
long term relationships 
by delivering value added services and products to our clients customers  and offering fixed term contracts  we become an important part of our clients businesses and develop long term relationships 
wholesale distribution 
we provide most of our services and products to businesses on a wholesale basis enabling our clients to enhance their customer relationships and allowing us to take advantage of economies of scale 
business diversification 
our businesses and results of operations are highly diversified within the financial services industry and among retailers  which positions us to take better advantage of emerging industry trends and to better manage business and insurance cycles than companies that operate in only one sector of the financial services industry 
our growth strategy we believe the following are the key contributors to our growth strategy provide high value solutions 
we continue to enhance our technologies and processes and focus on integrating our operations with those of our clients in order to provide our clients with services and products that will allow them to generate incremental revenues while reducing the costs of providing insurance and other financial products 
increase revenue from our existing clients 
we will seek to leverage our long standing relationships with our existing clients by providing them with additional services and products  introducing new services and products for them to market to their customers and establishing volume based fee arrangements 
expand client base in existing markets 
we intend to take advantage of business opportunities to develop new client relationships through our direct sales force  from referrals from existing clients and business partners  by responding to requests for proposals and through our participation in industry events 
enter new geographic markets 
we will look to expand our market presence in new geographic markets in the united states and internationally by broadening the jurisdictions in which we operate  hiring new employees  opening new offices  seeking additional licenses and regulatory approvals and pursuing acquisition opportunities 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
we plan to continue pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses to expand our service offerings  access new markets and expand our client base 
competition our businesses focus on niche segments within broader insurance markets 
while we face competition in each of our businesses  we believe that no single competitor competes against us in all of our segments and the markets in which we operate are generally characterized by a limited number of competitors 
competition in our operating segments is based on many factors  including price  industry knowledge  quality of client service  the effectiveness of our sales force  technology platforms and processes  the security and integrity of our information systems  the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries  office locations  breadth of products and services and brand recognition and reputation 
some competitors may offer a broader array of services and products  may have a greater diversity of distribution resources  may have a better brand recognition  may have lower cost structures or  with respect to insurers  may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings 
some competitors also have larger client bases than we do 
in addition  new competitors could enter our markets in the future 
the relative importance of these factors varies by product and market 
the competitive landscape for each of our business segments is described below 
in our payment protection business  we compete with insurance companies  financial institutions and other insurance service providers 
the principal competitors for our payment protection business include the payment protection groups of the warranty group  assurant  inc  asurion corporation and smaller regional companies 
as a result of state and federal regulatory developments and changes in prior years  certain financial institutions are able to offer debt cancellation plans and are also able to affiliate with other insurance companies in order to offer services similar to those in our payment protection business 
as financial institutions gain experience with payment protection programs  their reliance on our services and products may diminish 
protectcell principally serves independent wireless retailers 
competitors offering similar products and services to protectcell include esecuritel holdings  llc  asurion  llc and global warranty group  llc 
our bpo business competes with a variety of companies  including large multinational firms that provide consulting  technology and or business process services  off shore business process service providers in low cost locations like india  and in house captive insurance companies of potential clients 
our principal business process outsourcing competitors include aon corporation  computer sciences corporation  direct response insurance administrative services  inc  marsh mclennan companies  inc  dell services and unisys corporation 
the trend toward outsourcing and technological changes may also result in new and different competitors entering our markets 
there could also be newer competitors with strong competitive positions as a result of strategic consolidation of smaller competitors or of companies that each provide different services or serve different industries 
in addition  a client or potential client may choose not to outsource its business  including by setting up captive outsourcing operations or by performing formerly outsourced services themselves 
our brokerage business competes with numerous firms for retail insurance clients  including amwins group  inc  arthur j 
gallagher co  brown brown  inc and the swett crawford group  inc 
many of our brokerage competitors have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us 
because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature  this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of california 
this could also impact our ability to compete effectively in any new states or regions that we enter 
a number of standard market insurance companies are engaged in the sale of products that compete with those products we offer 
these carriers sell their products directly through retail agents and brokers  without the involvement of a wholesale broker  which may yield higher commissions to retail agents and brokers and may impact our ability to compete 
in addition  the internet continues to evolve as a source for direct placement of personal lines insurance business 
although we are uniquely positioned in the facultative reinsurance marketplace with no comparable companies currently providing similar services  systems such as aon faconnect  the lexisnexis insurance exchange and the lloyd exchange have technology platforms that could provide solutions which could directly compete with us in the future 
in addition  the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate 
as a result  the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation  which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions  including competition for acquisition prospects 
regulation we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act  and its rules and regulations  which requires us to file reports  proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec 
our payment protection  bpo and brokerage businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision  including at the federal  state  local and foreign level 
we cannot predict the impact of future changes to such laws or regulations on our business 
future laws and regulations  or the interpretation thereof  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
regulation payment protection segment state regulation our insurance operations and subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which they transact business 
state insurance laws and regulations regulate most aspects of our insurance businesses  and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed 
our non us insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled ie  turks and caicos 
our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by us federal  state and local tax laws  and the tax laws of non us jurisdictions 
the extent of us state insurance regulation varies  but generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state 
the purpose of the laws and regulation affecting our insurance operations is primarily to protect the policyholders and not our stockholders or our agents ie  the financial institutions that sell our products to their customers 
the regulation  supervision and administration by state departments of insurance relate  among other things  to standards of solvency that must be met and maintained  the payment of dividends  changes in control of insurance companies  the licensing of insurers and their agents and other producers  the types of insurance that may be written  privacy practices  the ability to enter and exit certain insurance markets  the nature of and limitations on investments and premium rates  or restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy  reserves and provisions for unearned premiums  losses and other obligations  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  payment of sales compensation to third parties  approval of policy forms  and the regulation of market conduct  including underwriting and claims practices 
insurance holding company statutes 
as a holding company  we are not regulated as an insurance company  but because we own capital stock in insurance subsidiaries  we are subject to the state insurance holding company statutes  as well as certain other laws of each of the states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries 
all holding company statutes  as well as other laws  require disclosure and in many instances  prior regulatory approval of material transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate 
the holding company statutes  as well as other laws  also require  among other things  prior regulatory approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer  certain transactions between affiliates and payments of extraordinary dividends or distributions 
transactions within the holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and reasonable  and each insurer policyholder surplus following any such transaction must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs 
dividends limitations 
we are a holding company and have limited direct operations 
our holding company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
accordingly  our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries  including statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries  as well as payments under our tax allocation agreement and management agreements with our subsidiaries 
the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled and in which our subsidiaries operate  which vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company 
along with solvency regulations  the primary factor in determining the amount of capital available for potential dividends is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from am best for our insurance company subsidiaries 
given recent economic events that have affected the insurance industry  both regulators and rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria  including increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries which  in turn  could negatively affect our capital resources 
the following table sets forth the dividends paid to us by our insurance company subsidiaries for the following periods for the years ended december  in thousands ordinary dividends extraordinary dividends total dividends regulation of investments 
our insurance company subsidiaries must comply with their respective state of domicile laws regulating insurance company investments 
these laws prescribe the kind  quality and concentration of investments and while unique to each state  the laws are modeled on the standards promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
such investment laws are generally permissive with respect to federal  state and municipal obligations  and more restrictive with respect to corporate obligations  particularly non investment grade obligations  foreign investment  equity securities and real estate investments 
each insurance company is therefore limited by the investment laws of its state of domicile from making excessive investments in any given security such as single issuer limitations or in certain classes or riskier investments such as aggregate limitation in non investment grade bonds 
the diversification requirements are broadly consistent with our investment strategies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non admitted assets for the purpose of measuring surplus  and  in some instances  would require divestiture of such non complying investments 
we believe the investments made by our insurance subsidiaries comply with these laws and regulations 
risk based capital requirements 
the naic has adopted a model act with risk based capital rbc formulas to be applied to insurance companies 
rbc is a method of measuring the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
rbc standards are used by state insurance regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating conditions 
the domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries have adopted laws substantially similar to the naic rbc model act 
rbc requirements determine minimum capital requirements and are intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations 
rbc levels are not intended as a measure to rank insurers generally  and the insurance laws in the domiciliary states of our subsidiaries generally restrict the public dissemination of insurers rbc levels 
under laws adopted by individual states  insurers having total adjusted capital less than that required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
federal regulation dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  which implements comprehensive changes to the regulatory landscape of financial services in the us many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rule making and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on our business  our customers or the insurance and financial services industries 
in addition  congress created the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb 
while the cfpb does not have direct jurisdiction over insurance products  it is possible that regulations promulgated by the cfpb may extend its authority to cover these products and thereby potentially affecting the company business or the clients that we serve 
gramm leach bliley act 
on november   the gramm leach bliley act of became law  implementing fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry in the united states 
the gramm leach bliley act permits the transformation of the already converging banking  insurance and securities industries by permitting mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms under one holding company 
under the gramm leach bliley act  community banks retain their existing ability to sell insurance products in some circumstances 
privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act became fully effective in these provisions established consumer protections regarding the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information and  as implemented through state insurance laws and regulations  require us to make full disclosure of our privacy policies to customers 
health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
through hipaa  the department of health and human services imposes obligations for issuers of health and dental insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors 
hipaa established requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information and new standards for electronic health care transactions 
the department of health and human services promulgated final hipaa regulations in the privacy regulations required compliance by april  the electronic transactions regulations by october and the security regulations by april recently  parts of hipaa were amended under the hitech act  and pursuant to these amendments  new regulations have been issued requiring notification of government agencies and consumers in the event of certain security breaches involving personal health information 
hipaa is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve 
consequently  our efforts to measure  monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with hipaa are ongoing 
failure to comply could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits 
knowing and intentional violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal penalties 
foreign jurisdictions 
a portion of our business is ceded to our reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in turks and caicos 
those subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements  such as filing annual financial statements  filing annual certificates of compliance and paying annual fees 
if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable laws  rules and regulations  the licenses issued by the regulatory authority in turks and caicos could be subject to modification or revocation  and our subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business 
regulation bpo segment we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations  particularly related to our administration of insurance products on behalf of other insurers 
in order for us to process and administer insurance products of other companies  we are required to maintain licenses of a third party administrator in the states where those insurance companies operate 
with regard to our third party administration operations  we also must comply with the related federal and state privacy laws that similarly apply to our insurance operations 
we are also subject to laws and regulations on direct marketing  such as the telemarketing consumer fraud and abuse prevention act and the telemarketing sales rule  the telephone consumer protection act  the do not call implementation act and rules promulgated by the federal communications commission and the federal trade commission and the can spam act 
failure to comply with the provisions of such acts and rules could result in fines and penalties 
as a business process outsourcer for insurers and financial institutions  we are subject to data protection and privacy laws  such as the gramm leach bliley act as well as hipaa and certain state data privacy laws 
in addition  the terms of our contracts typically require us to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
if we fail to comply with any applicable laws or regulations  we may be restricted in our ability to provide services and may also be subject to civil or criminal penalties  litigation as well as contract termination 
regulation brokerage segment our brokerage and premium finance operations are subject to regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
b g and our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents  brokers  producers and or agencies by state regulatory authorities in the states where we conduct business 
regulations and licensing laws vary by state and are often complex and subject to interpretation and enforcement by the relevant departments of insurance 
laws and regulations vary from state to state and are always subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities 
these authorities have substantial discretion as to the decision to grant  renew and revoke licenses and approvals 
our continuing ability to do business in the states in which we currently operate depends on the validity of and continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which we operate 
more restrictive laws  rules or regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult and expensive or adversely affect our business 
for further information  see item a 
risk factors of this annual report under risks related to regulatory and legal matters we are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations  which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 
seasonality our financial results may be affected by seasonal variations 
revenues in our payment protection business may fluctuate seasonally based on consumer spending trends  where consumer spending has historically been higher in september and december  corresponding to back to school and the holiday season 
accordingly  our payment protection revenues may reflect higher third and fourth quarters than in the first half of the year 
revenues in our brokerage business may fluctuate seasonally based on policy renewal dates  which are typically concentrated in july and december  the months during our third and fourth quarters 
in addition  our quarterly revenues may be affected by new placements  cancellations or non renewals of large policies because commission revenues are earned on the effective date as opposed to ratably over the year 
our quarterly brokerage revenues may also be affected by the amount of profit commissions received from insurance carriers  since profit commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year 
employees at december   we employed approximately people  which includes the employees from the december  acquisitions of protectcell and warranty  on a full or part time basis 
none of our employees are represented by unions or trade organizations 
we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
intellectual property we own or license a number of trademarks  patents  trade names  copyrights  service marks  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that relate to our services and products 
although we believe that these intellectual property rights are  in the aggregate  of material importance to our businesses  we believe that none of our businesses are materially dependent upon any particular trademark  trade name  copyright  service mark  license or other intellectual property right

risk factors the following are certain risks that management believes are specific to our business 
this should not be viewed as an all inclusive list of risks or presenting the risk factors listed in any particular order 
you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec when evaluating our company 
should any of the events discussed in the risk factors below occur  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected 
additional risks unknown at this time  or risks we currently deem immaterial  may also impact our financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our business and industries general economic and financial market conditions may have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition of all of our business segments 
general economic and financial market conditions  including the availability and cost of credit  the loss of consumer confidence  reduction in consumer or business spending  inflation  unemployment  energy costs and geopolitical issues  have contributed to increased uncertainty and volatility as well as diminished expectations for the us economy and the financial markets 
these conditions could materially and adversely affect each of our businesses 
adverse economic and financial market conditions could result in a reduction in the demand for  and availability of  consumer credit  which could result in reduced demand by consumers for our payment protection products and our payment protection clients opting to no longer make such products available  higher than anticipated loss ratios on our payment protection products due to rising unemployment or disability claims  higher risk of increased fraudulent insurance claims  individuals terminating loans or canceling credit insurance policies  thereby reducing our revenues  a reduction in the demand for consumer warranty products  service contract offerings  and motor club memberships  individuals terminating warranty products  service contract or motor club memberships  thereby reducing our revenues  businesses reducing the amount of coverage under surplus lines and specialty admitted insurance policies or allowing such policies to lapse thereby reducing our premium or commission income in our brokerage business  a reduction in demand for new surplus lines and specialty insurance policies from retail insurance brokers and agents or retail insurance brokers and agents and insurance companies ceasing to offer our surplus lines and specialty insurance products and related services from our brokerage business  a contraction in the reinsurance market caused by reduced demand by major insurers  reduced supply by reinsurers or other factors or reduced reinsurance demand by our insurance customers due to market conditions  our clients being more likely to experience financial distress or declare bankruptcy or liquidation  which could have an adverse impact on demand for our services and products and the remittance of premiums from such customers  as well as the collection of receivables from such clients for items such as unearned premiums  commissions or bpo related accounts receivable  which could make the collection of receivables from our clients more difficult  increased pricing sensitivity or reduced demand for our services and products  increased costs associated with  or the inability to obtain  debt financing to fund acquisitions or the expansion of our businesses  and defaults in our fixed income investment portfolio or lower than anticipated rates of return as a result of low interest rate environments 
if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic or financial market conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to such changes  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face significant competition in each of our businesses 
competition in our businesses is based on many factors  including price  industry knowledge  quality of client service  the effectiveness of our sales force  technology platforms and processes  the security and integrity of our information systems  the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries  office locations  breadth of services and products and brand recognition and reputation 
some competitors may offer a broader array of services and products  may have a greater diversity of distribution resources  may have better brand recognition  may have lower cost structures or  with respect to insurers  may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings 
some competitors also have larger client bases than we do 
in addition  new competitors could enter our markets in the future  and existing competitors may gain strength by forging new business relationships 
the competitive landscape for each of our businesses is described below 
payment protection in our payment protection business  we compete with insurance companies  financial institutions  extended service plan providers  membership plan providers and other insurance and warranty service providers 
the principal competitors for our payment protection business include the warranty group  assurant  inc  asurion corporation  esecuritel holdings  llc  asurion  llc  global warranty group  llc and smaller regional companies 
as a result of state and federal regulatory developments and changes in prior years  certain financial institutions are able to offer debt cancellation plans and are also able to affiliate with other insurance companies in order to offer services similar to those in our payment protection business 
this has resulted in new competitors  some of whom have significant financial resources  entering some of our markets 
as financial institutions gain experience with payment protection and warranty programs  their reliance on our services and products may diminish 
bpo our bpo business competes with a variety of companies  including large multinational firms that provide consulting  technology and or business process services  off shore business process service providers in low cost locations like india  and in house captive insurance companies of potential clients 
our principal business process outsourcing competitors include aon corporation  computer sciences corporation  direct response insurance administrative services  inc  marsh mclennan companies  inc  dell services and unisys corporation 
the trend toward outsourcing and technological changes may also result in new and different competitors entering our markets 
there could also be newer competitors with strong competitive positions as a result of consolidation of smaller competitors or of companies that each provide different services or serve different industries 
brokerage our brokerage business competes for retail insurance clients with numerous firms  including amwins group  inc  arthur j 
gallagher co  brown brown  inc and the swett crawford group  inc many of our brokerage competitors have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us 
because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature  this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of california 
this could also impact our ability to compete effectively in any new states or regions that we enter 
a number of standard market insurance companies are engaged in the sale of products that compete with those products we offer 
these carriers sell their products directly through retail agents and brokers without the involvement of a wholesale broker  which may yield higher commissions to retail agents and brokers and may impact our ability to compete 
although we are uniquely positioned in the facultative reinsurance marketplace with no comparable companies currently providing similar services 
systems such as aon faconnect  the lexisnexis insurance exchange and the lloyd exchange have technology platforms that could provide solutions which could directly compete with us in the future 
we expect competition to intensify in each of our businesses 
increased competition may result in lower prices and volumes  higher personnel and sales and marketing costs  increased technology expenditures and lower profitability 
we may not be able to supply clients with services or products that they deem superior and at competitive prices and we may lose business to our competitors 
if we are unable to compete effectively in any of our business segments  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly  which makes our future results of operations difficult to predict 
if our results of operations fall below expectations  the price of our common stock could decline 
our annual and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  our expenses as a percentage of revenues may be significantly different than our historical rates 
as a result  comparing our results of operations on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period include demand for our services and products  the length of our sales cycle  the amount of sales to new clients the timing of implementations of our services and products with new clients  pricing and availability of surplus lines and other specialty insurance products coverages  seasonality  the timing of acquisitions  competitive factors  prevailing interest rates  pricing changes by us or our competitors  transaction volumes in our clients businesses  the introduction of new services and products by us and our competitors  changes in strategic partnerships  changes in regulatory and accounting standards  and our ability to control costs 
in addition  our payment protection revenues can vary depending on the level of consumer activity and the success of our clients in selling products 
in our brokerage business  our commission and fee income can vary due to the timing of policy renewals  as well as the timing and amount of the receipt of profit commission payments and fees and the net effect of new and lost business production 
we do not control the factors that cause these variations 
specifically  third party customers demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals  new business  lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations 
in addition  we rely on retail insurance brokers and agents and insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions 
because these payments are processed internally by these companies  we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular firm in one period until after the end of that period  which can adversely affect our ability to budget for such period 
our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to retain our existing clients  cannot sell additional services and products to our existing clients  do not introduce new or enhanced services and products or are not able to attract and retain new clients 
our revenue and revenue growth are dependent on our ability to retain clients  to sell those clients additional services and products  to introduce new services and products and to attract new clients in each of our businesses 
our ability to increase revenues will depend on a variety of factors  including the quality and perceived value of our product and service offerings by existing and new clients  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  the speed with which our brokerage business can respond to requests for price quotes from retail insurance agents and brokers  and the availability of competitive services and products from our carriers  the successful installation and implementation of our services and products for new and existing payment protection and bpo clients  availability of capital to complete investments in new or complementary products  services and technologies  the availability of adequate reinsurance for us and our clients  including the ability of our clients to form  capitalize and operate captive reinsurance companies  our ability to find suitable acquisition candidates  successfully complete such acquisitions and effectively integrate such acquisitions  our ability to integrate technology into our services and products to avoid obsolescence and provide scalability  the reliability  execution and accuracy of our services  particularly our bpo services  and client willingness to accept any price increases for our services and products 
in addition  we are subject to risks of losing clients due to consolidation in each of the markets we serve 
our inability to retain existing clients  sell additional services and products  or successfully develop and implement new and enhanced services and products and attract new clients and  accordingly  increase our revenues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new clients in each of our businesses as well as long implementation periods that require significant resource commitments  which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new client relationships 
the industries in which we compete generally consist of mature businesses and markets and the companies that participate in these industries have well established business operations  systems and relationships 
accordingly  each of our businesses typically faces a long selling cycle to secure a new client 
even if we are successful in obtaining a new client engagement  it is generally followed by a long implementation period in which the services are planned in detail and we demonstrate to the client that we can successfully integrate our processes and resources with their operations 
we also typically negotiate and enter into a contractual relationship with the new client during this period 
there is then a long implementation period in order to commence providing the services 
we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle 
we may not succeed in winning a new client business  in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses 
even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential client and begin to plan the services in detail  such potential client may choose a competitor or decide to retain the work in house prior to the time a final contract is signed 
if we enter into a contract with a client  we will typically receive no revenues until implementation actually begins 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenue is based upon the success of our clients marketing programs  which may not generate the transaction volume we anticipate 
our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations  thereby further lengthening the implementation cycle 
if we are not successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle  in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle or in maintaining or reducing the duration of unprofitable initial periods in our contracts  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the time and effort required to complete the implementation phases of new contracts makes it difficult to accurately predict the timing of revenues from new clients as well as our costs 
acquisitions are a significant part of our growth strategy and we may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates  completing such acquisitions or integrating the acquired businesses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or growth 
historically  acquisitions have played a significant role in our expansion into new businesses and in the growth of some of our businesses 
acquiring complementary businesses is a significant component of our growth strategy 
accordingly  we frequently evaluate possible acquisition transactions for our business 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisitions  and such transactions may not be financed and completed on acceptable terms 
we may incur significant expenses in evaluating such acquisitions 
furthermore  any future acquisitions may not be successful 
in addition  we may be competing with larger competitors with substantially greater resources for acquisition targets 
any deficiencies in the process of integrating companies we may acquire could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions entail a number of risks including  among other things failure to achieve anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flow  increased expenses  diversion of management time and attention  failure to retain the acquired business customers or personnel  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  ability to realize synergies and cost savings  difficulties in integrating systems and personnel  and inaccurate assessment of liabilities 
our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and growth 
future acquisitions may reduce our cash resources available to fund our operations and capital expenditures and could result in increased amortization expense related to any intangible assets acquired  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  which could increase our interest expense 
our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity may be materially and adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
we are subject to various actual and potential claims  lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with our conduct in each of our businesses  including the handling and adjudicating of claims and the placement of insurance 
because such placement of insurance and handling claims can involve substantial amounts of money  clients may assert errors and omissions claims against us alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question 
claimants may seek large damage awards  and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs 
such claims  lawsuits and other proceedings could  for example  include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub agents improperly failed to procure coverage  report claims on behalf of clients  provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis 
while we would expect most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our self insured deductibles to be covered by our professional indemnity insurance  our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected if  in the future  our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable  or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure 
our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be materially and adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
we may lose clients or business as a result of consolidation within the financial services industry 
there has been considerable consolidation in the financial services industry  driven primarily by the acquisition of small and mid size organizations by larger entities 
we expect this trend to continue 
as a result  we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues from retail insurance brokerage firms that are acquired by other firms 
similarly  we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues if one or more of our payment protection clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with other companies 
to date  our business has not been materially affected by consolidation 
however  we may be affected by industry consolidation that occurs in the future  particularly if any of our significant clients are acquired by organizations that already possess the operations  services and products that we provide 
our ability to implement and execute our strategic plans may not be successful and  accordingly  we may not be successful in achieving our strategic goals  which may materially and adversely affect our business 
we may not be successful in developing and implementing our strategic plans for our businesses or the operational plans that have been or need to be developed to implement these strategic plans 
if the development or implementation of such plans is not successful  we may not produce the revenue  margins  earnings or synergies that we need to be successful 
we may also face delays or difficulties in implementing service  product  process and system improvements  which could adversely affect the timing or effectiveness of margin improvement efforts in our businesses and our ability to successfully compete in the markets we serve 
the execution of our strategic and operating plans will  to some extent  also be dependent on external factors that we cannot control 
in addition  these strategic and operational plans need to continue to be assessed and reassessed to meet the challenges and needs of our businesses in order for us to remain competitive 
the failure to implement and execute our strategic and operating plans in a timely manner or at all  realize the cost savings or other benefits or improvements associated with such plans  have financial resources to fund the costs associated with such plans or incur costs in excess of anticipated amounts  or sufficiently assess and reassess these plans could have a material and adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we may not effectively manage our growth  which could materially harm our business 
the growth of our business has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management  personnel  systems and resources 
to manage our growth  we must continue to improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures  and we will need to continue to expand  train and manage our personnel 
we must also maintain close coordination among our technology  compliance  legal  risk management  accounting  finance  marketing and sales organizations 
we may not manage our growth effectively  and if we fail to do so  our business could be materially and adversely harmed 
if we continue to grow  we may be required to increase our investment in facilities  personnel and financial and management systems and controls 
continued growth  especially in connection with expansion into new business lines  may also require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations and that we recruit  integrate  train and manage a growing employee base 
the expansion of our existing businesses  our expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes that are more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required 
we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary 
further  unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth  our operating margins and profitability will be materially and adversely affected 
as a holding company  we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations 
we act as a holding company for our subsidiaries and do not have any significant operations of our own 
dividends from our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to meet our obligations and pay dividends  if any  on our common stock 
these obligations include our operating expenses and interest and principal payments on our current and any future borrowings 
the agreements governing our credit facilities restrict our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or otherwise transfer cash to us 
under our credit facility  our subsidiaries are permitted to make distributions to us if no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such distribution 
if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividends or otherwise is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations  or if a subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us  we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of additional debt  the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets 
the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by each of the regulated insurance company subsidiaries in our payment protection segment is regulated by insurance laws and regulations of the states in which they operate 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
ordinary dividends  for which no regulatory approval is generally required  are limited to amounts determined by a formula  which varies by state 
some states have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus 
states also regulate transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries  such as those relating to the shared services  and in some instances  require prior approval of such transactions within the holding company structure 
if insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us such as payments for employee or other services would be adverse to policyholders or creditors  the regulators may block or otherwise restrict such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval 
in addition  there could be future regulatory actions restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or share services 
our success is dependent upon the retention and acquisition of talented people and the skills and abilities of our management team and key personnel 
our business depends on the efforts  abilities and expertise of our senior executives  particularly our chairman  president and chief executive officer  richard s 
kahlbaugh 
mr 
kahlbaugh and our other senior executives are important to our success because they have been instrumental in setting our strategic direction  operating our business  identifying  recruiting and training key personnel  maintaining relationships with our clients  and identifying business opportunities 
the loss of one or more of these key individuals could impair our business and development until qualified replacements are found 
we may not be able to replace these individuals quickly or with persons of equal experience and capabilities 
although we have employment agreements with certain of these individuals  we cannot prevent them from terminating their employment with us 
in addition  our non compete agreements with such individuals may not be enforced by the courts 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers except for mr 
kahlbaugh 
if we are unable to attract and retain talented employees  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  but there is no assurance that such capital will be available on a timely basis  on acceptable terms or at all 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to grow our businesses or fund our strategy or acquisitions 
additional financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders if raised through additional equity offerings 
a significant portion of our funding is under our existing credit facility  which matures in june additionally  any securities issued to raise such funds may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  our ability to expand  develop or enhance our services and products  enter new markets  consummate acquisitions or respond to competitive pressures could be materially limited 
risks related to our payment protection business our payment protection business relies on independent financial institutions  lenders and retailers to distribute its services and products  and the loss of these distribution sources  or the failure of our distribution sources to sell our payment protection products could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we distribute our payment protection products through financial institutions  lenders and retailers 
although our contracts with these clients are typically exclusive  they can be canceled on relatively short notice 
in addition  the distributors typically do not have any minimum performance or sales requirements and our payment protection revenue is dependent on the level of business conducted by the distributor as well as the effectiveness of their sales efforts for our payment protection products  each of which is beyond our control 
the impairment of our distribution relationships  the loss of a significant number of our distribution relationships  the failure to establish new distribution relationships  the failure to offer increasingly competitive products  the increase in sales of competitors services and products by these distributors or the decline in their overall business activity or the effectiveness of their sales of our payment protection products could materially reduce our payment protection sales and revenues 
also  the growth of our payment protection business is dependent in part on our ability to identify  attract and retain new distribution relationships and successfully implement our information systems with those of our new distributors 
reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses  and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for a substantial portion of the risks underwritten by our payment protection business through captive reinsurance companies owned by our payment protection clients as well as third party reinsurance companies 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to renew or purchase 
our clients may face difficulties forming  capitalizing and operating captive reinsurance companies  which could impact their ability to reinsure future business that we typically cede to them 
states also could impose restrictions on these reinsurance arrangements  such as requiring the insurance company subsidiary to retain a minimum amount of underwriting risk  which could affect our profitability and results of operations 
reinsurance for certain types of catastrophes generally could become unavailable or prohibitively expensive for some of our businesses 
such changes could substantially increase our exposure to the risk of significant losses from natural or man made catastrophes and could hinder our ability to write future business 
although the reinsurer is liable to the respective insurance subsidiary to the extent of the ceded reinsurance  the insurance company remains liable to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
ceded reinsurance arrangements  therefore  do not eliminate our insurance company obligation to pay claims 
while the captive reinsurance companies owned by our clients are generally required to maintain trust accounts with sufficient assets to cover the reinsurance liabilities and we manage these trust accounts on behalf of these reinsurance companies  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
the inability to collect amounts due from reinsurers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal 
we may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and our clients may not be able to continue to operate their captive reinsurance companies 
as a result  even where highly desirable or necessary  we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain or structure new reinsurance facilities  either our net exposures would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures  we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
either of these potential developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the structure of some of our commissions  we are exposed to risks related to the creditworthiness of some of our agents 
we are subject to the credit risk of some of the agents with which we contract within our payment protection business 
we typically advance agents commissions as part of our product offerings 
these advances are a percentage of the premium charged 
if we over advance such commissions to agents  they may not be able to fulfill their payback obligations  and it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a downgrade in the ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries may materially and adversely affect relationships with clients and adversely affect our results of operations 
claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are each a factor in establishing the competitive position of our insurance company subsidiaries 
a ratings downgrade  or the potential for such a downgrade  could  among other things  materially and adversely affect relationships with clients  brokers and other distributors of our services and products  thereby negatively impacting our results of operations  and materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in our markets 
rating agencies can be expected to continue to monitor our financial strength and claims paying ability  and no assurances can be given that future ratings downgrades will not occur  whether due to changes in our performance  changes in rating agencies industry views or ratings methodologies  or a combination of such factors 
our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims  which may require us to establish additional reserves that may materially and adversely reduce our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims with respect to reported claims and incurred but not reported claims as of the end of each accounting period 
reserves  whether calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or statutory accounting principles  do not represent an exact calculation of exposure 
instead  they represent our best estimates  generally involving actuarial projections  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for a claim or group of claims  based on our assessment of facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation 
the adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity  frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
these variables are affected by external factors such as changes in the economic cycle  unemployment  changes in the social perception of the value of work  emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability  emerging health issues  new methods of treatment or accommodation  inflation  judicial trends  legislative changes  as well as changes in claims handling procedures 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
reserve estimates are refined as experience develops 
adjustments to reserves  both positive and negative  are reflected in the statement of income of the period in which such estimates are updated 
because the establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses  we can give no assurances that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves 
in general  future loss development could require reserves to be increased  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the fair value of our invested assets and cash and may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability 
investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability and significant interest rate fluctuations  or prolonged periods of low interest rates  could impair our profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
we have a significant portion of our investments in cash and highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  during prolonged periods of declining or low market interest rates  such as those we have been experiencing since  the interest we receive on such investments decreases and affects our profitability 
in addition  certain factors affecting our business  such as volatility of claims experience  could force us to liquidate securities prior to maturity  causing us to incur capital losses 
if we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is appropriately matched with our insurance liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such liabilities 
the fair value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
because all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the fair value of these securities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
we employ asset liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility and to increase the likelihood that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due 
our asset liability management strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility  and significant fluctuations in the level of interest rates may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio  primarily from our investments in corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses 
the fair value of our investments may be materially and adversely affected by increases in interest rates  downgrades in the corporate bonds included in the portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other than temporary impairments 
each of these events may cause us to reduce the fair value of our investment portfolio 
further  the fair value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of a given issuer 
our fixed maturity portfolio may include below investment grade securities rated bb or lower by nationally recognized securities rating organizations 
these investments generally provide higher expected returns  but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities 
a significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity investment portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our bpo business a significant portion of our bpo revenues are attributable to one client  and any loss of business from  or change in our relationship with this client could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have derived and are likely to continue to derive a significant portion of our bpo revenues from a limited number of clients  specifically  in our bpo business  services provided to national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh  pa nufic 
see the section quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration risk in this report  regarding our concentration risk 
the loss of business or a reduction in the fees or other change in relationship with any of our significant clients  particularly nufic  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  there is no guarantee that we would be able to generate new business in the event that we lose a significant client 
the profitability of our bpo business will suffer if we are not able to price our outsourcing services appropriately  maintain asset utilization levels and control our costs 
the profitability of our bpo business is largely a function of the efficiency with which we utilize our assets and the pricing that we are able to obtain for our services 
our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including hiring and assimilating new employees  forecasting demand for our services and our need to devote time and resources to training  professional development and other typically non chargeable activities 
the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors  including our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  competition  the introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors and general economic conditions 
our ability to accurately estimate  attain and sustain revenues over increasingly longer contract periods could negatively impact our margins and cash flows 
therefore  if we are unable to price appropriately or manage our asset utilization levels  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the profitability of our bpo business is also a function of our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency 
as we increase the number of our employees and grow our business  we may not be able to manage the significantly larger workforce that may result and our profitability may be adversely and materially affected 
we enter into fixed term contracts and per unit priced contracts with our bpo clients  and our failure to correctly price these contracts may negatively affect our profitability 
the pricing of our services is usually included in contracts entered into with our clients  many of which are for terms of between one and three years 
in certain cases  we have committed to pricing over this period with only limited sharing of risk regarding inflation 
if we fail to estimate accurately future wage inflation rates or our costs  or if we fail to accurately estimate the productivity benefits we can achieve under a contract  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
some of our bpo contracts contain provisions which  if triggered  could result in the payment of penalties or lower future revenues and could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of our bpo contracts contain service level and performance provisions  including standards relating to the quality of our services  that would provide our clients with the right to terminate their contract if we do not meet pre agreed service level requirements and in the case of our contract with nufic  require us to pay penalties 
our contract with nufic also provides that  during the term of the contract and for months thereafter  we may not develop or service products for nufic competitors that are substantially similar to those we administer on behalf of nufic 
failure to meet these requirements could result in the payment of significant penalties by us to our clients which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our brokerage business we may not be able to accurately forecast our brokerage commissions and fee revenues because our commissions and fees depend on premiums charged by insurance companies  which historically have varied and  as a result  have been difficult to predict 
our brokerage business derives revenue principally from commissions and fees paid by insurance companies 
commissions and fees are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products 
the amount of such commissions and fees are therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies 
we do not determine insurance premium rates 
premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market and in many cases are regulated by the states in which they operate 
we have generally encountered declining rates for p c insurance since late premium pricing within the commercial p c insurance market in which we operate historically has been cyclical based on the underwriting capacity of the insurance carriers operating in this market and has been impacted by general economic conditions 
in a period of decreasing insurance capacity  insurance carriers typically raise premium rates 
this type of market frequently is referred to as a hard market 
in a period of increasing insurance capacity  insurance carriers tend to reduce premium rates 
this type of market frequently is referred to as a soft market  which the commercial p c market has experienced since  with a slight firming of the market in because our commission rates usually are calculated as a percentage of the gross premium charged for the insurance products that we place  our revenues are affected by the pricing cycle of the market and the amount of risk that is insured 
general economic conditions may impact the amount of risk that is insured by companies by affecting the value of the insured properties  the size of company workforces and the willingness of companies to self insure certain risks to reduce insurance expenses 
the frequency and severity of natural disasters and other catastrophic events can affect the timing  duration and extent of industry cycles for many of the product lines we distribute 
it is very difficult to predict the severity  timing or duration of these cycles 
the cyclical nature of premium pricing in the commercial p c insurance market may make our results of operations volatile and unpredictable 
to the extent that an economic downturn and or soft market persists for an extended period of time  our brokerage commissions and fees  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
we may experience reductions in the commission revenues we receive from risk bearing insurance companies as these insurance companies seek to reduce their expenses by reducing commission rates payable to non affiliated brokers or agents such as us  which may significantly affect the profitability of our brokerage business 
as traditional risk bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenues to non affiliated brokers or agents such as us  those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers 
the reduction of these commission rates  along with general volatility and or declines in premiums  may significantly affect the profitability of our brokerage business 
because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes  we may not be able to accurately forecast our commission revenues  including whether they will significantly decline 
as a result  we may have to adjust our budgets to account for unexpected changes in revenues  and any decreases in premium rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the loss of the services of any of our highly qualified brokers could harm our business and operating results 
our future performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly qualified brokers  including brokers who work in the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 
competition for productive brokers is intense  and our inability to recruit or retain these brokers could harm our business and operating results 
while many of our senior brokers own an equity interest in us and many have entered into employment agreements with us  these brokers may not serve the term of their employment agreements or renew their employment agreements upon expiration 
moreover  any of the brokers who leave our firm may not comply with the provisions of their employment agreements that preclude them from competing with us or soliciting our customers and employees  or these provisions may not be enforceable under applicable law or sufficient to protect us from the loss of any business 
in addition  we do not have employment  non competition or non solicitation agreements with all of our brokers 
we may not be able to retain or replace the business generated by a broker who leaves our firm or replace that broker with an equally qualified broker who is acceptable to our clients 
because our brokerage business is highly concentrated in california  adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in that state could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a significant portion of our brokerage business is concentrated in california 
we believe the regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in california currently is no more restrictive than in other states 
the insurance business is a state regulated industry  and therefore  state legislatures may enact laws  and state insurance regulators may adopt regulations  that adversely affect the profitability of insurance industries in their states 
because our brokerage business is concentrated in a few states  we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states 
in addition  the occurrence of adverse economic conditions  natural or other disasters  or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if insurance carriers begin to transact business without relying on wholesale insurance brokers  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer 
our brokerage business acts as an intermediary between retail agents and insurance carriers that  in some cases  will not transact business directly with retail insurance brokers and agents 
if insurance carriers change the way they conduct business and begin to transact business with retail agents without including us or if retail agents are enabled to transact business directly with insurance carriers as a result of changes in the surplus lines and specialty insurance markets  technological advancements or other factors  our role in the distribution of surplus lines and specialty insurance products could be eliminated or substantially reduced  and our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer 
in addition  if insurers retain more risk or cede risks that have traditionally been placed facultatively to treaty reinsurance arrangements  then revenue and cash flow attributable to ereinsure could suffer 
our growth strategy may involve opening or acquiring new offices and expanding internationally and will involve hiring new brokers and underwriters for our brokerage business  which will require substantial investment by us and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to grow our brokerage business organically depends in part on our ability to open or acquire new offices  expand internationally and recruit new brokers and underwriters 
we may not be successful in any efforts to open new offices  expand internationally or hire new brokers or underwriters 
the costs of opening a new office  expanding internationally and hiring the necessary personnel to staff the office can be substantial  and we often are required to commit to multi year  non cancelable lease agreements 
it has been our experience that our new brokerage offices may not achieve profitability on a stand alone basis until they have been in operation for at least three years 
in addition  we often hire new brokers and underwriters with the expectation that they will not become profitable until months after they are hired 
the cost of investing in new offices  brokers and underwriters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
moreover  we may not be able to recover our investments or these offices  brokers and underwriters may not achieve profitability 
our financial results may be materially and adversely affected by the occurrence of catastrophes 
portions of our brokerage business involve the placement of insurance policies that cover losses from unpredictable events such as hurricanes  windstorms  hailstorms  earthquakes  fires  industrial explosions  freezes  riots  floods and other man made or natural disasters  including acts of terrorism 
the incidence and severity of these catastrophes in any given period are inherently unpredictable  and climate change could further exacerbate the severity and frequency of weather related events 
we are generally eligible to earn profit commissions  which are commissions we receive from carriers based upon the ultimate profitability of the business that we place with those carriers 
the occurrence and severity of catastrophes could impair the amount of profit commissions that we receive in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
capacity in the reinsurance market is adversely impacted by catastrophes  which can adversely impact our results of operations 
we are subject to risks related to our profit commission arrangements and other compensation arrangements 
we derive a portion of our brokerage revenues from profit commissions based on the profitability of the insurance business we place with a carrier 
due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by some carriers  we cannot predict the receipt of these profit commissions and the amount of such profit commissions may be less than we anticipated 
because profit commissions affect our revenues  any decrease in such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  other companies have been the subject of investigations regarding profit commission arrangements by various governmental authorities within the past several years 
some of these investigations have focused on whether retail insurance brokers have adequately disclosed to their customers the receipt of profit commissions that are paid by insurance carriers to brokers based on the volume of business placed by the broker with the insurance carrier and other factors 
we have not been subject to any investigations that are focused on our disclosure of profit commissions 
the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing profit commission arrangements  including laws limiting or prohibiting such arrangements  and adding new or different disclosure of such arrangements to insureds 
various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters 
while we cannot predict the outcome of future governmental actions regarding commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators  any unfavorable resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks related to regulatory and legal matters we are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations  which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 
our operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 
such regulation or compliance could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of compliance  limiting or restricting the products or services we sell  or the methods by which we sell our services and products  or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings 
in all jurisdictions  the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities 
generally  such authorities have broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals and to implement new regulations 
we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in any jurisdiction in which we operate 
we can give no assurances that our businesses can continue to be conducted in each jurisdiction as they have been in the past 
such regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders 
to that end  the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to matters  such as licensing and authorizing companies and agents to transact business  regulating capital and surplus and dividend requirements  regulating underwriting limitations  regulating the ability of companies to enter and exit markets  imposing statutory accounting requirements and annual statement disclosures  approving changes in control of insurance companies  regulating premium rates  including the ability to increase or maintain premium rates  regulating trade billing and claims practices  regulating certain transactions between affiliates  regulating reinsurance arrangements  including the balance sheet credit that may be taken by the ceding or direct insurer  mandating certain insurance benefits  regulating the content of disclosures to consumers  regulating the type  amounts and valuation of investments  mandating assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and the ability to recover such assessments in the future through premium increases  regulating market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents  including compensation arrangements  and regulating a variety of other financial and non financial components of an insurer business 
our non insurance operations and certain aspects of our insurance operations are subject to various other federal and state regulations  including state and federal consumer protection  privacy and other laws 
an insurer ability to write new business is partly a function of its statutory surplus 
maintaining appropriate levels of surplus as measured by statutory accounting principles is considered important by insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers claims paying abilities and financial strength 
failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny  a downgrade by rating agencies or enforcement action by regulatory authorities 
we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and  despite our best efforts  our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant regulators interpretations of such laws and regulations 
also  some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals or to limit or restrain operations in their jurisdiction 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from operating  limit some or all of our activities or financially penalize us 
these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of our reputation and customers  reduction in our profitability and subject us to fines  penalties and litigation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we retain confidential information in our information systems  and we are subject to a variety of privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations 
for example  some of our activities are subject to the privacy regulations of the gramm leach bliley act 
we also have contractual obligations to protect confidential information we obtain from our clients 
these obligations generally require us  in accordance with applicable laws  to protect such information to the same extent that we protect our own confidential information 
we have implemented physical  administrative and logical security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and systems and protecting our  our clients and their customers confidential information and personally identifiable information against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection  theft or loss of data 
despite such efforts  we may be subject to a breach of our security systems that results in unauthorized access to our facilities and or the information we are trying to protect 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our information systems could access  view  misappropriate  alter  or delete any information in the systems  including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information 
in addition  most states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer information 
any compromise of the security of our information systems that results in inappropriate disclosure of such information could result in  among other things  unfavorable publicity and damage to our reputation  governmental inquiry and oversight  difficulty in marketing our services  loss of clients  significant civil and criminal liability and the incurrence of significant technical  legal and other expenses  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
changes in regulation may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and limit our growth 
legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future 
if we were unable for any reason to comply with these requirements  it could result in substantial costs to us and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include  but are not limited to prohibiting retailers from providing debt cancellation policies or other ancillary products  prohibiting insurers from fronting captive reinsurance arrangements  placing or reducing interest rate caps on the consumer finance products our clients offer  limitations or imposed reductions on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies  increases in minimum capital  reserves and other financial viability requirements  impositions of increased fines  taxes or other penalties for improper licensing  the failure to promptly pay claims  however defined  or other regulatory violations  increased licensing requirements  restrictions on the ability to offer certain types of products  new or different disclosure requirements on certain types of products  and imposition of new or different requirements for coverage determinations 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies 
further  the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are re examining existing laws and regulations  specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations  interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations 
additionally  there have been attempts by the naic and several states to limit the use of discretionary clauses in policy forms 
the elimination of discretionary clauses could increase our costs under our payment protection products 
new interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new services and products and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously 
in addition  the naic proposed expansion of the market conduct annual statement could increase the likelihood of examinations of insurance companies operating in niche markets 
court decisions that impact the insurance industry could result in the release of previously protected confidential and privileged information by departments of insurance  which could increase the risk of litigation 
traditionally  the us federal government has not directly regulated the business of insurance 
however  federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies 
these areas include financial services regulation  securities regulation  privacy  tort reform legislation and taxation 
in view of recent events involving certain financial institutions and the financial markets  congress passed and the president signed into law the dodd frank act  which provides for the enhanced federal supervision of financial institutions  including insurance companies in certain circumstances  and financial activities that represent a systemic risk to financial stability or the us economy 
under the dodd frank act  the federal insurance office was established within the us treasury department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and its authority would likely extend to all lines of insurance that our insurance subsidiaries write 
the director of the federal insurance office will serve in an advisory capacity to the financial stability oversight council and have the ability to recommend that an insurance company or an insurance holding company be subject to heightened prudential standards by the federal reserve  if it is determined that financial distress at the company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the us economy 
the dodd frank act also provides for the preemption of state laws when inconsistent with certain international agreements and would streamline the regulation of reinsurance and surplus lines insurance 
at this time  we cannot assess whether any other proposed legislation or regulatory changes will be adopted  or what impact  if any  the dodd frank act or any other legislation or changes could have on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
with regard to payment protection products  there are federal and state laws and regulations that govern the disclosures related to lenders sales of those products 
our ability to administer those products on behalf of financial institutions is dependent upon their continued ability to sell those products 
to the extent that federal or state laws or regulations change to restrict or prohibit the sale of these products  our administration services and fees revenues would be adversely affected 
the dodd frank act created a new consumer financial protection bureau cfpb designed to add new regulatory oversight for these lender products 
recently  the cfpb enforcement actions have resulted in large refunds and civil penalties against financial institutions in connection with their marketing of payment protection and other products 
due to such regulatory actions  some lenders may reduce their sales and marketing of payment protection and other ancillary products  which may adversely affect our administration services and fees revenues 
the full impact of the cfpb oversight is unpredictable and has not yet been realized fully 
further  in a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn  regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations 
for example  insurance regulators may choose to restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies or reject rate increases due to the economic environment 
with respect to the p c insurance policies our payment protection business underwrites  federal legislative proposals regarding national catastrophe insurance  if adopted  could reduce the business need for some of the related products we provide 
additionally  as the us congress continues to respond to the recent housing foreclosure crisis  it could enact legislation placing additional barriers on creditor placed insurance 
in recent years  several large organizations became subjects of intense public scrutiny due to high profile data security breaches involving sensitive financial and health information 
these events focused national attention on identity theft and the duty of organizations to notify impacted consumers in the event of a data security breach 
existing legislation in most states requires customer notification in the event of a data security breach 
in addition  some states are adopting laws and regulations requiring minimum information security practices with respect to the collection and storage of personally identifiable consumer data  and several bills before congress contain provisions directed to national information security standards and breach notification requirements 
several significant legal  operational and reputational risks exist with regard to a data breach and customer notification 
a breach of data security requiring public notification can result in regulatory fines  penalties or sanctions  civil lawsuits  loss of reputation  loss of clients and reduction of our profitability 
our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions 
we may be materially and adversely affected by judgments  settlements  unanticipated costs or other effects of legal and administrative proceedings now pending or that may be instituted in the future  or from investigations by regulatory bodies or administrative agencies 
from time to time  we have had inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business 
such inquiries may result in various audits  reviews and investigations 
an adverse outcome of any investigation by  or other inquiries from  such bodies or agencies could have a material adverse effect on us and result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings  sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties  changes in personnel  and increased review and scrutiny of us by our clients  regulatory authorities  potential litigants  the media and others 
in particular  our insurance related operations are subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by insurance departments in jurisdictions in which we do business 
these insurance departments have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business and  in particular  monitor the manner in which an insurance company offers  sells and administers its products 
therefore  we may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations  including  but not limited to disputes over coverage or claims adjudication  disputes over claim payment amounts and compliance with individual state regulatory requirements  disputes regarding sales practices  disclosures  premium refunds  licensing  regulatory compliance  underwriting and compensation arrangements  disputes with taxation and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities  periodic examinations of compliance with applicable federal and state laws  and industry wide investigations regarding business practices including  but not limited to  the use of finite reinsurance and the marketing and refunding of insurance policies or certificates of insurance 
the prevalence and outcomes of any such actions cannot be predicted  and such actions or any litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if we were to experience difficulties with our relationship with a regulatory body in a given jurisdiction  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business in that jurisdiction 
in addition  plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against insurance and related companies 
current and future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure to these types of claims 
multi party or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic  non economic and or punitive damage awards 
the success of even one of these claims  if it resulted in a significant damage award or a detrimental judicial ruling could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
this risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of liability or recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our businesses 
we cannot predict at this time the effect that current litigation  investigations and regulatory activity will have on the industries in which we operate or our business 
in light of the regulatory and judicial environments in which we operate  we will likely become subject to further investigations and lawsuits from time to time in the future 
our involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur legal and other costs and  if we were found to have violated any laws  we could be required to pay fines and damages  perhaps in material amounts 
in addition  we could be materially and adversely affected by the negative publicity for the insurance and other financial services industries related to any such proceedings and by any new industry wide regulations or practices that may result from any such proceedings 
our cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institutions with which our cash and cash equivalents are deposited fail 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents with major third party financial institutions  including interest bearing money market accounts 
in the united states  these accounts were fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic regardless of account balance through the transaction account guarantee tag program created by dodd frank the expiration of the tag program on december   caused the fdic standard insurance limit of  per depositor per institution to be reimposed on january  thus  our accounts containing cash and cash equivalents may exceed the fdic standard  insurance limit from time to time 
risks related to our indebtedness our indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may materially and adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 
our debt service obligations vary annually based on the amount of our indebtedness and the associated fixed and floating interest rates 
see management discussion analysis liquidity and capital resources liquidity regarding the amount of outstanding debt and our annual debt service 
our total indebtedness was million at december  compared to million at december  although we believe that our current cash flow will be sufficient to cover our annual interest expense  any increase in our indebtedness or any decline in the amount of cash available increases the possibility that we could not pay  when due  the principal of  interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness 
in addition  our indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  including financial and other restrictive covenants  which could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness  make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business strategy or other purposes 
any of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
increases in interest rates could increase interest payable under our variable rate indebtedness 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our variable rate indebtedness 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk regarding our interest rate risk and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity regarding the amount of outstanding variable rate debt 
interest rate changes could increase the amount of our interest payments and thus negatively impact our future earnings and cash flows 
if we do not have sufficient earnings  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets  borrow more money or sell more securities  none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 
we may enter into hedging transactions that may become ineffective which adversely impact our financial condition 
part of our interest rate risk strategy involves entering into hedging transactions to mitigate the risk of variable interest rate instruments by converting the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate 
each hedging item must be regularly evaluated for hedge effectiveness 
if it is determined that a hedging transaction is ineffective  we may be required to record losses reflected in our results of operations which could adversely impact our financial condition 
despite our indebtedness levels  we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur more indebtedness  which could further exacerbate the risks related to our indebtedness described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness 
if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt  the risks that we and they now face as a result of our indebtedness could intensify 
restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
the agreements governing our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies or undertake actions that may be in our best interests 
the agreements governing our indebtedness include covenants restricting  among other things  our ability to incur or guarantee additional debt  incur liens  complete mergers  consolidations and dissolutions  sell certain of our assets that have been pledged as collateral  and undergo a change in control 
our assets have been pledged to secure some of our existing indebtedness 
our credit facility  entered into in august  with wells fargo bank is secured by substantially all of our property and assets and property and assets owned by lots intermediate co 
and certain of our subsidiaries that act as guarantors of our existing indebtedness 
such assets include the stock of lots intermediate co 
and the right  title and interest of the borrowers and each guarantor in their respective material real estate property  fixtures  accounts  equipment  investment property  inventory  instruments  general intangibles  intellectual property  money  cash or cash equivalents  software and other assets and  in each case  the proceeds thereof  subject to certain exceptions 
in the event of a default under our indebtedness  the lender could foreclose against the assets securing such obligations 
a foreclosure on these assets would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to our technology and intellectual property our information systems may fail or their security may be compromised  which could damage our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information systems and our ability to store  retrieve  process and manage significant databases and expand and upgrade our information systems 
we rely on these systems throughout our businesses for a variety of functions  including marketing and selling our payment protection products  providing our bpo services  providing ereinsure services to the reinsurance market  managing our operations  processing claims and applications  providing information to clients  performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records 
the interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through the loss of stored data  programming errors  the breakdown or malfunctioning of computer equipment or software systems  telecommunications failure or damage caused by weather or natural disasters or any other significant disruptions could harm our business  ability to generate revenues  client relationships  competitive position and reputation 
although we have additional data processing locations in jacksonville  florida and atlanta  georgia  disaster recovery procedures and insurance to protect against certain contingencies  such measures may not be effective or insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices  cover all such losses or be sufficient to compensate us for the loss of business that may result from any failure of our information systems 
in addition  our information systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions  computer viruses or other attacks which could disable our information systems and our security measures may not prevent such attacks 
the failure of our systems as a result of any security breaches  intrusions or attacks could cause significant interruptions to our operations  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the failure to effectively maintain and modernize our systems to keep up with technological advances could materially and adversely affect our business 
our businesses are dependent upon our ability to ensure that our information systems keep up with technological advances 
our ability to keep our systems integrated with those of our clients is critical to the success of our businesses 
if we do not effectively maintain our systems and update them to address technological advancements  our relationships and ability to do business with our clients may be materially and adversely affected 
our businesses depend significantly on effective information systems  and we have many different information systems for our various businesses 
we must commit significant resources to maintain and enhance existing information systems and develop new systems that allow us to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry  regulatory and legal standards and changing client preferences 
a failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems  or a failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems and eliminate redundant or obsolete applications  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or our ability to do business in particular jurisdictions 
if we do not effectively maintain adequate systems  we could experience adverse consequences  including the inability to effectively market and price our services and products and make underwriting and reserving decisions  the loss of existing clients  difficulty attracting new clients  regulatory problems  such as a failure to meet prompt payment obligations  internal control problems  exposure to litigation  security breaches resulting in loss of data  and increases in administrative expenses 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our ability not to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the success of our business will depend  in part  on preserving our trade secrets  maintaining the security of our know how and data and operating without infringing upon patents and proprietary rights held by third parties 
failure to protect  monitor and control the use of our intellectual property rights could cause us to lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures and copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our brands  technology and data 
these legal measures afford only limited protection  and competitors or others may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 
our trade secrets  data and know how could be subject to unauthorized use  misappropriation  or disclosure 
our trademarks could be challenged  forcing us to re brand our services or products  resulting in loss of brand recognition and requiring us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands or licensing 
if we are found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  we may be subject to injunctive relief restricting our use of affected elements of intellectual property used in the business  or we may be required to  among other things  pay royalties or enter into licensing agreements in order to obtain the rights to use necessary technologies  which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms  or redesign our systems  which may not be feasible 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
the intellectual property laws and other statutory and contractual arrangements we currently depend upon may not provide sufficient protection in the future to prevent the infringement  use or misappropriation of our trademarks  data  technology and other services and products 
policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive  and adequate remedies may not be available 
any future litigation  regardless of outcome  could result in substantial expense and diversion of resources with no assurance of success and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition

we are required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all sec reporting requirements on a timely basis 
we are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements  including the requirements of the nyse and certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of sox and the regulations promulgated thereunder  which impose significant compliance obligations upon us 
should we fail to comply with these rules and regulations we may face de listing from the nyse and face disciplinary actions from the sec which may adversely affect our stock price 
if our internal controls are found to be ineffective  our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 
our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december   we were not in compliance with section of sox 
our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of december  we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  which have required management resources to be diverted to efforts to remediate these material weaknesses 
during the course of year end accounting procedures for the fiscal year ended december   and as discussed in item a  controls and procedures  of this annual report on form k  we have identified control deficiencies relating to a the application of generally accepted accounting principles in a timely and accurate manner in the reporting of revenue  member benefit claims  and commissions of our motor clubs division  and b the support and verification of retrospective commission accrual estimates in our payment protection segment 

management has concluded that these control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of december  a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is one or more deficiencies in a process that create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely manner 
the deficiency in the application of our controls relating to the timely application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america u 
s 
gaap for revenue recognition of our motor clubs division on a gross basis rather than net resulted in a material misstatement of line item amounts in previously reported consolidated statements of income  which have been restated herein 
this material misstatement of our financial statements was not prevented or detected by us in the normal course of our financial statement close process 
the deficiencies relating to retrospective commissions did not result in errors in prior period financial statements but we have determined that controls were not adequate to prevent or detect a material misstatement 
while we believe that the remediation efforts we have recently instituted are adequate to correct the problems we have identified  we cannot be certain that these efforts will eliminate the material weaknesses we identified or ensure that we design  implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
there is also no assurance that we will not discover additional material weaknesses in our controls and procedures in the future 
our principal stockholder has substantial control over us 
affiliates of summit partners collectively and beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock at december  as a consequence  summit partners or its affiliates continue to be able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and any other significant transaction 
the interests of this stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders 
for instance  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price 
we expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly  which could cause a decline in the stock price  and holders of our common stock may not be able to resell shares at or above the cost of such shares 
securities markets worldwide have experienced  and are likely to continue to experience  significant price and volume fluctuations 
this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions  could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors  including market conditions in the broader stock market  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  investor perceptions of us and the industries in which we operate  sales  or anticipated sales  of large blocks of our stock  additions or departures of key personnel  regulatory or political developments  litigation and governmental investigations  and changing economic conditions 
these and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially  which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock 
in addition  in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business  which could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation 
if a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time  the market price of our common stock could decline 
at december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding  including shares held in treasury  with our directors  executive officers and affiliates holding a significant majority of these shares 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
the perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock 
a decline in the market price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business  publish research or reports containing negative information about our business  adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
moreover  if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock  or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations  our stock price could decline 
some provisions of delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us and diminish the value of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for  among other things restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and the business that can be conducted at such meeting  restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove a director or fill a vacancy on the board of directors  our ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the board of directors may determine  without stockholder approval  the absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors  a prohibition of action by written consent of stockholders unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations 
these provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company that is in the best interest of our non controlling stockholders 
even in the absence of a takeover attempt  the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts 
applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change in control of us 
state insurance regulatory laws contain provisions that require advance approval  by the state insurance commissioner  of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled  or  in some cases  having such substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled  in that state 
we own  directly or indirectly  all of the shares of stock of insurance companies domiciled in delaware  georgia  mississippi and louisiana  and of the shares of stock of an insurance company domiciled in kentucky 
because any purchaser of shares of our common stock representing or more of the voting power of the capital stock of fortegra generally will be presumed to have acquired control of these insurance company subsidiaries  the insurance change in control laws of california  delaware  georgia  louisiana and kentucky would apply to such a transaction 
in addition  the laws of many states contain provisions requiring pre notification to state agencies prior to any change in control of a non domestic insurance company subsidiary that transacts business in that state 
while these pre notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change in control  they do authorize issuance of cease and desist orders with respect to the non domestic insurer if it is determined that conditions  such as undue market concentration  would result from the change in control 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  for the foreseeable future  to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
we do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future to holders of our common stock 
as a result  capital appreciation in the price of our common stock  if any  will be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock
