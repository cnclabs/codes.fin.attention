overview zion oil is an initial stage oil and gas exploration company with a history of over years of oil and gas exploration in israel 
as of december   we have no revenues or operating income and are considered to be an exploration stage company 
we are headquartered in dallas  texas and have a field office in caesarea  israel 
we hold three petroleum exploration licenses  named the joseph license  the asher menashe license and the jordan valley license  covering approximately  acres of land onshore northern israel 
to date  we have completed drilling three exploratory wells in the joseph license and have completed drilling one exploratory well in the asher menashe license area 
while the presence of hydrocarbons were indicated during the drilling  none of the exploratory wells that we have drilled to date in our license areas have been deemed capable of producing oil or gas in commercial quantities 
as a result of the evaluation of previous and recently acquired geological and geophysical data relating to our license areas  we are in the process of re evaluating our exploration strategy going forward 
in evaluating our seismic and geologic database  we have identified areas of potential petroleum exploration interest that are outside our current license configurations 
in particular  we are in the process of applying to the petroleum commissioner for a new exploration license that is contiguous with and directly abuts our existing jordan valley license area and extends westward to the megiddo valley and includes the jezreel valley 
see exploration plans going forward 
there can be no assurance that the petroleum commissioner will grant our application 
if we are successful in our new license application to the petroleum commissioner  prior to any actual drilling in the new areas of interest  we will need to acquire additional seismic data so that we may better evaluate the area to determine if we would drill our next exploratory well there 
see risk factors 
following the acquisition and interpretation of the new seismic data that we plan to obtain in the new areas of interest assuming that we are in fact granted these exploration rights and the additional geological and geophysical studies for certain portions of the asher menashe license  we will be in a position to determine the site of our next exploratory well 
after we identify the site of our next exploratory well  we will need to begin the procedure of obtaining the needed authorizations and permits 
we anticipate that the newly promulgated regulations will considerably increase the time needed to obtain all of the needed permits and authorizations from regulatory and local bodies in israel 
see the discussion under the onshore petroleum exploration permitting process in israel above 
finally  prior to actually spudding our next exploratory well  we will need to contract with an appropriate rig contractor 
we anticipate that we will need to raise significant funds in order to complete any exploratory well that we spud 
to date  we have funded our operations through the issuance of our securities 
we anticipate that we will need to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities 
no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in raising the needed equity on terms favorable to use or at all 
principal components of our cost structure our operating and other expenses primarily consist of the following impairment of unproved oil and gas properties impairment expense is recognized if a determination is made that a well will not be able to be commercially productive 
the amounts include amounts paid in respect of the drilling operations as well as geological and geophysical costs and various amounts that were paid to israeli regulatory authorities 
general and administrative expenses overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of managing our exploratory operations  audit and other professional fees  and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense also includes non cash stock based compensation expense  investor relations related expenses  lease and insurance and related expenses 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to explore for natural gas and oil 
as a full cost company  we capitalize all costs associated with our exploration  and apportion these costs to each unit of production  if any  through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
as we have yet to have production  the costs of abandoned wells are written off immediately versus being included in this amortization pool 
critical accounting policies management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex of subjective decisions or assessment 
impairment of oil and gas properties we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized 
all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is included in income from continuing operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit of production method 
our oil and gas properties represent an investment in unproved properties 
these costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve base has not yet been established 
a further impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
abandonment of properties is accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs 
the net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value of future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at ten percent based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized for oil and gas properties is dependent upon the identification of economically recoverable reserves  together with obtaining the necessary financing to exploit such reserves and the achievement of profitable operations 
in july  following production and other testing conducted at the ma anit joseph well  we conducted an open hole drill stem test and the test results confirmed that the well does not contain hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in the zone tested 
following review and further analysis of the operations and geological reports prepared by our geoscientists in consultation with outside consultants relating to the drilling and testing of the ma anit joseph well  it was determined that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not present in the ma anit joseph well 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  in the quarter ended september  to our unproved oil and gas properties in respect of the two wells 
following the conclusion of the re entry operations into the elijah well and related geological and geophysical testing in the third fourth quarters of  we recorded in the quarter ended december  a non cash impairment charge of  to our unproved oil and gas properties  comprised of  in respect of the elijah re entry well operations and  in respect of the withdrawal of the three applications for petroleum exploration rights originally submitted in in june  following the analysis of the results of the testing of our ma anit well workover and an evaluation of the mechanical condition of the well  we determined that the well was incapable of producing oil and or gas in commercial quantities 
in order to optimize drilling operations on the company s planned ma anit rehoboth well  we ceased operations on the ma anit well and  as required by the petroleum law  formally relinquished the ma anit joseph license 
as planned  we used the ma anit wellbore  down to approximately  feet  meters  as the upper part of the wellbore for the ma anit rehoboth well 
this well was directionally drilled from that point to penetrate the middle and the lower triassic 
the company drilled this well to a depth of  feet  meters 
in april  following production and other testing  management concluded that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons were not present in the ma anit rehoboth well 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of  in the quarter ended june  to its unproved oil and gas properties in respect of the ma anit rehoboth well 
following the impairment charges noted above  the total net book value of our unproved oil and gas properties under the full cost method is  at december  currency utilized although our oil gas properties and our principal operations are in israel  we report all our transactions in united states dollars 
certain dollar amounts in the financial statements may represent the dollar equivalent of other currencies 
valuation of deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that we believe is likely to be realized in the future 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance we have considered not only future taxable income but also feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
in the event that we were to determine that it would be likely that we would  in the future  realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made 
in the period that such a determination was made  the adjustment to the deferred tax asset would produce an increase in our net income 
asset retirement obligation we record a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statements of operations data for the years ended december st 
all data is in thousands of usd general and administrative expenses legal and professional   salaries    other    impairment of unproved oil and gas properties   other income expense  net net loss    for the year ended december  compared to december  revenue 
we currently have no revenue generating operations as we are still a development stage company 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to the impairment charge of  recorded during the three months ended september  in respect of both the ma anit joseph well and the elijah well  offset by an impairment charge of  recorded during the three months ended december  in respect of the elijah well re entry 
salary expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the slight increase in salary expenses during as compared to is primarily attributable to  in non cash expenses related to the grant of incentive options and the payout of amounts to departing senior management personnel 
legal and professional fees for were  compared to  for the slight decrease in legal and professional fees is primarily attributable to the decreased utilization of legal services resulting from the decrease in operational activity in other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the decrease in other general and administrative expenses in as compared to  which is comprised of non compensation  non professional expenses incurred  is primarily attributable to a significant decrease in drilling and operational related expenses that we recorded during  compared to the amount recorded in  and decreased investor relations related expenses for  compared to other income expense  net 
other income expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in other income loss  net is primarily attributable to currency exchange gains generated by exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar to the new israeli shekel during net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  compared to december  revenue 
we currently have no revenue generating operations as we are still a development stage company 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to the impairment charge of  recorded during the three months ended september  in respect of both the ma anit joseph well and the elijah well 
salary expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in salary expenses during is mainly attributable to  in non cash expenses related to the grant of incentive options 
the remainder of the increase in salary expenses is attributable to the expansion of staff to support operations 
legal and professional fees for were  compared to  for the increase in legal and professional fees is primarily attributable to the increased utilization of legal services resulting from the increase in operational activity in the first half of other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the  increase in other general and administrative expenses  which is comprised of non compensation  non professional and non operational expenses incurred in our offices  is primarily attributable to drilling and production related expenses that we recorded in the fourth quarter of in the amount of  following the recording of the impairment charge during the quarter ended september  and investor relations related expenses in the amount of  other income expense  net 
other income expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in other income loss  net is primarily attributable to currency exchange losses generated by exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar to the new israeli shekel during net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to meet potential cash requirements 
as discussed above  we have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into common stock as well as proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common equity 
at december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents compared to  at december  our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was  at december  and  at december  during the year ended december   we did not record any expenses in relation to rights offerings as compared to  recorded during the year ended december  in respect of the rights offering completed in july net cash provided by financing activities was  net cash used for investment in our unproved oil and gas properties was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   these amounts were primarily drilling related expenditures 
we expect to incur additional significant expenditures to further our exploration programs 
we estimate that  when we are not actively drilling a well  our monthly non operational expenditure is approximately  per month 
however  when we are engaged in active drilling operations  we estimate that there is an additional cost of approximately  per month 
the above estimates are subject to change 
management believes that our existing cash balance will be sufficient to satisfy our current obligations and maintain our operations through january  however  there are factors that can adversely impact our ability to fund our operating needs through such date  including without limitation  unexpected or unforeseen cost overruns in planned non drilling exploratory work ie  seismic acquisitions in existing and newly sought license areas and the costs associated with extended delays in undertaking the required exploratory work  which is typical of what we have experienced in the past  or plugging and abandoning activities 
we are considering various alternatives with respect to raising additional capital but to date have no commitments for such financing 
we expect that when we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities  debt or other financing arrangements 
because of the absence of any oil and natural gas reserves  there can be no assurance this capital will be available and if it is not  we may be forced to substantially curtail or cease exploration  appraisal and development expenditures 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations for continuing operations at december  and the effect such obligations is expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payment due by period in thousands of usd thereafter total exploration related commitments  operating leases employment agreements total   off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently use any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position  or for any other purpose 
recently issued accounting pronouncements during  there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements which were issued and which have relevancy to our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and or equity prices 
in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risks 
a portion of our expenses  primarily labor expenses and certain supplier contracts  are nominated in new israeli shekels nis 
as a result  we have significant exposure to the risk of fluctuating exchange rates with the us dollar  our primary reporting currency 
the recent weakness of the us dollar in the international markets has been equally reflected against nis and this may continue in the future 
since december    and to february   the us dollar has devalued by approximately  and respectively against the nis 
continuing devaluation of the us dollar against the nis will result in higher operating costs from nis denominated expenses 
we do not currently hedge against currency exchange rate risks 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments 
we maintain an investment portfolio of short term bank deposits and money market funds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term bank deposits of approximately  the weighted average annual interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was approximately 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in short term bank deposits and money market funds that may invest in high quality debt instruments
