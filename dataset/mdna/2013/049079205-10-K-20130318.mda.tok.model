in the united states  we offer wireless voice and data services to retail customers under the alltel name in rural markets located principally in the southeast and midwest 
additionally  we offer wholesale wireless voice and data roaming services to national  regional  local and selected international wireless carriers in rural markets located principally in the southwest and midwest united states 
we also offer wireless voice and data services to retail customers in guyana  the caribbean and smaller markets in the united states 
wireline 
our local telephone and data services include our operations in guyana and the mainland united states 
we are the exclusive licensed provider of domestic wireline local and long distance telephone services in guyana and international voice and data communications into and out of guyana 
we also offer facilities based integrated voice and data communications services to enterprise and residential customers in new england  primarily in vermont  and wholesale transport services in vermont and new york state

management fees from consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation 
we are dependent on our us wireless segment for the substantial majority of our revenue and profits 
for the year ended december   approximately of our consolidated revenue was generated by our us wireless segment 
our us retail wireless revenue is primarily driven by the number of subscribers to our services  their adoption of our enhanced service offerings and their related voice and data usage 
the number of subscribers and their usage volumes and patterns also has a major impact on the profitability of our us retail wireless operations 
as of december   our us retail wireless services were provided to approximately  customers under the alltel brand name 
our wireless licenses provide mobile data and voice coverage to a network footprint covering a population of approximately four and a half million people as of december  through the acquisition of a portion of the former alltel network from verizon wireless the alltel acquisition  we acquired a regional  non contiguous wireless network that requires continued network expansion and improvements as well as roaming support to ensure ongoing nationwide coverage 
in late july  we completed the transition of our alltel customers from the legacy alltel information technology systems  platforms and customer care 
table of contents centers to our own the alltel transition and  as a result  eliminated many of the duplicate costs associated with the migration in the second half of and into our retail wireless business competes with national  regional and local wireless providers offering both prepaid and postpaid services such as our primary competitor  verizon wireless 
we provide wholesale roaming services in a number of areas in the us  including in areas in which we also have retail wireless operations 
our wholesale wireless revenue is an important part of our overall us wireless segment revenue because this revenue has a higher margin of profitability than our retail revenue 
wholesale wireless revenue is primarily driven by the number of sites and base stations we operate  the amount of voice and data traffic from the subscribers of other carriers that each of these sites generates  and the rate we get paid from other carrier customers for serving that traffic 
the most significant competitive factor we face in our us wholesale wireless business is the extent to which our carrier customers choose to roam on our networks or elect to build or acquire their own infrastructure in a market  reducing or eliminating their need for our services in those markets 
pending sale of us retail wireless business in the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of a portion of the former alltel network from verizon wireless through our us retail wireless business  which now provides wireless voice and data services in rural markets of the united states under the alltel brand name the alltel acquisition and  in the third quarter of  completed the migration of the alltel assets to our own information technology systems  telecommunications networks and platforms the alltel transition 
on january   we entered into a purchase agreement with at t mobility llc at t to sell certain of the assets used in our alltel business the alltel sale 
under the terms of the agreement  at t will purchase the operations in an all cash transaction valued at approximately million 
for the year ended december   our alltel business constituted approximately million  or  of our consolidated revenues and million  or of our consolidated operating income 
although the consummation of the alltel sale is subject to customary closing conditions  including approval of the federal communications commission  the required waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of has expired and we currently expect to complete the transaction in the second half of for the purpose of clarity and consistency  each of the forward looking statements made regarding our operations in this item assumes that the alltel sale has not yet been consummated 
merger with m wireless  ltd 
on may   we completed the merger of our bermuda wireless operations  bermuda digital communications  ltd 
bdc  with that of m wireless  ltd 
m  a wireless provider in bermuda the bermuda merger 
as part of the bermuda merger  m merged with and into bdc  and the combined entity continues to operate under bdc cellone brand 
as a result of the bermuda merger  our ownership interest in bdc was reduced to a controlling interest in the combined entity 
since we have the right to designate the majority of seats on the combined entity board of directors and therefore control its management and policies  we have consolidated the results of the combined entity in our consolidated financial statements effective on the date of the bermuda merger 
stimulus grants we were awarded several federal stimulus grants in and by the us government under provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of intended to stimulate the deployment of broadband infrastructure and services to rural  unserved and underserved areas 
as of december   we have spent i million in capital expenditures of which million has 
table of contents been or will be funded by the federal stimulus grant in connection with our ion upstate new york rural broadband initiative  which involves building ten new segments of fiber optic  middle mile broadband infrastructure in upstate new york and parts of pennsylvania and vermont  ii million in capital expenditures of which million has been or will be funded by the federal stimulus grant in connection with our last mile broadband infrastructure buildout in the navajo nation across arizona  new mexico and utah  and iii million in capital expenditures of which million has been or will be funded by the federal stimulus grant in connection with our fiber optic middle mile network buildout to provide broadband and transport services to over community anchor institutions in vermont 
the results of our new york and vermont stimulus projects are included in our us wireline segment and the results of our navajo stimulus project are included in our us wireless segment 
mobility fund grants in november  the federal communications commission fcc released an order reforming its universal service fund usf program  which previously provided support to carriers seeking to offer telecommunications services in high cost areas and to low income households 
in  we received approximately million in usf support to our us wireless businesses relating to high cost areas 
beginning in june  the fcc began phasing out this existing usf support at a rate of per year over the next five years as part of its reform program 
also as part of the usf reform program  the fcc created two new funds  including the mobility fund  a one time grant meant to support wireless coverage in underserved geographic areas in the united states 
on october   we were provisionally awarded approximately million by the fcc under the new mobility fund the mobility fund grants 
although receipt of the mobility fund i support is still subject to additional filing requirements  including letters of credit and final fcc approval  our alltel business expects to receive approximately million and our wholesale wireless business expects to receive approximately million in support beginning in to expand voice and broadband networks in certain geographic areas in order to offer either g or g coverage 
as part of the receipt of these funds  we committed to comply with certain additional fcc construction and other requirements 
the results of our mobility fund projects  once initiated  will be included in our us wireless segment 
any actual award of mobility fund grants is subject to certain conditions  including the issuance of a letter of credit under our amended credit facility 
if we fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions upon which the mobility fund grants were granted  or if we lose eligibility for mobility fund support  the fcc will be entitled to draw the entire amount of the letter of credit applicable to the affected project and may disqualify us from the receipt of additional mobility fund support

stockholders us wireless revenue 
us wireless revenue includes voice and data services revenue from our prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as our wholesale roaming operations 
retail revenue is derived from subscriber fees for use of our networks and facilities  including airtime  roaming and long distance as well as enhanced services such as caller identification  call waiting  voicemail and other features 
retail revenue also includes amounts received from the universal service fund usf 
wholesale revenue is generated from providing mobile voice or data services to the customers of other wireless carriers and also includes revenue from other related wholesale services such as the provision of network switching services and certain wholesale transport services using our wireless subsidiaries networks 

table of contents retail revenue the retail portion of our us wireless revenue was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in retail us wireless revenues was primarily the result of a decline in postpaid subscribers  which typically generate higher average revenues than prepaid customers  that we experienced during the past year due to post alltel acquisition challenges we have faced 
we believe that this decline is due in part to the effects of the separation of our markets from the formerly unified alltel market  leaving many of our subscribers near the edge or outside of our licensed territory 
in late july  we completed our alltel transition  which enabled us to enhance our service offerings and further control churn 
these subscriber related functions had been somewhat constrained during the transition period and contributed to a continued decline in our us retail wireless revenue 
as of december   we had approximately  us retail wireless subscribers including  postpaid subscribers and  prepaid subscribers  an increase of  subscribers from the approximately  subscribers we had as of december  and a  subscriber increase from the approximately  subscribers we had as of september  despite our net increase in total subscribers  postpaid subscribers have declined in the past year from  at december  we will continue to focus on improving gross additions to our subscriber base in future periods as we concentrate our efforts on increasing distribution  by means such as the re launch of our u prepaid branded offering in walmart stores in our markets  and increasing awareness of our value proposition to potential customers in our markets 
however  we believe that the gross additions to our postpaid subscriber base could be hindered by our operational challenges we face with our rural and geographically dispersed markets as well as by challenges in obtaining some of the more popular handset devices 
our overall us retail wireless churn decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this improvement was the result of our ability to better control customer care and other churn factors since the end of the alltel transition period 
however  our churn may increase in the near term as we are in a period of higher than normal contract expirations 
this  along with our challenges in obtaining the most popular handset devices  could lead to a decline in subscriber levels 
wholesale revenue the wholesale portion of our us wireless revenue decreased slightly from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  while an increase in data volume led to an increase in data traffic  this was entirely offset during the year as the industry wide trend of lower voice traffic continued 
in addition  verizon and at t network overbuilds following their acquisition of former alltel properties contributed to our declined in revenue for the segment 
we expect that data volume may increase in the next several quarters as customer usage of data and smart phone penetration continues to increase 
such increase  however  may be completely offset by a number of factors  including any reductions in the roaming rates that we charge  continued declines in overall voice traffic or decisions by our roaming partners to no longer roam on our networks or to expand their networks in areas where we operate 
in addition  in the near term  it is unlikely we will be able to replace the approximate million of revenue we derived from our wholesale network in the midwest that we sold to a roaming partner in late december although we are embarking on some network upgrades and expansions in that should benefit wholesale revenue before the end of international wireless revenue 
international wireless revenue includes retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenue from our operations in bermuda and the caribbean  including the us virgin islands 

table of contents international wireless revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  due mainly to our bermuda merger in and subscriber growth in the us virgin islands in this increase was partially offset by a decrease in roaming revenue in certain of our other international operations 
while we have experienced subscriber growth in a number of our international markets  competition remains strong  and due to the fact that the majority of our international wireless subscribers are prepaid subscribers  revenue and subscriber levels could shift relatively quickly in future periods 
wireline revenue 
wireline revenue is generated by our wireline operations in guyana  including international telephone calls into and out of that country  our integrated voice and data operations in new england and our wholesale transport operations in new york state 
this revenue includes basic service fees  measured service revenue  and internet access fees  as well as installation charges for new lines  monthly line rental charges  long distance or toll charges  maintenance and equipment sales 
wireline revenue decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million in the prior year 
the reductions of revenue in our enterprise business and in our international long distance business in guyana were partially offset by the growth in our data revenue in guyana and in our wholesale transport revenue in the united states 
we are in the process of expanding our fiber networks in new york and vermont and as of december  have received million of the million new york based stimulus grant awarded to us in late and million of the million stimulus grant in connection with the expansion of our fiber network in vermont 
we expect to complete the construction of these expansions by the end of we anticipate that wireline revenue from our international long distance business in guyana will be negatively impacted  principally through the loss of market share  if we cease to be the exclusive provider of domestic fixed and international long distance service in guyana  whether by reason of the government of guyana enacting legislation to such effect or a modification  revocation or lack of enforcement of our exclusive rights 
while the loss of our exclusive rights will likely cause an immediate reduction in our wireline revenue  over the longer term such pressure on our wireline revenue may be offset by increased revenue from data services to consumers and enterprises in guyana  and wholesale transport services and large enterprise and agency sales in the united states 
we currently cannot predict when or if the government of guyana will enact such legislation or take  or fail to take  any action that would otherwise affect our exclusive rights in guyana 
see business guyana regulation 
equipment and other revenue 
equipment and other revenue represent revenue from wireless equipment sales  primarily handsets to retail customers  and other miscellaneous revenue items 
equipment and other revenue increased by million  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  equipment revenue in our us wireless segment increased as the result of an increase in gross subscriber additions and an increase in smartphone sales 
equipment and other revenue also increased in our international integrated telephony segment due to increased smartphone sales 
we believe that equipment and other revenue could continue to increase as a large portion of the two year contracts with alltel subscribers continue to expire  resulting in increased upgrades 
in addition  an increase in gross subscriber additions  more aggressive device subsidies and the continued growth in smartphone penetration could result in increased equipment revenues in future periods 
such increases in both gross subscriber additions and equipment revenues could be hindered by our challenges in obtaining some of the more popular handset devices 

table of contents termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fee expenses are charges that we pay for voice and data transport circuits in particular  the circuits between our wireless sites and our switches  internet capacity and other access fees we pay to terminate our calls  as well as customer bad debt expense 
termination and access fees decreased by million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in roaming expenses  decreased customer bad debt expense  and the elimination of duplicate costs from the alltel transition in our us wireless segment 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in data usage volume which increases backhaul costs as well as an increase in circuit costs within our us wireline segment as our network continues to expand 
termination and access fees are expected to increase in future periods with expected growth in volume  but remain fairly proportionate to their related revenue as our networks expand 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating and supporting our expanding networks  including the salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the development and operation of our networks 
engineering and operations expenses increased million  or  from million to million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
network expansions in our international integrated telephony and island wireless segments in and increased our engineering and operations expenses  however  these were partially offset when we eliminated the redundant costs incurred in our alltel transition 
we expect that engineering and operations expenses will be roughly proportional to the geographic size and technological capabilities of our network  and may increase over time as we increase our network capacity and capabilities  as well as through geographic expansion 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries and benefits we pay to sales personnel  customer service expenses  sales commissions and the costs associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was the result of the elimination of expenses associated with the alltel transition and the increased promotional expenses in relating to our cellone brand re launch in bermuda 
these decreases  however  were partially offset by a rise in sales and marketing expenses in our international integrated telephony segment as a result of increased promotional campaigns 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue for the short term as we continue to incur promotional and retention costs in an attempt to offset customer churn and increase gross customer additions in our us wireless segment 
in the longer term  these costs should decrease as a percentage of revenue 
equipment expenses 
equipment expenses include the costs of our handset and customer resale equipment in our retail wireless businesses 
equipment expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is largely the result of higher gross subscriber additions and an increase in smartphone sales in our us wireless and international integrated telephony segments 
a decline in equipment expenses in bermuda during the past year  as compared to the increased expenses we incurred in connection with the bermuda merger in  partially offset these increases in we believe that equipment expenses could continue to rise in the first half of as a large portion of our two year contracts with alltel subscribers will be expiring  resulting in more upgrades as 
table of contents compared to and due to increased demand for more expensive smartphone handset devices 
we may also choose  from time to time  to raise device subsidies to attract and retain customers 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  benefits and related costs for general corporate functions including executive management  finance and administration  legal and regulatory  facilities  information technology and human resources 
general and administrative expenses also include internal costs associated with our performance of due diligence on our pending or completed acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the completion of the alltel transition 
during this transition period  we incurred a significant overlap of certain general and administrative expenses 
these expense declines were partially offset by an increase in expenses in bermuda in as a result of the bermuda merger in and an increase in corporate overhead expenses 
we expect that these general and administrative expenses will remain fairly consistent as a percentage of revenues in future periods 
acquisition and disposition related charges 
acquisition and disposition related charges include the external costs  such as legal  accounting  and consulting fees directly associated with acquisition and disposition related activities  which are expensed as incurred 
acquisition and disposition related charges do not include internal costs  such as employee salary and travel related expenses  incurred in connection with acquisitions or dispositions or any integration related costs 
we incurred million of acquisition and disposition related charges for the year ended december  and million of acquisition and disposition related charges for the year ended december  we expect that acquisition and disposition related expenses will continue to be incurred from time to time as we continue to work towards completion of the alltel sale and to explore additional acquisition opportunities 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses represent the depreciation and amortization charges we record on our property and equipment and on certain intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to additional fixed assets associated with the development of operational and business support systems which were put in service at the end of the alltel transition as well as the addition of tangible and intangible assets acquired in our bermuda merger 
we expect depreciation expense to continue to increase as we acquire more tangible assets to expand or upgrade our networks 
such increase  however  will be partially offset by a future decrease in the amortization of our intangible assets  which are being amortized using an accelerated amortization method 
impairment of intangible assets 
we performed our annual impairment assessment of our telecommunications licenses as of december  and determined that one of our telecommunications licenses used in our island wireless segment was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge for the entire million net book value of the license during the year ended december  gain on disposition of long lived assets 
during the year ended december   we sold certain network assets and spectrum in the midwestern united states used in our wholesale us 
table of contents wireless business for proceeds of million and recognized a gain on such disposition of million 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest incurred on our outstanding credit facilities including our interest rate swaps 
interest expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to a reduction in our outstanding debt and decreases in applicable margins as a result of amendments to our credit facilities effective september  and may  as of december   we had million in outstanding debt as compared to million as of december  interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
an increase in our cash balances during was offset by a reduction in the interest rates that we earned on those balances 
as a result  interest income remained consistent at million for the years ended december  and equity in earnings of an unconsolidated affiliate 
equity in earnings of an unconsolidated affiliate is related to a minority owned investment in our us wireless segment 
equity in earnings of an unconsolidated affiliate was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  other income expense  net 
other income expense  net represents miscellaneous non operational income we earned or expenses we incurred 
other income expense  net was million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
income taxes 
our effective tax rates for the year ended december  and were and  respectively 
our effective tax rate declined in as the result of an increased proportional share of income in lower taxed jurisdictions  such as bermuda and the us  as compared to in addition  we recorded a million benefit  net of reserves  relating to us research and development tax credits claimed for and that positively impacted the effective tax rate by approximately 
excluding the research and development tax credits  our effective tax rates were higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of due primarily to i the portion of our earnings that are taxed in guyana at  and ii the portion of our earnings that include losses generated in non tax foreign jurisdictions for which we receive no tax benefit 
our consolidated tax rate will continue to be impacted by the shift in the mix of income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
net income attributable to non controlling interests 
net loss attributable to non controlling interests reflected an allocation of million and million of income generated by our less than wholly owned subsidiaries for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was the result of an increase in income generated by our less than wholly owned subsidiary in bermuda due to the bermuda merger in net income attributable to atlantic tele network  inc stockholders 
net income attributable to atlantic tele network  inc stockholders increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  on a per share basis  net income increased to per diluted share from per diluted share for the year ended december  and  respectively

stockholders us wireless revenue 
retail revenue the retail portion of our us wireless revenue was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was the result of representing a full year of operations of our alltel 
table of contents acquisition  which we completed in april  and was partially offset by a decrease in subscribers during the period subsequent to the acquisition 
as of december   we had approximately  us retail wireless subscribers including  postpaid subscribers and  prepaid subscribers  a decrease of  from the approximate  subscribers we had as of december  in addition to ordinary competitive forces  the decrease in subscribers was due to tightening of credit and contract policies post alltel acquisition  the loss of a significant prepaid distribution channel  the high percentage of subscribers with expiring contracts due to our predecessor emphasis on one year customer contracts and a number of other factors 
among these other factors were the effects of separating our markets from the formerly unified alltel market  leaving many of our subscribers near the edge or outside of our licensed territory 
wholesale revenue the wholesale portion of our us wireless revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in wireless wholesale revenue was primarily due to a full year of operations from our alltel acquisition  which we completed in april  as well as an increase in data usage from both our legacy us roaming network and the alltel network 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of the overlapping of our networks with those of verizon and at t  as well as a decline in voice traffic and the rates we charge certain carrier customers 
international wireless revenue 
international wireless revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from our completion of the bermuda merger in and a full year of new services that were launched in other caribbean countries during the increase was also the result of a million increase in wireless revenues in guyana as a result of increased voice and data usage 
wireline revenue 
wireline revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in guyana  a million decrease in international long distance revenue was partially offset by data revenue growth 
the number of access lines in guyana increased by  from approximately  lines as of december  to approximately  lines as of december  and we experienced higher internet revenues during the year ended december  from our newly built fiber optic submarine cable in guyana 
wireline revenue in the us remained relatively consistent compared with the previous year as we saw increased revenue from our upstate new york wholesale transport service business 
we continued to add business customers in the us for our voice and data services  however  the overall revenue increase was offset by a decline in the residential data business in vermont and new hampshire  including dial up internet services 
equipment and other revenue 
equipment and other revenue decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   down from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the substantial completion of our transition of the alltel subscribers from one year contracts to the more traditional two year contracts resulting in fewer upgrades in as compared to the decrease was partially offset by increased equipment sales in bermuda  mainly as a result of the bermuda merger 
termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fees increased by million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  such increase reflects a full year of operations of the alltel acquisition as well as 
table of contents the bermuda merger 
the increase in termination and access fees was also the result of an increase in call and data volume  partially offset by a decrease in customer bad debt expense 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of the period reflecting a full year of operations from our alltel acquisition 
engineering and operations also increased as a result of the completion of our bermuda merger in may such increase  however  was partially offset by the completion of the alltel transition in july which eliminated significant duplicate and transition related expenses we had been incurring since april in addition  engineering and operations expenses increased in due to the expansion of networks and a full year of results in for the launches of new services at many of our international subsidiaries 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of the alltel acquisition

in addition  sales and marketing expenses increased in as a result of the bermuda merger 
equipment expenses 
equipment expenses decreased by million from million  or  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was impacted by the accelerated pace of customer contract renewals and extensions we experienced in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of the period reflecting a full year of operations from our alltel acquisition

acquisition related charges 
for the year ended december   acquisition related charges were million  as compared to the million incurred in connection with the alltel acquisition during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the addition of the tangible and intangible assets acquired with the alltel acquisition and bermuda merger as well as additional fixed assets from our network expansion in our us wireless and island wireless businesses 
impairment of goodwill 
we performed our annual impairment assessment of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  the prolonged economic downturn caused slower growth in new subscribers in one of the reporting units in our island wireless segment  which contributed to a decline in expected future cash flows 
as a result  we determined that the book value of this reporting unit exceeded its fair value and concluded that the entire goodwill recorded by that reporting unit was impaired 
in connection with this assessment  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million during the year ended december  gain on disposition of long lived assets 
during the year ended december   we sold certain network assets related to a less than wholly owned subsidiary within our wholesale us wireless business for proceeds of million and recognized a gain on such disposition of million as such assets were fully depreciated

for a discussion of regulatory risks in guyana that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity  see risk factors risks relating to our wireless and wireline services in guyana  and business guyana regulation

in addition  the amended credit facility contains financial covenants by us that i impose a maximum ratio of indebtedness to ebitda ii require a minimum ratio of ebitda to principal and interest payments and cash taxes and  iii require a minimum ratio of equity to consolidated assets 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the amended credit facility  as amended 
capital markets 
our ability to raise funds in the capital markets depends on  among other things  general economic conditions  the conditions of the telecommunications industry  our financial performance  the state of the capital markets and our compliance with securities and exchange commission sec requirements for the offering of securities 
on may   the sec declared effective our universal shelf registration statement 
this filing registered potential future offerings of our securities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated operations in any of the periods presented in the report 
critical accounting estimates we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
we base our estimates on our operating experience and on various conditions existing in the market and we believe them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of materially impacting our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize for a particular transaction  we apply the criteria established by the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition and defer those items that do not meet the recognition criteria 
as a result of the cutoff times of our billing cycles  we are often required to estimate the amount of revenues earned but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and historical evidence with each customer or carrier 
adjustments affecting revenue can and occasionally do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue  however historically these adjustments have not been material 
a small portion of our revenue is attributable to activation or reactivation fees  installation fees and equipment sales 
we evaluate these and  where the amounts charged for such services or the 
table of contents equipment do not represent a separate unit of accounting  these amounts are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer relationship period 
we apply judgment when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of customers 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers collection experience  aging of the accounts receivable  the credit quality of customer and  where necessary  other macro economic factors 
long lived and intangible assets 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance regarding the accounting for impairments or disposals of long lived assets and the authoritative guidance for the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to non current assets subject to depreciation and amortization and discounted cash flows for intangible assets not subject to amortization are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management assumptions and projections 
our estimates of the future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets and the fair value of our businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
if those estimates are not met  we could have additional impairment charges in the future  and the amounts may be material 
we also assess the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of each reporting unit  including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit  is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
impairment of intangible assets 
we assess the recoverability of the value of our fcc licenses using a market approach 
we believe that our fcc licenses have an indefinite life based on historical ability to renew such licenses  that such renewals may be obtained indefinitely and at little cost  and that the related technology used is not expected to be replaced in the foreseeable future 
if the value of these assets was impaired by some factor  such as an adverse change in the subsidiary operating market  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of fcc licenses with their carrying amount on a license by license basis 
we performed our annual impairment assessment of our telecommunications licenses as of december   and it was determined that no impairment of any of our telecommunications licenses existed during the year ended december  except for one of our reporting units in the island wireless segment 
the impairment arose from a culmination of factors arising from poor economic conditions in the geographic region which resulted in a fair value determination that was below the book value of the reporting unit telecommunications license 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million during the year ended december  the cash flow assumptions used in the level valuation included a discount rate of  a cash flow period of years and a terminal value determined based on projected long range inflation and long term industry projections of 
if earnings forecast assumptions increased by or the discount rate decreased by  the impairment would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
as the related license was fully impaired  any decrease in the earnings forecasts or increase in the discount rate would have no impact on the level of impairment 

table of contents contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  tax audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accruals required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter 
we estimate these contingencies amount to approximately million at december   the majority of which are not recorded on our books as we do not believe that an adverse outcome is probable 
adverse developments in these matters may result in the recording of liabilities to satisfy all or a portion of these claims 
the company believes some adverse outcome is probable and has accordingly accrued million as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance which requires companies to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their financial statements or footnotes 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of the new guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued new guidance intended to simplify the impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
under this guidance  an entity is allowed to perform a qualitative assessment about the likelihood of impairment of an indefinite lived intangible asset to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary  similar in approach to the goodwill impairment test 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  we do not believe the adoption of the new guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this new guidance amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased disclosures regarding valuation inputs and investment categorization 
the adoption of this new accounting guidance in did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange sensitivity 
the only material foreign currency for which we have a material exposure is in guyana 
the functional currency we use in guyana is the us dollar because a significant portion of our guyana revenues and expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
however  the guyanese exchange rate has remained at approximately guyana dollars to us dollar since  and as a result  we have not recorded any foreign exchange gains or losses since that date 
all of our other foreign subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where the us dollar is the recognized currency 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited and relates primarily to our variable interest rate long term debt 
as of december   million of our long term debt had a fixed rate million by way of interest rate swaps that effectively hedge our interest rate risk 
the remaining million of long term debt as of december  was subject to interest rate risk 
as a result of our hedging policy  we believe our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is not material
