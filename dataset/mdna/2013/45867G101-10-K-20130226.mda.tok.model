item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in this form k 
business interdigital designs and develops advanced technologies that enable and enhance wireless communications and capabilities 
since our founding in  we have designed and developed a wide range of innovations that are used in digital cellular and wireless products and networks  including g  g  g and ieee related products and networks 
we are a leading contributor of intellectual property to the wireless communications industry 

table of contents given our long history and focus on advanced research and development  interdigital has amassed one of the most significant patent portfolios in the wireless industry 
as of december   interdigital wholly owned subsidiaries held a portfolio of over  patents and patent applications related to the fundamental technologies that enable wireless communications 
in that portfolio are a number of patents and patent applications that we believe are or may be essential or may become essential to cellular and other wireless standards  including the g  g  g and the ieee suite of standards 
that portfolio has largely been built through internal development  supplemented by joint development projects with other companies as well as select patent acquisitions 
products incorporating our patented inventions include mobile devices  such as cellular phones  tablets  notebook computers and wireless personal digital assistants  wireless infrastructure equipment  such as base stations  and components  dongles and modules for wireless devices 
interdigital derives revenues primarily from patent licensing and sales  technology solutions licensing and sales and engineering services 
in  and  our total revenues were million  million and million  respectively 
in  we recorded million of revenue related to the sale of less than ten percent of our patent portfolio 
our patent licensing revenues in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
in  the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments accounted for approximately of our patent licensing revenues 
these fixed fee revenues are not affected by the related licensees success in the market or the general economic climate 
the majority of the remaining portion of our patent licensing revenue is variable in nature due to the per unit structure of the related license agreements 
approximately of this per unit  variable portion for related to sales by two of our licensees with concentrations in the smartphone market and our collection of japanese licensees  for whom the majority of the sales are within japan 
as a result  our per unit  variable patent license royalties have been  and will continue to be  largely influenced by the sales performance of these licensees 
strategic alternatives review and expansion of business strategy on july   we announced that our board of directors had initiated a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives for the company  including a sale or other transaction 
we announced on january   that our board of directors had concluded its review of strategic alternatives for the company and determined that it was in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to execute on the company business plan and to expand the plan to include patent sales and patent licensing partnerships as additional vehicles to generate revenue 
on october   we announced a further expansion of our business strategy by enhancing our technology sourcing and establishing a business unit  interdigital solutions  dedicated to monetizing the company market ready technologies and research capabilities 
for additional information regarding the company business strategy  see part i  item  of this form k 
repositioning on october   we announced that  as part of our ongoing expense management  we had initiated a voluntary early retirement program verp 
in connection with the verp  we incurred a related repositioning charge of million in during  cash payments of million were made for severance and related costs associated with the verp 
we have accrued million for severance and related costs at the balance sheet date 
the million charge is included within the repositioning line of our consolidated statements of income 
approximately employees elected to participate in the verp across our locations  the majority of whose last day was december  the majority of the charge recorded in represents cash obligations associated with severance 
we expect to recognize an additional million to million charge related to the verp in all of the severance and related costs are scheduled to be paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
we did not incur any repositioning charges during or patent sales on june   we announced that certain of our subsidiaries had entered into a definitive agreement to sell approximately  patents and patent applications  including approximately issued us patents and approximately us patent applications  to intel corporation for million 
the sale agreement involved patents primarily related to g  lte and technologies 
upon completion of the transaction in third quarter  we recognized million as patent sales revenue and million as patent sales expense  which was recorded within the patent administration and licensing line on our consolidated statements of income 
included in the patent sales expense was the remaining net book value of the patents sold  as well as commissions and legal and accounting services fees paid in conjunction with the sale 
we intend to pursue additional patent sale opportunities as part of our expanded strategy 
however  we are unable to predict the timing and magnitude of any such sales due to the unpredictable nature of the sales cycle for such transactions 

table of contents patent license agreements in fourth quarter  we entered into an agreement that extends the term of our worldwide  non exclusive  royalty bearing patent license agreement with blackberry 
in addition to extending the patent license agreement for a multi year period  the parties agreed to amend the patent license to add coverage for g products  including lte and lte advanced products 
also in fourth quarter  we entered into a patent license agreement with sony that covers sony sale of g and g products 
additionally  during  we entered into new or expanded patent license agreements with u blox ag  cinterion wireless modules gmbh  sierra wireless  inc  acer inc  pantech co 
ltd  wistron corporation and quanta computers  inc these agreements cover various wireless modules for consumer electronics and mm devices  including handsets  wireless modules  computers and tablets designed to operate in accordance with g wireless technologies  lte  lte advanced and wimax standards  in addition to g and g wireless technologies 
expiration of patent license agreement with samsung in  we recognized the remaining million of revenue associated with the samsung pla 
the samsung pla covered the sale of single mode terminal units and infrastructure designed to operate in accordance with tdma based g standards  which portion of the license became paid up in  and the sale of terminal units and infrastructure designed to operate in accordance with g standards through pursuant to the samsung pla  samsung paid interdigital million in four equal installments over an month period 
samsung paid the first two million installments in we received the third and fourth million installments in january and july  respectively 
upon expiration of the samsung pla  samsung retained its paid up license to sell single mode terminal units and infrastructure designed to operate in accordance with tdma based g standards and became unlicensed as to all other products covered under the agreement 
in january  we filed a complaint with the usitc against samsung and seven other respondents  alleging that they engaged in unfair trade practices by selling for importation into the united states  importing into the united states and or selling after importation into the united states certain g and g wireless devices that infringe up to seven of interdigital us patents 
patent licensing royalties patent licensing royalties in of million decreased from the prior year 
this million year over year decrease in patent licensing royalties was primarily driven by a decrease in royalties from our japanese per unit licensees and lower shipments from our per unit licensees with concentrations in the smartphone market 
refer to results of operations compared with for further discussion of our revenue 
technology solutions and engineering services we are engaged in arbitration to determine whether royalties are owed on specific product classes pursuant to one of our technology solutions agreements 
as of december  and december   we have deferred related revenue of million and million  respectively 
these amounts have either been collected or recorded in accounts receivable on their respective balance sheet dates

cash and short term investments at december   we had million of cash and short term investments and an additional million of fixed or prepayments due under agreements signed  including million recorded in accounts receivable as it is due within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
a substantial portion of this balance relates to fixed and prepaid royalty payments we have received that relate to future sales of our licensees products 
as a result  our cash receipts from existing licenses subject to fixed and prepaid royalties will be reduced in future periods 
during  we recorded million of cash receipts related to patent licensing  technology solutions agreements and patent sales as follows in thousands cash in fixed royalty payments current royalties and past sales prepaid royalties technology solutions patent sales the million of fixed fee and prepaid royalty cash receipts  together with a million accrual of accounts receivable related to scheduled prepaid royalties and fixed fee payments  partially offset the million in deferred revenue recognized  resulting in a net million decrease in deferred revenue to million at december  approximately million of our million deferred revenue balance relates to fixed royalty payments that are scheduled to amortize as follows in thousands thereafter the remaining million of deferred revenue primarily relates to prepaid royalties that will be recorded as revenue as our licensees report their sales of covered products and prepaid royalties that may be recorded as revenue upon the resolution of the arbitration related to one of our technology solutions agreements 
repurchase of common stock during  we repurchased a cumulative total of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million under the repurchase program and the repurchase program  each as defined below 
we made no share repurchases during or in march  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program the repurchase program 
the company repurchased shares under the repurchase program through pre arranged trading plans 
during  we repurchased million shares under the repurchase program for million 
the repurchase program 
table of contents was completed in second quarter  bringing the cumulative repurchase total under the program to approximately million shares at a cost of million 
in may  our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program  which was then expanded in june to increase the amount of the program from million to million the repurchase program 
the company may repurchase shares under the repurchase program through open market purchases  pre arranged trading plans or privately negotiated purchases 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares under the repurchase program for million 
from january  through february   we did not make any share repurchases under the repurchase program 
intellectual property rights enforcement if we believe any party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture and sell certain products and such party refuses to do so  we may institute legal action against them 
this legal action typically takes the form of a patent infringement lawsuit or an administrative proceeding such as a section proceeding before the usitc 
in addition  we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  might seek to resolve disagreements between the parties with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable license agreement through arbitration or litigation 
in  our intellectual property enforcement costs increased to million from million and million in and  respectively 
the amount includes a million increase to accrue for a litigation contingency related to the huawei china proceedings 
this represented of our total patent administration and licensing costs of million 
intellectual property enforcement costs will vary depending upon activity levels  and it is likely they will continue to be a significant expense for us in the future 
comparability of financial results when comparing financial results against other periods  the following items should be taken into consideration our revenue includes million of revenue associated with patent sales  and million of past sales related to a new patent license agreement with sony  new and amended agreements signed during and revenue associated with the audits of existing licensees 
our operating expenses include million of expense related our patent sales  million of expense associated with actions to reposition the company operations  million charge to increase the accrual rate under our long term compensation program ltcp for the program cycle ending december   and lower accrual rates as compared to for the remaining two active cycles under the ltcp  million tax benefit for release of valuation allowances on dta 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in both our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from these estimates and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements and are included in item of part ii of this form k 
we believe the accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment in their application compared to others are those relating to revenue recognition  compensation and income taxes 
if different assumptions were made or different conditions existed  our financial results could have been materially different 

table of contents revenue recognition we derive the vast majority of our revenue from patent licensing 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
such agreements are often complex and include multiple elements 
these agreements can include  without limitation  elements related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities  up front and non refundable license fees for the use of patents and or know how  patent and or know how licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees  cross licensing terms between us and other parties  the compensation structure and ownership of intellectual property rights associated with contractual technology development arrangements  advanced payments and fees for service arrangements and settlement of intellectual property enforcement 
for agreements entered into or materially modified prior to  due to the inherent difficulty in establishing reliable  verifiable  and objectively determinable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements of these agreements  the total revenue resulting from such agreements has often been recognized over the performance period 
beginning in january  all new or materially modified agreements are being accounted for under the financial accounting standards board fasb revenue recognition guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance requires consideration to be allocated to each element of an agreement that has stand alone value using the relative fair value method 
in other circumstances  such as those agreements involving consideration for past and expected future patent royalty obligations  after consideration of the particular facts and circumstances  the appropriate recording of revenue between periods may require the use of judgment 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met written agreements have been executed  delivery of technology or intellectual property rights has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility of fees is reasonably assured 
we establish a receivable for payments expected to be received within twelve months from the balance sheet date based on the terms in the license 
our reporting of such payments often results in an increase to both accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
deferred revenue associated with fixed fee royalty payments is classified on the balance sheet as short term when it is scheduled to be amortized within twelve months from the balance sheet date 
all other deferred revenue is classified as long term  as amounts to be recognized over the next twelve months are not known 
patent license agreements upon signing a patent license agreement  we provide the licensee permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications 
we account for patent license agreements in accordance with the guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and the guidance for revenue recognition 
we have elected to utilize the leased based model for revenue recognition  with revenue being recognized over the expected period of benefit to the licensee 
under our patent license agreements  we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in their applications and products consideration for past sales consideration related to a licensee s product sales from prior periods may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement 
we may also receive consideration for past sales in connection with the settlement of patent litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement 
in each of these cases  we record the consideration as revenue when we have obtained a signed agreement  identified a fixed or determinable price and determined that collectibility is reasonably assured 
fixed fee royalty payments these are up front  non refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee s obligations to us under a patent license agreement for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement for specified products  under certain patents or patent claims  for sales in certain countries  or a combination thereof in each case for a specified time period including for the life of the patents licensed under the agreement 
we recognize revenues related to fixed fee royalty payments on a straight line basis over the effective term of the license 
we utilize the straight line method because we cannot reliably predict in which periods  within the term of a license  the licensee will benefit from the use of our patented inventions 
prepayments these are up front  non refundable royalty payments towards a licensee s future obligations to us related to its expected sales of covered products in future periods 
our licensees obligations to pay royalties typically extend beyond the exhaustion of their prepayment balance 
once a licensee exhausts its prepayment balance  we may provide them with the opportunity to make another prepayment toward future sales or it will be required to make current royalty payments 
current royalty payments these are royalty payments covering a licensee s obligations to us related to its sales of covered products in the current contractual reporting period 
licensees that either owe us current royalty payments or have prepayment balances are obligated to provide us with quarterly or semi annual royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to 
table of contents us 
we typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees underlying sales occurred 
as a result  it is impractical for us to recognize revenue in the period in which the underlying sales occur  and  in most cases  we recognize revenue in the period in which the royalty report is received and other revenue recognition criteria are met due to the fact that without royalty reports from our licensees  our visibility into our licensees sales is very limited 
the exhaustion of prepayments and current royalty payments are often calculated based on related per unit sales of covered products 
from time to time  licensees will not report revenues in the proper period  most often due to legal disputes 
when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenue could be affected 
in cases where we receive objective  verifiable evidence that a licensee has discontinued sales of products covered under a patent license agreement with us  we recognize any related deferred revenue balance in the period that we receive such evidence 
patent sales during  we expanded our business strategy of monetizing our intellectual property to include the sale of select patent assets 
as patent sales executed under this expanded strategy represent a component of our ongoing major or central operations and activities  we will record the related proceeds as revenue 
we will recognize the revenue when there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these requirements are generally fulfilled upon closing of the patent sale transaction 
technology solutions and engineering services technology solutions revenue consists primarily of revenue from software licenses and engineering services 
software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the original and revised guidance for software revenue recognition 
when the arrangement with a customer includes significant production  modification  or customization of the software  we recognize the related revenue using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the accounting guidance for construction type and certain production type contracts 
under this method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based on actual labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs related to the contract 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when such estimates indicate that costs will exceed future revenues and a loss on the contract exists  a provision for the entire loss is recognized at that time 
we recognize revenues associated with engineering service arrangements that are outside the scope of the accounting guidance for construction type and certain production type contracts on a straight line basis  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed  whichever is longer 
in such cases we often recognize revenue using proportional performance and measure the progress of our performance based on the relationship between incurred labor hours and total estimated labor hours or other measures of progress  if available 
our most significant cost has been labor and we believe both labor hours and labor cost provide a measure of the progress of our services 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the period such changes are determined 
when technology solutions agreements include royalty payments  we recognize revenue from the royalty payments using the same methods described above under our policy for recognizing revenue from patent license agreements 
sony agreement on december   we formed a joint venture with sony corporation of america to combine sony consumer electronics expertise with our wireless mm and bandwidth management research 
the joint venture  called convida wireless  will focus on driving new research in mm wireless communications and other connectivity areas 
based on the terms of the agreement  the parties will contribute funding and resources for additional mm research and platform development  which we will perform 
stephens capital partners llc stephens  the principal investing affiliate of stephens inc  is a minority investor in convida wireless 
our agreement with sony is a multiple element arrangement that also includes a three year license to our patents for sony sale of g and g products  effective january   and an amount for past sales 
under the arrangement  we expect to collect a total of million of cash and have also acquired certain patents covering non baseband technologies from sony 
we have estimated the value of the acquired patents to be million 
we estimated the fair value of patents by a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis the income approach and an analysis of comparable market transactions the market approach 
for the income approach  the inputs and assumptions used to develop this estimate were based on a market participant perspective and included estimates of projected royalties  discount rates  useful lives and income tax rates  among others 
for the market approach  judgment was applied as to which market transactions were 
table of contents most comparable to this transaction 
these inputs and assumptions represent our best estimates at the time of the transaction 
changes in any number of these assumptions may have had a substantial impact on the estimated value of the acquired patents 
in connection with this arrangement  we recognized million of patent licensing revenue in fourth quarter  and we expect to recognize million of patent licensing revenue  using the straight line method  over the three year term of the patent license 
the remaining million represents funding toward mm research and platform development 
convida wireless is a variable interest entity 
based on our provision of mm research and platform development services to convida wireless  we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes and must consolidate convida wireless 
because convida wireless had no operations in  the consolidation of convida wireless had no impact on our financial statements as of december   and there was no income or loss to allocate to interests held by other parties 
the agreement is a multiple element arrangement for accounting purposes 
as discussed in our revenue recognition policy footnote  we identified each element of the arrangement and determined when those elements should be recognized 
using the accounting guidance from multiple element revenue arrangements  we allocated the consideration to each element for accounting purposes using our best estimate of selling price for each element 
the development of a number of these inputs and assumptions in the model requires a significant amount of management judgment and is based upon a number of factors  including the selection of industry comparables  market growth rates and other relevant factors 
changes in any number of these assumptions may have had a substantial impact on the fair value as assigned to each element for accounting purposes 
these inputs and assumptions represent management best estimates at the time of the transaction 
the impact that a five percent change in each of the following key estimates would have had on fourth quarter revenue and pretax income is summarized in the following table in millions change in estimate value of patents acquired allocation between past and future royalties compensation programs we use a variety of compensation programs to both attract and retain employees  and to more closely align employee compensation with company performance 
these programs include  but are not limited to  short term incentive awards tied to performance goals and cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances  as well as  prior to  restricted stock unit rsu awards for non managers and the ltcp for managers  which included both time based and performance based rsus and a performance based cash incentive component 
prior to  ltcp awards would alternate annually between rsu and cash cycles  each of which generally covered a three year period and could overlap with another cycle by as many as two years 
in fourth quarter  the ltcp was amended to  among other things  increase the relative proportion of performance based compensation for executives and managers  extend participation to all employees  and eliminate alternating rsu and cash cycles 
effective with the cycle that began on january  through december   executives and managers received of their ltcp participation in the form of time based rsus that vest in full at the end of the respective three year cycle and the remaining in the form of performance based awards granted under the long term incentive plan ltip component of the ltcp 
ltip performance based awards may be paid out in the form of cash  equity or any combination thereof  as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors

the following table provides examples of the performance based rsu payout that would have been earned based on various levels of goal achievement payout scenarios under prior ltcp program goal achievement payout less than or greater income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters  including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable tax authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
during fourth quarter  we completed a study to assess the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryovers into the tax year as a result of the study  we amended our united states federal income tax returns for the periods to reclassify million of foreign tax payments we made during those periods from deductions to foreign tax credits 
we also amended our federal tax returns for the periods to utilize the resulting tax credits 
when we completed the study  we established a basis to support amending the returns and estimated that the maximum incremental benefit would be million 
we recognized a net benefit of million after establishing a million reserve for related tax contingencies 
in  we recorded an additional tax benefit of million to eliminate this million reserve and other tax contingencies and recognize interest income on the associated refund 
between and  we paid approximately million in foreign taxes for which we have claimed foreign tax credits against our us tax obligations 
it is possible that as a result of tax treaty procedures  the us government may reach an agreement with the related foreign governments that will result in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits 
due to both foreign currency fluctuations and differences in the interest rate charged by the us government compared to the interest rates  if any  used by the foreign governments  any such agreement could result in interest expense and or foreign currency gain or loss 

table of contents new accounting guidance accounting standards updates fair value measurements amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that is more closely aligned with the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance issued by the international accounting standards board iasb 
the issuance of this standard results in global fair value measurement and disclosure guidance that minimizes the differences between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
many of the changes in the final standard represent clarifications to existing guidance  while some changes related to the valuation premise and the application of premiums and discounts and new required disclosures are more significant 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance effective january   however  the adoption of this guidance does not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements or related disclosures 
accounting standards updates presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring most entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity was eliminated 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance effective january  we have chosen to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements 
on december   the fasb issued an amendment to the new standard on comprehensive income to defer the requirement to measure and present reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income by income statement line item in net income and also in other comprehensive income 
the deferred requirement would have called for the measurement and presentation in net income of items previously recognized in other comprehensive income 
in february  the fasb issued final guidance on the presentation of reclassifications out of other comprehensive income 
the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the income statement or in a footnote  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  only if the amount reclassified is required by gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under gaap that provide detail about those amounts 
this amendment is effective for interim and fiscal years beginning after december  the amended standard will not impact the company financial position or results of operations

upon the closing of the transaction in third quarter  we received million of cash and recorded this amount as revenue 
driven by this transaction  we made an estimated federal tax payment of approximately million in fourth quarter we have and expect to continue to use the net proceeds discussed above for general corporate purposes  which may include  among other things acquisitions of intellectual property related assets or businesses or securities in such businesses  capital expenditures  payment of cash dividends  funding of our existing stock repurchase program and working capital 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  and december   we had the following amounts of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in thousands december  december  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily attributable to the cost of repurchasing of common stock of million  dividend payments of million and million in capital investments  which were partially offset by million of cash provided by operating activities 
cash flows from operations we generated or used the following cash flows from our operating activities in and in thousands for the year ended december  increase decrease cash flows provided used in by operating activities the positive operating cash flow during was derived principally from cash receipts of million from patent sales and patent license and technology solutions agreements

cash receipts from our technology solutions agreements totaled million  primarily related to royalties and other license fees associated with our slimchip modem core 
in addition  we received million in tax refunds  including interest income  as a result of amendments of previously filed tax returns 
working capital we believe that working capital  adjusted to exclude cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and current deferred revenue provides additional information about non cash assets and liabilities that might affect our near term liquidity 

table of contents while we believe cash and short term investments are important measures of our liquidity  the remaining components of our current assets and current liabilities  with the exception of deferred revenue  could affect our near term liquidity and or cash flow 
we have no material obligations associated with our deferred revenue  and the amortization of deferred revenue has no impact on our future liquidity and or cash flow 
our adjusted working capital  a non gaap financial measure  reconciles to working capital  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  at december  and december  in thousands as follows december  december  increase decrease current assets less current liabilities working capital subtract cash and cash equivalents short term investments add current deferred revenue adjusted working capital the million increase in adjusted working capital in compared to is primarily attributable to a million increase in accounts receivable related to new and recently renewed its patent license agreements and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily related to tax receivables 
these increases were partially offset by increases to accrued compensation and other accrued expenses  primarily due to the ltcp performance cycle that ended december  and the accrued repositioning charge  respectively 
additionally  a decrease in deferred tax assets of million primarily related to timing differences in the recognition of deferred revenue for book and tax purposes helped offset the increases discussed above 
cash used in or provided by investing and financing activities we generated net cash in investing activities of million in and used million in we sold million of short term marketable securities  net of purchases in  and we purchased million of short term marketable securities  net of sales  in this increase in net sales was driven by higher cash needs primarily associated with our stock repurchase program and our cash dividends

investment costs associated with capitalized patent costs and acquisition of patent costs increased to million in from million in  primarily due to investments in patent acquisitions in net cash used in financing activities decreased by million in primarily due to our issuance of the notes and related transactions in second quarter as well as our repurchases of common stock of million and dividends paid of million in other our combined short term and long term deferred revenue balance at december  was approximately million  a decrease of million from december  we have no material obligations associated with such deferred revenue 
the decrease in deferred revenue was primarily due to million of deferred revenue recognized  partially offset by a gross increase in deferred revenue of million 
this deferred revenue recognized was comprised of million of amortized fixed fee royalty payments and million in past sales and per unit exhaustion of prepaid royalties based upon royalty reports provided by our licensees 
the gross increase in deferred revenue of million primarily related to cash received or due from patent licensees and technology solutions customers 
of the million  million relates to the technology solutions agreement arbitration discussed above in the overview section 
based on current license agreements  we expect the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments to reduce the december  deferred revenue balance of million by million over the next twelve months 
additional reductions to deferred revenue will be dependent upon the level of per unit royalties our licensees report against prepaid balances or arbitration rulings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash equivalents and investments the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time capturing a market rate of return 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government obligations  corporate bonds and commercial paper 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a number of diversified high quality investment grade fixed and floating rate securities with a fair value of million at december  our exposure to interest rate risks is not significant due to the short average maturity  quality and diversification of our holdings 
we do not hold any derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other similar financial instruments in our portfolio 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is generally 
table of contents limited to our investment portfolio 
we believe that a hypothetical change in period end interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
the following table provides information about our interest bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity average interest rates in millions thereafter total money market and demand accounts cash equivalents short term investments interest rate cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
bank liquidity risk as of december  we had approximately million in operating accounts and money market funds that are held with domestic and international financial institutions 
the majority of these balances are held with domestic financial institutions 
while we monitor daily cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be lost or become inaccessible if the underlying financial institutions fail or if they are unable to meet the liquidity requirements of their depositors 
notwithstanding  we have not incurred any losses and have had full access to our operating accounts to date 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies  which might change over time as our business practices evolve  that could impact our operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
we operate and invest globally 
adverse movements in currency exchange rates might negatively affect our business due to a number of situations 
currently  our international licensing agreements are typically made in us dollars and are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions at this time 
between and  we paid approximately million in foreign taxes for which we have claimed foreign tax credits against our us tax obligations 
it is possible that as a result of tax treaty procedures  the us government may reach an agreement with the related foreign governments that will result in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits 
due to both foreign currency fluctuations and differences in the interest rate charged by the us government compared to the interest rates  if any  used by the foreign governments  any such agreement could result in interest expense and or foreign currency gain or loss
