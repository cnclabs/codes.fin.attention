during fiscal year  we changed our reporting segments in connection with the transition to new leadership  reporting relationships and our new one layne strategy 
we previously reported results of operations under three reporting segments including the water infrastructure division  mineral exploration division and energy division 
our new reporting segments are the water resources division  inliner division  heavy civil division  geoconstruction division  mineral exploration division and energy division 
during fiscal  the company sold the exploration and production assets of the energy division 
reporting segment information and comparisons in the operating segment review of operations for prior periods have been recast to match the new reporting segment structure 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  aggregate financial commitments and certain financial condition ratios 
critical accounting policies a discussion of our critical accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
this section also includes the impact of new accounting standards 
our business layne is a global water management  construction and drilling company 
we provide responsible solutions for water  mineral and energy challenges 
the company s operational and organizational structure is divided into divisions based on primary service lines 
each division is comprised of individual district offices  which primarily offer similar services and serve similar markets 
periodically  individual offices within a division may perform services that are normally provided by another division 
when that happens  the results of those services are recorded in the originating offices own division 
for example  if a mineral exploration division office performed water well drilling services  the revenues would be recorded in the mineral exploration division rather than the water resources division 
the company s segments are defined as follows water resources division our water resources division provides our customers with every aspect of water supply system development and technology  including hydrologic design and construction  source of supply exploration  well and intake construction and well and pump rehabilitation 
the division also brings new technologies to the water and wastewater markets and offers water treatment equipment engineering services  providing systems for the treatment of regulated and nuisance contaminants  specifically  iron  manganese  hydrogen sulfide  arsenic  radium  nitrate  perchlorate  and volatile organic compounds 
the water resources division provides water systems and services in most regions of the us inliner division our inliner division provides a wide range of process  sanitary and storm water rehabilitation solutions to municipalities and industrial customers dealing with aging infrastructure needs 
we focus on our proprietary inliner cured in place pipe cipp which allows us to rehabilitate aging sanitary sewer  storm water and process water infrastructure to provide structural rebuilding as well as infiltration and inflow reduction 
our trenchless technology minimizes environmental impact and reduces or eliminates surface and social disruption 
we are somewhat unique in that the technology itself  the liner tube manufacturer and the largest installer of the inliner cipp technology are all housed within our family of companies 
while we focus on our proprietary inliner cipp  we are committed to full system renewal 
we also provide a wide variety of other rehabilitative methods including janssen structural renewal for service lateral connections and mainlines  slip lining  traditional excavation and replacement  u liner high density polyethylene fold and form and manhole renewal with cementitious and epoxy products 
during fiscal we were able to obtain the licensing for a new technology  saertex  which uses ultra violet light technology as part of its process 
it provides the company with a uniquely different approach to process the storm and sanitary water systems of customers  the majority of which are in the us heavy civil division our heavy civil division delivers sustainable solutions to government agencies and industrial clients by overseeing the design and construction of water and wastewater treatment plants and pipeline installation 
in addition  heavy civil builds radial collector wells ranney method  surface water intakes  pumping stations  hard rock tunnels and marine construction services all in support of the world s water infrastructure 
beyond water solutions  our heavy civil division also designs and constructs biogas facilities anaerobic digesters for the purpose of generating and capturing methane gas  an emerging renewable energy resource for customers predominantly in the us geoconstruction division we provide specialized geotechnical foundation construction services to the heavy civil  industrial  commercial and private construction markets around the globe 
we have the expertise and equipment to provide the most appropriate deep foundation system  ground improvement and earth support solution to be applied given highly variable geological and site conditions 
in addition  we offer extensive experience in successful completion of complex and schedule driven major underground construction projects 
we provide services that are focused primarily on the foundation systems for dams levees  tunnel shafts  utility systems  subways or transportation systems  commercial building and port facilities 
services offered include jet grouting  structural diaphragm and slurry cutoff walls  cement and chemical grouting  drilled piles  ground improvement and earth retention systems 
the geoconstruction division provides services in most regions of the us  as well as brazil and uruguay 
mineral exploration division our mineral exploration division conducts primarily aboveground drilling activities  including all phases of core drilling  reverse circulation  dual tube  hammer and rotary air blast methods 
our service offerings include both exploratory greenfield and definition brownfield drilling 
global mining companies hire us to extract samples from their sites that they analyze for mineral content before investing heavily in development to extract the minerals 
we provide information to our clients that assists them in determining if a minable mineral deposit exists on the site  the economic viability of mining the site and the geological properties of the ground  and the determination of mine planning 
our primary markets are in the western us  mexico  australia  brazil and africa 
we also have ownership interests in foreign affiliates operating in latin america that form our primary presence in this market 
other other includes our layne energy services initiative of expanding water related services to the energy markets and any other specialty operations not included in one of the other divisions 
key fiscal year events margins in all of our water infrastructure businesses have declined this year  producing an overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue for all the businesses of as compared to a year ago 
the company s heavy civil division has been particularly hard hit by margin declines due to lower prices in the municipal bid market as well as delays and higher than expected costs 
in fiscal year  heavy civil division s revenues have decreased compared to last year 
reduced activity levels  continued costs on certain projects and excess administrative overhead cost have resulted in continuing losses for the heavy civil division 
the heavy civil division is focused on reducing headcount  completing low margin legacy projects as expeditiously as possible  and securing new business with a higher associated profit potential 
revenues in our mineral exploration division began to decline in the second half of fiscal year  and have decreased compared to last year  driven by the global mining expenditure slowdown 
we anticipate revenues and profit will continue to decline in the first half of next fiscal year 
management has taken steps to reduce overhead costs  however certain expenses such as depreciation on previously acquired assets  were not reduced 
the combination of lower activity levels and fixed overhead costs resulted in a decrease in pre tax earnings for fiscal year of 
during fy  we recorded impairment charges totaling million for certain product lines which we concluded did not fit within our overall strategic direction 
the amount included million related to intangible assets  with the remainder consisting of adjustments to record tangible assets at an expected realizable value 
charges associated with the water resources division were million  and million associated with specialty operations not included in our main operating divisions 
on may   the company acquired the remaining of diberil sociedad an nima diberil  a uruguayan company and parent company to costa fortuna brazil and uruguay for million 
diberil  with operations in sao paulo  brazil  and montevideo  uruguay  is one of the largest providers of specialty foundation and specialized marine geotechnical services in south america 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining equity interest and recording the operation on a fully consolidated basis  the company remeasured the previously held equity investment in diberil to fair value and recognized a loss of million during the second quarter 
the fair value of the noncontrolling interest was estimated to be million at the time of the adjustment 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the sale of the exploration and production assets of its energy division for million  of which million was received in the quarter 
results of the energy division were a loss on discontinued operations net of tax of million for fiscal year on december   layne s board of directors approved the relocation of the company s global corporate headquarters from mission woods  kansas  to the woodlands  a suburb of houston 
the move is expected to commence in spring and be completed by winter the move will involve most executive positions in layne s corporate leadership  as well as certain other management and staff positions 
most senior executives from layne s divisions will ultimately consolidate in the houston headquarters 
in connection with this relocation  the company expects that it will incur pre tax charges of approximately million  associated with personnel relocation  employee attrition and replacement  and office relocation and other costs 
expenses of million related to the relocation were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  with a substantial part of the remaining costs expected to be incurred in fiscal year tax and other incentives totaling approximately million are expected to be received over a ten year period from various state and local agencies

cost of revenues increased million or to million of revenues for fy  compared to million of revenues for fy margin pressures across most divisions  especially those exposed to the municipal sector  and higher than anticipated costs in our heavy civil business have increased cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fy  compared to million for fy the decrease was a combination of several changes in cost 
last year we recorded a million liability related to the investigation into the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  which has not changed 
we had decreases in costs due to reductions in short and long term incentive compensation of million and a reduction in operating taxes of million primarily due to a favorable audit settlement 
we had costs of million from newly acquired operations  and increases of million related to executive transition and other costs associated with the relocation of the corporate headquarters and million in higher legal and professional fees 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for fy  compared to million for fy the increase was primarily the result of million of depreciation and amortization of assets acquired through the purchase of diberil and increases associated with other equipment additions 
during the second quarter of fy  the company acquired the remaining interest in diberil  a company previously accounted for on the equity method basis 
in accordance with accounting guidance in moving the acquired company to a fully consolidated basis  the company remeasured the previously held equity investment to fair value and recognized a non cash loss of million during the period 
during fy we recorded impairment charges totaling million for certain product lines which we concluded did not fit within our overall strategic direction 
the amount included million related to intangible assets  with the remainder consisting of adjustments to record tangible assets at an expected realizable value 
charges of million were associated with the water resources division  and million were associated with specialty operations not included in our main operating divisions 
during the fourth quarter of fy  in connection with our annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles  we recorded impairment charges totaling million 
the charges included million associated with the water resources division  million associated with the inliner division  million associated with the heavy civil division and million associated with our other businesses 
the charges in the heavy civil division include million related to trade names  largely due to our corporate strategy decision in the fourth quarter to emphasize the layne name for the company s services worldwide  which resulted in our ceasing to use these trade names 
the remainder of the charges in the heavy civil division  and the charges in the other divisions  were to write off substantially all of the goodwill associated with those divisions 
the write offs were a result of projected continued weakness in demand for construction projects that was greater and more persistent than originally anticipated  continuing projected weakness in the economy adversely affecting spending by government agencies and the resulting pressures on margins from increased competition from smaller competitors 
the goodwill charge in water resources was also impacted by a shift in the corporate strategy in the fourth quarter to focus more on traditional water treatment services  resulting in the write off of goodwill associated with acquired companies that had a heavy research and development focus 
the tax effect of the impairment charges was a benefit of million 
equity in earnings of affiliates was million for fy  compared to million for fy the equity earnings are comprised of earnings from diberil prior to our acquisition of the remaining interest  and from our mineral exploration affiliates in south america 
due to the purchase of the remaining interest in diberil on may   the operations of diberil subsequent to the acquisition are consolidated and we are no longer recording equity in earnings for that entity 
the decrease in equity earnings from our south american affiliates was a result of similar slowdowns in exploration activity by mining clients as we experienced in our wholly owned operations 
interest expense increased to million for fy  compared to million for fy the increase was the result of increased borrowing on our revolving credit facilities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital needs 
other income  net for fy consisted primarily of a combination of gains on sales of surplus equipment of million  recognition of million of previously deferred gain on the sale of an operating facility in california  an adjustment of million for the expected earnout liability on a prior acquisition 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded for continuing operations for fy  compared to an expense for continuing operations of million for fy the company had several items impacting the tax rate for fy there was no tax benefit recorded on the previously disclosed loss associated with the equity investment in diberil 
additionally  certain of the company s tax years in the us and foreign jurisdictions were closed with no adjustments  resulting in the reversal of previously established reserves for uncertain tax positions totaling million 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for fy excluding these items was 
for fy  the effective tax rate for continuing operations was impacted by the impairment charges 
excluding the impairment charges  the company would have recorded an income tax expense of million  an adjusted effective rate of 
the difference in the adjusted effective rate as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a change in the mix of domestic and foreign income along with the favorable tax treatment of equity in earnings of affiliates which are permanently reinvested 
non gaap financial measures the company uses certain financial measures to assess performance which are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these measures are included as a complement to results provided in accordance with gaap because we believe these non gaap financial measures help us explain underlying performance trends in our business and provide useful information to both management and investors 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results 
these include the presentations of division income before certain charges and effective income tax rates excluding those charges 
operating segment review of operations water resources division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before impairments and income taxes less impairment charges income loss before income taxes water resources division revenues increased million  or  for fy compared to fy the increase in revenues was due mainly to a project beginning in ethiopia  better performance in the southeast and midwest groups due to drought related projects and revenues generated on contracts which have partially replaced revenues of million from a large project in afghanistan in the prior year 
income loss before income taxes was heavily impacted by impairments in both fy million and fy million 
income before income taxes for fy included the recognition of a deferred gain on the sale of a facility in fontana  california  of million as compared to million in fy 
apart from the impact of the impairments and deferred gain  income from the remaining activity for the division increased over a year ago due to steps being taken to control overhead costs and improve margins through diversity of the work being performed  including a water supply project being executed for a customer of our mineral exploration division in mexico 
the backlog in the water resources division was million as of january   compared to million as of january  this decrease is primarily due to what we believe is a temporary slowdown in deep injection well drilling projects in florida 
inliner division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before impairments and income taxes less impairment charges income loss before income taxes inliner division revenues increased million  or  for fy the division has experienced some shifts in the geographic regions in which we generate revenues but overall steady activity levels  as well as increased sales of lining products to third party contractors 
income loss before income taxes was heavily impacted by impairments in fy million 
aside from the impairments  income before income taxes was basically flat with last year 
the backlog in the inliner division was million as of january   compared to million as of january  heavy civil division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss before impairments and income taxes less impairment charges loss before income taxes the overall decline in revenues for the heavy civil division was primarily comprised of a decrease of million for our plant construction work in fy  reflecting our focus on pursuing higher margin opportunities 
higher than anticipated costs on legacy projects and the inability to cover administrative overhead costs with the lower activity levels have resulted in continuing losses for the division 
as previously announced  management has been replaced in several of the division s offices and the division is focused on completing low margin legacy projects as expeditiously as possible  while securing new business with a higher associated profit potential and reducing overhead 
headcount in the division is less than last year 
the backlog in the heavy civil division was million as of january   compared to million as of january  the backlog at january   includes million of remaining backlog for the previously announced project for islamorada  florida 
the majority of the backlog for islamorada is expected to proceed over the next two years  although a plant operating component could extend for multiple years 
geoconstruction division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes equity in earnings of affiliates  included in above earnings on may   the division acquired the remaining of diberil 
the results of diberil are reported on a consolidated basis from the date of acquisition  rather than on an equity basis as had been done previously 
in accordance with accounting guidance in moving diberil to a fully consolidated basis  we remeasured the previously held non controlling interest in diberil to fair value and recognized a non cash loss of million during the second quarter of fy geoconstruction division revenues increased million for fy  which reflected revenues from diberil of million no comparable amounts were recorded last year  and progress on ground stabilization projects in washington dc  florida  new york and indiana  offset by reduced revenues from a large dam stabilization project from the prior year which is winding down 
including its consolidated and equity basis results  diberil contributed million of income before income taxes for fy  compared to million for fy results at diberil have improved over last year due to good performance on a river crossing project in the amazon 
income before income taxes decreased million for fy compared to the prior year 
the decrease includes a non cash loss of million on the remeasurement of the equity investment in diberil during the second quarter 
while we have been able to replace the revenue from the dam stabilization project noted above  the margins on these new projects have been less  resulting in decreased operating results 
these decreases were partially offset by the diberil operating results as discussed above 
we are pursuing significant change orders on several projects  which have not been recognized in our estimates as they are not yet approved 
if we are successful in obtaining approval  they will have a favorable impact in the period in which they are recognized 
the backlog in the geoconstruction division was million as of january   compared to million as of january  mineral exploration division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes equity in earnings of affiliates  included in above earnings mineral exploration division revenues decreased million  or  for fy as compared to last year 
the decline in revenues was primarily in africa million  canada million  and australia million  offset partially by an increase of million in revenues in mexico 
the declines in africa and australia reflect recent cut backs on exploration programs by our customers as they adjust to world economic changes and  in some cases  work through the integration of large acquisitions 
the decline in canada is due to shifting most of our equipment in canada to opportunities with better profit potential in mexico and brazil 
income before income taxes decreased million  or  for fy as compared to last year 
the division had improved earnings in some locations  and favorable reductions in legal expenses  however was not able to offset the impact of the overall decreases in revenues noted above 
management has taken steps to react to the lower revenue levels  however  certain overhead expenses and depreciation on previously acquired assets could not be reduced in the short term 
the combination of the lower activity levels and fixed overhead costs produced the earnings decline during the year 
equity in earnings from our affiliates in south america was also impacted during fy by slowdowns in mineral exploration activity  as well as by a temporary mine shutdown by one of our clients earlier in the year 
other fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss before impairments and income taxes less impairment charges loss before income taxes other revenues and losses before income taxes are primarily from our layne energy services initiative of expanding water related services to the energy markets 
the increased loss before income taxes in fy is due to impairment charges of million taken related to non core product lines and severance costs to replace certain senior executives 
unallocated corporate expenses corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions  primarily included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were million for fy  compared to million for fy the increase is primarily due to million related to executive transition and other costs associated with the relocation of the corporate headquarters and million in higher legal and professional fees  offset by million reductions in short and long term incentive compensation 
comparison of fiscal year fy to fiscal year fy revenues increased million or to  million for fy  compared to million for fy strong activity levels were displayed across all mineral exploration division locations with the largest increases in africa  the western us and mexico 
a further discussion of results of operations by division is presented below 
cost of revenues increased million or to million of revenues for fy  compared to million of revenues for fy the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to cost overruns and project delays in our heavy civil business in the second half of the year and margin pressures in our heavy civil and water resources businesses due to the continuing weakness in municipal spending 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fy  compared to million for fy in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million liability related to the investigation into the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
the remaining increase was primarily due to additional expenses of million from acquired operations  million in increased compensation costs  costs of million associated with the transition of the chief executive officer and other executives  million in increased legal and professional fees and million in increased travel expenses 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in consulting services of million due to higher costs in fy associated with systems implementation and merger and acquisition projects 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for fy  compared to million for fy the increase was primarily the result of increases in assets from acquisitions and property additions 
during the fourth quarter of fy  in connection with our annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles  we recorded impairment charges totaling million 
the charges included million associated with the water resources division  million associated with the inliner division  million associated with the heavy civil division and million associated with our other businesses 
the charges in the heavy civil division include million related to trade names  largely due our corporate strategy decision in the fourth quarter to emphasize the layne name for the company s services worldwide  which will result in our ceasing to use these trade names 
the remainder of the charges in the heavy civil division  and the charges in the other divisions  are to write off substantially all of the goodwill associated with those divisions 
the write offs are a result of projected continued weakness in demand for construction projects that is greater and more persistent than originally anticipated  continuing projected weakness in the economy adversely affecting spending by government agencies and the resulting pressures on margins from increased competition from smaller competitors 
the goodwill charge in water resources was also impacted by a shift in the corporate strategy in the fourth quarter to focus more on traditional water treatment services  resulting in the write off of goodwill associated with acquired companies that had a heavy research and development focus 
the tax effect of the impairment charges was a benefit of million 
equity in earnings of affiliates was million for fy  compared to million for fy the increase reflects the impact of an improved minerals exploration market in latin america  primarily for gold and copper in chile and peru as well as a full year of operations from our geoconstruction affiliate in brazil 
interest expense increased to million for fy  compared to million for fy the increase was the result of increased borrowing on our revolving credit facilities to fund operations 
other income  net for fy consisted primarily of a gain of million inclusive of million amortization of deferred gain on the sale of a facility in california  a gain of million on the sale of certain investment securities in australia and gains of million on the sale of other equipment 
the company recorded income tax expense of million on a loss before income taxes of million  resulting in an effective rate of negative for fy  compared to expense of million an effective rate of for fy excluding the impact of the impairment charges  for fy  the company would have recorded income tax expense of million an adjusted effective rate of 
the adjusted effective rate for the current year was lower than the effective rate for the prior year due to the continued increase in the equity earnings of affiliates as a percentage of income before income taxes 
as a substantial part of the non dividend portion of these earnings is considered indefinitely re invested  it tends to lower our effective tax rate 
operating segment review of operations water resources division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before impairments and income taxes less impairment charges loss income before income taxes at our water resources division  revenue levels were up across all product lines  particularly water supply  repair and installation services and our deep wastewater injection well work for power companies in the florida market 
the increases were partially offset by a decline of million from our water supply project in afghanistan which was substantially completed early in the year 
income before impairments and income taxes included a gain of million including million amortization of deferred gain on the sale of a facility in fontana  california 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline of million from our afghanistan project which has not been fully replaced  lower margins on municipal bid work and by losses in our water treatment operations 
we expect profit margins for projects in the municipal sector to remain under pressure for at least the next year 
the backlog in the water resources division was million as of january   compared to million as of january  inliner division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before impairments and income taxes less impairment charges loss income before income taxes inliner division revenues increased primarily due to the impact of acquired operations  which contributed revenues of million 
the increase in income before impairments and income taxes was largely due to improved margins  particularly in the southeast us the acquired operations are being transitioned into the division and were not large contributors to earnings 
the backlog in the inliner division was million as of january   compared to million as of january  heavy civil division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss income before impairments and income taxes less impairment charges loss income before income taxes the decreases in heavy civil division revenues were due to slight revenue declines across most of our operations as the division encountered greater competition 
our expansion into the southwestern us continued  contributing revenues of million 
the decline in income before impairments and income taxes reflect the impact of extensive project delays and cost overruns  as well as margin pressures on municipal bid projects 
we have made operational and overhead changes to curtail the losses  including terminating certain project managers  reducing administrative staff and changing our bidding practices  but we expect low margins and bidding pressures to continue to hold earnings to near breakeven for calendar the backlog in the heavy civil division was million as of january   compared to million as of january  the decline is partially due to our efforts to increase our bid margins and reduce the levels of low margin projects 
geoconstruction division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes equity in earnings of affiliates  included in above earnings revenues include a full year of operations for bencor  acquired at the end of the third quarter of fy revenue in our other operations was down  due in large part to time spent reallocating our resources following the completion of large projects in new orleans and san francisco 
income before income taxes was primarily attributable to an increase of million from acquired operations and to million increased equity earnings from our affiliates 
the backlog in the geoconstruction division was million as of january   compared to million as of january  mineral exploration division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes equity in earnings of affiliates  included in above earnings mineral exploration revenues increased due to high activity levels across all locations  and were particularly strong in mexico  southern africa and the southwest us the increase in income before income taxes resulted primarily from a combination of high activity levels and continued improvement in pricing in substantially all of our operations  as well as equity earnings from our affiliates in latin america 
although they slowed in the fourth quarter due to project start up expenses and other delays at certain mine site locations  our partners had their strongest year ever  with significant increases at copper mine sites in chile 
the increases were partially offset by increased legal and professional expenses related to the fcpa investigation of million  and by the accrual of million for the fcpa investigation in the fourth quarter 
other fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss before impairments and income taxes less impairment charges loss before income taxes other revenues increased primarily as a result of increased revenues of million from our energy services operations 
the increase in loss before impairments and income taxes resulted primarily from acquisition integration related costs 
unallocated corporate expenses corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions  primarily included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were million for fy  compared to million for fy current year expenses include million related to the transition of the chief executive officer and other executives 
the remaining decrease from last year includes reductions of million in consulting costs for systems implementation and merger and acquisition projects  and million in incentive compensation expenses 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large  long term contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited or no damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling and construction activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to project sites  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year 
see the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
inflation management does not believe that the company s operations for the periods discussed have been significantly adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of its reportable segments 
this includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity  to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding capital expenditures 
the company s primary source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its credit facilities 
the company s working capital as of january  and was million and million  respectively 
the company s cash and cash equivalents as of january  were million  compared to million as of january  the company believes that it will have sufficient cash from operations and access to credit facilities to meet its operating cash requirements  make required debt payments  and fund its capital expenditures 
funding for potential acquisitions will be evaluated based on the particular facts and circumstances of the opportunity 
of our cash and cash equivalents  amounts held by foreign subsidiaries as of january  were million  compared to million as of january  repatriation of cash balances from some of the company foreign subsidiaries could result in withholding taxes in the local jurisdictions 
restrictions on the transfer of foreign cash and cash equivalents have not significantly impacted the company s overall liquidity 
we continue to monitor developments in the foreign countries in which we operate for changes in currency regulation 
in that regard  certain countries in africa will begin to require companies to transact in local currency rather than the us dollar 
we are assessing any necessary changes in our operations in response to these changes  but do not believe the new requirements will significantly impact our liquidity 
subsequent to year end  the company was notified that one of its banks had restricted access to all funds over a certain dollar amount and has also received information that the bank may be ceasing operations 
the company is in the process of engaging local legal counsel to assist in recovering its funds 
at this time the company is not able to estimate the amount of funds  if any  which it will be unable to recover 
at the time of closure  the company held million in the closed facility 
see note the company maintains an unsecured million revolving credit facility the credit agreement which extends to march   as well as a private shelf agreement the shelf agreement whereby it can issue million in unsecured notes 
the shelf agreement extends to july  no unsecured notes have been issued under the shelf agreement as of january  on january   there were letters of credit of million and borrowings of million outstanding under the credit agreement resulting in available capacity of million 
the company s shelf agreement and credit agreement each contain certain covenants including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens  investments  acquisitions  transfer or sale of assets  transactions with affiliates and payment of dividends 
these provisions generally allow such activity to occur  subject to specific limitations and continued compliance with financial maintenance covenants 
significant financial maintenance covenants are a fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
covenant levels and definitions are generally consistent between the two agreements 
the financial covenants are based on defined terms included in the agreements  such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar 
compliance with the financial covenants is required on a quarterly basis  using the most recent four fiscal quarters 
adjusted ebitda is generally defined as consolidated net income excluding discontinued operations  net interest expense  provision for income taxes  gains or losses from extraordinary items  gains or losses from the sale of capital assets  non cash items including depreciation and amortization  and share based compensation 
equity in earnings of affiliates is included only to the extent of dividends or distributions received 
adjusted ebitdar is defined as adjusted editda  plus rent expense 
all of these measures are considered non gaap financial measures and are not intended to be in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant is the ratio of adjusted ebitdar to the sum of fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of rent expense  interest expense  and principal payments of long term debt 
the company s leverage ratio covenant is the ratio of total funded indebtedness to adjusted ebitda 
total funded indebtedness generally consists of outstanding debt  capital leases  asset retirement obligations and escrow liabilities 
as of january  and  the company s actual and required covenant levels under the existing agreements were as follows actual required actual required minimum fixed charge coverage ratio maximum leverage ratio the company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants as of january  however  if the recent weakness in our markets and our operations continues  we may not be in compliance with our ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda in future periods 
we believe we have alternative actions within our control which could be taken to enhance our ability to remain in compliance 
if we were to fail to continue to meet our ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda or any of our other loan covenants in the future  we would pursue bank waivers of compliance and amend our revolving credit facility to allow us to become compliant 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the primary drivers for our cash from operating activities are our results of operations and our management of working capital levels 
working capital  excluding debt  was million at january   and million at january  working capital decreased during fy  particularly in the fourth quarter  as our revenue levels have declined and due to collection efforts 
the declines were offset to an extent by inventory levels which increased  primarily due to large material purchases for two projects 
investing activities the company s capital expenditures of million for fy were split between million to maintain and upgrade its equipment and facilities and million spent on the company s unconventional natural gas exploration and production prior to its sale in the third quarter 
this compares to equipment spending of million and natural gas exploration and production spending of million for fy the spending in fy included million to purchase and prepare a new facility in california 
the company s remaining capital expenditures for continuing operations in fy and fy were primarily spent on maintaining and upgrading our equipment and facilities 
for fy  the company received million in proceeds from disposals of property and equipment  compared to proceeds of million for fy fy included proceeds of million from the sale of a facility in california 
during fy  the company invested million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of the remaining of diberil  as well as invested million to acquire of the stock of fursol informatica srl fursol 
an additional million will be paid for fursol on october  pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement 
this compares to acquisition related spending of million for fy the company intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities to enhance its existing service offerings and to expand our geographic market 
financing activities during fy  fy and fy  the company had net borrowings of million  million and million under its credit facilities 
borrowings were primarily used to fund the company s capital expenditures  acquisitions  and working capital needs 
the company made scheduled debt payments on its senior notes of million in fy and million in fy during fy and fy  the company distributed million and million to its non controlling interest partners as either distributions of joint project income or  in the case of a mineral exploration subsidiary in brazil  to buy out the non controlling interest 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january   are summarized as follows payments expiration by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations and other commercial commitments credit agreement notes payable operating leases capitalized leases including interest supplemental retirement benefits software financing obligations income tax uncertainties total contractual obligations standby letters of credit total contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company expects to meet its cash contractual obligations in the ordinary course of operations  and that the standby letters of credit will be renewed in connection with its annual insurance renewal process 
interest is payable on the credit agreement at variable interest rates equal to  at the company s option  a libor rate plus to  or a base rate  as defined in the credit agreement plus up to  each depending on the company s leverage ratio 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements interest payments on the credit agreement are uncertain due to variable interest rates and fluctuations in the outstanding balance  and accordingly have not been included in the table above 
the company has income tax uncertainties in the amount of million at january   that are classified as non current on the company s balance sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year 
the ultimate timing of resolution of these items is uncertain  and accordingly the amounts have not been included in the table above 
the company incurs additional obligations in the ordinary course of operations 
these obligations  including but not limited to income tax payments  are expected to be met in the normal course of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  located in item of this form k 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although not all inclusive 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized on large  long term construction contracts meeting the criteria of accounting standards codification asc topic construction type and production type contracts asc topic  using the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
the nature of accounting for contracts is such that refinements of the estimating process for changing conditions and new developments are continuous and characteristic of the process 
many factors can and do change during a contract performance period which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability of skilled contract labor  the performance of major material suppliers  the performance of major subcontractors  unusual weather conditions and unexpected changes in material costs 
these factors may result in revision to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
because the company has many contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other minimizing the impact on overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex construction projects can have a material impact on the company s financial statements and are reflected in results of operations when they become known 
these changes should be appropriate  timely and adequately supported 
these changes include changes in expected cost of materials  labor  productivity  weather  changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  change orders and final contract settlements  and other factors  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
as allowed by asc topic  revenue is recognized on smaller  short term construction contracts using the completed contract method 
contracts for the company s mineral exploration drilling services are billable based on the quantity of drilling performed 
thus  revenues for these drilling contracts are recognized on the basis of actual footage or meterage drilled 
revenues for direct sales of equipment and other ancillary products not provided in conjunction with the performance of construction contracts are recognized at the date of delivery to  and acceptance by  the customer 
provisions for estimated warranty obligations are made in the period in which the sales occur 
revenues for the sale of oil and gas by the company s discontinued energy division were recognized on the basis of volumes sold at the time of delivery to an end user or an interstate pipeline  net of amounts attributable to royalty or working interest holders 
the company s revenues are presented net of taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions with its customers  such as  but not limited to  sales  use  value added and some excise taxes 
goodwill the company s impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation for impairment is conducted at the reporting unit level 
the company s reporting units are the same as its operating segments 
the evaluation is performed by using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
we consider both a market approach and an income approach in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit in our analysis 
the market approach may include use of the guideline transaction method  the guideline company method  or both 
the guideline transaction method makes use of available transaction price data of companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the respective reporting unit 
the guideline company method uses market multiples of publically traded companies with operating characteristics similar to the respective reporting unit 
the income approach uses projections of each reporting unit s estimated cash flows discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
we also compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization plus a control premium 
the more significant assumptions used in the income approach  which are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions  are as follows anticipated future cash flows and long term growth rates for each reporting unit 
the income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows  including an estimate of long term growth rates 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of expected changes in operating margins 
the company s projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
actual results could vary significantly from estimates 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is subject to changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in our industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate could change 
a change in events or circumstances  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive or economic environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
if additional goodwill or other intangibles on the consolidated balance sheet become impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of january   the book value of the company s intangible assets  net of amortization  was million and goodwill totaled million 
of the goodwill amount  million is recorded within the geoconstruction reporting unit and million is recorded within the inliner reporting unit 
as of our annual valuation date  the fair value of the geoconstruction and inliner reporting units exceed their carrying value by and  respectively 
a decrease in the fair value of these reporting units  holding all other variables constant  could result in incremental goodwill impairment 
as of our valuation date  an increase in the discount rates used in the income approach for geoconstruction from the rate used to  and for inliner from to  would reduce the estimated fair value under the income approach to equal the carrying value 
other long lived assets long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets and the company s gas transportation facilities and equipment  are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance of our assets  significant changes in the use of the assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
accrued insurance expense the company maintains insurance programs where it is responsible for a certain amount of each claim up to a retention limit 
estimates are recorded for health and welfare  property and casualty insurance costs that are associated with these programs 
these costs are estimated based on actuarially determined projections of future payments under these programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs could be required 
costs estimated to be incurred in the future for employee health and welfare benefits  property  workers compensation and casualty insurance programs resulting from claims which have occurred are accrued currently 
under the terms of the company s agreement with the various insurance carriers administering these claims  the company is not required to remit the total premium until the claims are actually paid by the insurance companies 
these costs are not expected to significantly impact liquidity in future periods 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset liability method  in which deferred taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
the company reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability on a jurisdictional basis 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets 
the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified 
accounting guidance states that a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets 
as such  it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses 
in preparing future taxable income projections  the company considers the periods in which future reversals of existing taxable and deductible temporary differences are likely to occur  future taxable income  taxable income available in prior carry back years  and the availability of tax planning strategies when determining the realizability of recorded deferred tax assets 
provision for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is made only on those amounts in excess of funds considered to be invested indefinitely 
the company s estimate of uncertainty in income taxes is based on the framework established in the accounting for income taxes guidance 
this guidance addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
for tax positions that meet this recognition threshold  the company applies judgment  taking into account applicable tax laws and experience in managing tax audits and relevant accounting guidance  to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize in the financial statements 
for each uncertain position  the difference between the benefit realized on our tax return and the benefit reflected in the financial statements is recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
this liability is updated at each financial statement date to reflect the impacts of audit settlements and other resolution of audit issues  expiration of statutes of limitation  developments in tax law and ongoing discussions with taxing authorities 
litigation and other contingencies the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these proceedings 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and other information and events pertaining to a particular case 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change 
new accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk on variable rate debt  foreign exchange rate risk that could give rise to translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rate risk the company centrally manages its debt portfolio considering overall financing strategies and tax consequences 
a description of the company s debt is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
as of january  an instantaneous change in interest rates of one percentage point would impact the company s annual interest expense by approximately million 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets involves exposure to possible volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
currently  the company s primary international operations are in australia  africa  mexico  canada  brazil and italy 
the operations are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s affiliates also operate in south america and mexico see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the company s contracts in africa and mexico are us dollar based  providing a natural reduction in exposure to currency fluctuations 
the company may also utilize various hedge instruments  primarily foreign currency option contracts  to manage the exposures associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates 
as of january   the company did not have any outstanding foreign currency option contracts 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international operations into us dollars may affect year to year comparability of operating results 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact income before income taxes by approximately million  million and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
this represents approximately of the income before income taxes of international businesses after adjusting for primarily us dollar based operations 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations  as it does not take into account any governmental actions  changes in customer purchasing patterns or changes in the company s financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses in the company s consolidated results of operations reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses from the company s mexican and african operations which use the us dollar as their functional currency 
net foreign exchange losses for the years ended january   and  were million  million and million  respectively
