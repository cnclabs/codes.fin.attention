overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatments for diabetes that may be safer  more effective and more convenient for patients 
we develop our product candidates by applying our proprietary formulation technologies to existing drugs in order to improve their therapeutic profiles 
our proprietary insulin formulations are designed to be more rapid acting than the formulations currently available to type and type diabetes patients 
we refer to these as ultra rapid acting formulations 
our glucagon formulations and presentations are designed to be stable at room temperature and are intended for use by caregivers with no medical training as a rescue treatment for diabetes patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia  or very low concentrations of blood glucose 
our most advanced ultra rapid acting insulin formulation  biod  combines recombinant human insulin  or rhi  with our proprietary combination of excipients to increase the rate of absorption following injection when compared to other commercially available insulin formulations  including rapid acting mealtime insulin analogs such as humalog  marketed by eli lilly  novolog  marketed by novo nordisk and apidra  marketed by sanofi aventis 
we are also using our proprietary excipients to develop ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations using either insulin lispro  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in humalog  or insulin aspart  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in novolog 
an earlier rhi based formulation known as linjeta and previously referred to as viaject was the subject of a new drug application  or nda  that we submitted to the fda in december in october  the fda issued a complete response letter stating that the nda for linjeta could not be approved in its submitted form and that we should conduct two new phase clinical trials using our preferred commercial formulation of linjeta prior to re submitting the nda 
based upon the complete response letter and subsequent feedback that the fda provided  we decided to develop newer rhi based formulations with the goal of identifying a formulation with a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile similar to linjeta  but with improved injection site toleration characteristics 
from january to april  we studied several such newer formulations  including biod  in phase clinical trials 
in these trials  we used humalog as the comparator drug rather than the comparator drug we used in our phase linjeta clinical trials 
in our phase clinical trials  the comparator drug was humulin r  an rhi based insulin formulation marketed by eli lilly that is less rapid acting than the insulin analog humalog 
biod achieved our target pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic and injection site toleration profiles for a candidate rhi based formulation in a phase clinical trial completed in april  and in the third calendar quarter of we began enrolling patients in a phase clinical trial of biod the phase clinical trial of biod was a randomized  open label  parallel group study conducted at investigative centers in the united states 
in the trial  patients with type diabetes were randomized to receive either biod or humalog to use as their mealtime insulin during an week treatment period 
both arms of the study used insulin glargine  sold as lantus  as the basal insulin 
the clinical trial was designed to evaluate hbac control as the primary endpoint  and secondary endpoints included postprandial glucose excursions  glycemic variability  hypoglycemic event rates and weight changes 
the phase clinical trial of biod completed patient dosing in the second calendar quarter of  and in september we announced preliminary results from the trial 
biod achieved the primary endpoint of noninferiority for hbac relative to humalog 
the mean hbac change from baseline in the biod group was and in the humalog group 
the confidence interval  of the between group differences in change from baseline hbac did not exceed the fda designated threshold of  thereby establishing non inferiority 
we expect to provide an update on our further development plans for biod after completing our analysis of the data from the phase clinical trial and following discussions with fda on clinical trial design  safety and chemistry  manufacturing and controls relating to potential future studies 
in addition to biod  we have other rhi based formulations in earlier stages of development 
in particular  we are developing ultra rapid acting formulations of concentrated insulin that are characterized by a rapid onset of action and a prolonged duration of action 
we believe these formulations could address an unmet medical need for an insulin with an initial rate of absorption superior to that of existing concentrated insulins and prandial basal pre mixed insulins 
in november  we announced that we had initiated a phase clinical trial with biod  our lead candidate for an ultra rapid acting concentrated insulin formulation 
biod contains units of rhi per milliliter instead of the standard units per milliliter  and is formulated with edta  citrate and magnesium sulfate 
in preclinical studies in diabetic swine  biod demonstrated a more rapid rate of absorption and onset of action  along with a similar duration of action  when compared to humulin r u  a presentation containing units of rhi per millimeter 
in other preclinical studies  biod also demonstrated a more rapid rate of absorption and onset of action when compared to humalog pre mixed prandial basal formulations 
in the phase clinical trial of biod  we will evaluate and compare the onset and duration of action and injection site tolerability of biod to humulin r u and to humalog prandial basal pre mixed insulin 
we anticipate reporting top line data from the clinical trial in the first calendar quarter of we also continue to develop ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations 
in january  we announced top line results from our phase clinical trial of two insulin analog based formulations  biod and biod these formulations  which were manufactured using commercial preparations of humalog  generally use the same or similar excipients as biod and were intended to be optimized for rapid absorption and injection site toleration 
the trial  which was conducted in australia  was designed to compare the pharmacokinetic and injection site toleration profiles of biod and biod relative to humalog 
in the trial  both formulations met our target pharmacokinetic profile for an ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulation  and biod met our target injection site toleration profile 
we do not expect to study these formulations in additional clinical trials because they were formulated by adding our proprietary excipients to the marketed formulation of humalog and because they do not demonstrate stability characteristics consistent with our target product profile 
accordingly  we are continuing our insulin analog based formulation work to develop formulations using insulin lispro as the active pharmaceutical ingredient  rather than a marketed presentation of humalog 
in addition to our ultra rapid acting insulin formulation program  we are developing room temperature stable glucagon presentations for use as a rescue treatment for diabetes patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia 
in june  we announced plans to develop a novel glucagon rescue product to treat severe hypoglycemia using a proprietary device from unilife corporation 
the device  which is being customized for use in emergency situations by patient caregivers with no medical training  is a dual chamber design that automatically reconstitutes lyophilized glucagon with a liquid diluent immediately prior to injection  and it features automatic needle retraction on full dose delivery 
we expect to submit an investigational new drug application to the fda for our dual chamber glucagon rescue product during the next nine months and anticipate conducting a pivotal clinical trial in the second half of we are also conducting preclinical testing to develop liquid formulations of glucagon for hypoglycemic rescue and other indications 
we are a development stage company 
we were incorporated in december and commenced active operations in january to date  we have generated no revenues and have incurred significant losses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses as we continue our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we have financed our operations and internal growth through various financing transactions  including our initial public offering in may and several subsequent transactions  including  most recently  our june public offering 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
our net loss was million for the year ended september  as of september   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
research and development and general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net loss applicable to common stockholders  represent approximately and  respectively  of the expenses that we have incurred since our inception 
as of september   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million in cash and cash equivalents as of september  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least until the second calendar quarter of we believe that future cash expenditures will be partially offset by raising additional capital from research grants  capital markets  proceeds derived from collaborations  including  but not limited to  upfront fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties 
we can give no assurances that such funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
we may be required to secure alternative financing arrangements or defer or limit some or all of our research  development or clinical projects 
financial operations overview revenues to date  we have generated no revenues 
we do not expect to begin generating any revenues unless any of our product candidates receive marketing approval  or if we receive payments in connection with strategic collaborations that we may enter into for the commercialization of our product candidates 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our basic research activities  as well as the costs associated with our drug development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
our research and development expenses consist of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  third party manufacturing organizations and consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits for the personnel involved in our preclinical and clinical drug development and manufacturing activities  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
we intend to focus our research and development efforts on conducting preclinical studies and phase and phase clinical trials to determine our preferred development  clinical and regulatory program for our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations and our stable glucagon presentations 
we also expect to conduct a pivotal clinical trial in support of an nda for our dual chamber glucagon rescue product candidate 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ending september  will increase as compared to the fiscal year ended september   as we continue to conduct the development work necessary to finalize the formulation and design of our dual chamber glucagon rescue product candidate  as well as the preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing activities necessary to support the filing of an nda to the fda for that product candidate  conduct additional formulation development work to improve the stability  pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic properties of our ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations  our concentrated insulin formulations and our liquid glucagon formulations  or purchase rights related to proprietary technologies that are compatible with our product candidates  purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients and other materials to support our research and development activities 
over the longer term  we anticipate that these expenses will increase further as we conduct later stage clinical trials of our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations and our dual chamber glucagon rescue product  including one or more pivotal clinical trials required for fda approval of ndas for these product candidates  and prepare and file an nda for our dual chamber glucagon rescue product candidate 
we have used our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects and our drug development programs for our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations  including biod  biod and biod  our concentrated insulin formulations and our stable glucagon presentations 
substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date are attributable to our ultra rapid acting insulin program 
in july and september  we were awarded two national institutes of health grants for the development of a concentrated ultra rapid acting insulin formulation and a stable glucagon formulation  respectively  for use in an artificial pancreas 
the july award is intended to fund research to develop a proprietary ultra rapid insulin product candidate at high concentrations suited to provide sufficient quantities of insulin in an external artificial pancreas pump device that has limited volume capacity 
the july award is for two years and totals thousand 
the september award is intended to fund research to develop a proprietary glucagon product candidate optimized to algorithmically deliver glucagon as part of a bi hormonal closed loop system to mitigate hypoglycemic events 
the september award is for two years and totals thousand 
the following table illustrates  for each period presented  our research and development costs by nature of the cost 
year ended september  december  inception to september  in thousands research and development expenses preclinical expenses    manufacturing expenses   clinical regulatory expenses   total    the following table illustrates  for each period presented  our research and development costs by project 
the year ended september  and inception to date are not noted because we did not track expenses by project in prior years  and therefore cannot accurately reflect past expense history by project 
year ended september  ultra rapid acting insulin formulations rhi based   insulin analog based   stable glucagon   concentrated rhi based formulations other   total   the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the progress  timing or success of our research and development and clinical programs for our product candidates  the degree to which our ongoing assessment of the data from our recently completed phase clinical trial of biod  our lead candidate for an ultra rapid acting insulin formulation  and our related chemistry  manufacturing and controls development work  support further clinical development by us or our potential partners  our ability to successfully use the data from our phase clinical trial of biod to design and conduct the pivotal clinical trials required by the fda to secure approval to commercialize that candidate  the success of our formulation development work to improve the stability of our newer ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations while maintaining the pharmacokinetic and injection site toleration characteristics associated with earlier formulations  our ability to conduct the development work necessary to finalize the formulation and design of our dual chamber glucagon rescue product candidate  as well as the preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing activities necessary to support the filing of an nda to the fda for that product candidate  the results of our real time stability programs for our rhi  insulin analog and glucagon based product candidates  including the reproducibility of earlier  smaller scale  stability studies and our ability to accurately project long term stability on the basis of accelerated testing  our ability to accurately anticipate technical challenges that we may face in the development of our ultra rapid acting rhi and insulin analog based product candidates or our glucagon rescue product candidates  our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the ffdca  our ability to enter into collaboration arrangements for the commercialization of our product candidates and the success or failure of any such collaborations into which we enter  or our ability to commercialize our product candidates ourselves  our ability to enforce our patents for our product candidates and our ability to secure additional patents for our product candidates  our ability to protect our intellectual property and operate our business without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  the degree of clinical utility of our product candidates  particularly with regard to our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations  which have not yet been shown to be clinically superior to existing rapid acting insulin analogs  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  such as advancements in glucagon stabilization technologies that could enable a room temperature rescue product in a portable  easy to use presentation  the ability of our contract manufacturing organizations or collaborators to produce our products in our final dosage form  our ability to secure adequate supplies of active pharmaceutical ingredients to support our product development programs and  if successful  the commercialization one or more product candidates  our capabilities and strategies for manufacturing  marketing and commercializing a product candidate  and our ability to accurately estimate anticipated operating losses  future revenues  capital requirements and our needs for additional financing 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of ultra rapid acting insulin formulations or our liquid glucagon formulation  could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with product development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  relating to our internal executive  legal  accounting  finance and information technology departments 
other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense  patent expenses  travel expenses  costs associated with industry conventions and professional fees  such as legal and accounting fees and consulting costs 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ending september  will remain substantially the same as in the fiscal year ended september  as we continue to focus our efforts on product formulation activities and begin advancing our product candidates into later stage clinical trials  including phase pivotal trials 
over the longer term  however  these expenses could increase as we prepare to file an nda in support of our dual chamber glucagon rescue product candidate and  possibly  commence pre commercialization activities 
warrant liability in june  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with our june private placement 
these warrants will expire on june   five years from the original issuance date of june  in may  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with our may registered direct offering 
these warrants will expire on may   five years from the original issuance date of may  under the terms of both the warrants and the warrants  if we enter into a merger or change of control transaction  the holders of the warrants will be entitled to receive consideration as if they had exercised the warrants immediately prior to such transaction  or they may require us to purchase the unexercised warrants at the black scholes value as defined in the applicable warrant of the warrant on the date of such transaction 
the holders have up to days following any such transaction to exercise this right 
as a result of this provision  we recognize the and warrants as liabilities at their fair value on each reporting date 
we use the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the warrants 
the black scholes valuation model takes into account  as of the valuation date  factors including the current exercise price  the expected life of the warrant  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  expected dividends on the stock  and the risk free interest rate for the term of the warrant 
using this model  we recorded an initial warrant liability of million for the warrants and million for the warrants  in each case as of the initial warrant issuance date 
the significant assumptions for the model used for the warrants were remaining terms of the warrants  the common stock price of per share  the warrant exercise price of per share  a risk free interest rate of and an expected volatility rate of 
the significant assumptions for the model used for the warrants were remaining terms of the warrants  the common stock price of per share  the warrant exercise price of per share  a risk free interest rate of and an expected volatility rate of 
the liability for both the and warrants is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized currently in the statements of operations under the caption adjustment to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
in august  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in connection with our august registered direct offering 
on december   the unexercised warrants to purchase  shares of common stock expired 
we revalued the liability from september  through the date of expiration and there was no impact on the statement of operations 
the common stock warrant liability associated with these warrants no longer exists 
interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in november  our board of directors approved investment policy guidelines  the primary objectives of which are the preservation of capital  the maintenance of liquidity and maintenance of appropriate fiduciary control  subject to our business objectives and tax situation 
we have maintained an investment strategy of investing primarily in a premier commercial money market account  which consists primarily of short term debt securities issued by the us government  treasury securities and us government agencies 
we intend to maintain this conservative strategy in fiscal year ending september  critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies  which we have discussed with our audit committee  are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals in preparing our financial statements  we must estimate accrued expenses pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions  clinical research organizations and contract manufacturers that conduct and manage preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacture product for these trials on our behalf 
this process involves communicating with relevant personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for services when we have not yet been invoiced for or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
the financial terms of these agreements vary and may result in uneven payment flows 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimates at any balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
government grants grants received are recognized as grant income when the grants become receivable  provided there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the conditions attached to the grant and there is reasonable assurance the grant will be received 
we request cash funding under approved grants as expenses are incurred not in advance and report these receipts on the statement of operations as a separate line item entitled government grants 
the corresponding expenses are included in research and development expenses 
in july and september  we were awarded two national institutes of health grants for the development of concentrated ultra rapid acting insulin formulations and liquid glucagon formulations  respectively  for use in an artificial pancreas 
both awards are for two years and total approximately thousand each 
work on the grant for the development of concentrated ultra rapid acting insulin formulation started in august and expenses incurred were thousand during the twelve months ended september  work on the grant for the development of novel and stable glucagon formulations for closed loop systems started in january  and expenses incurred were thousand during the twelve months ended september  corresponding income and receivables were recorded 
reclassifications certain items in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation 
share based compensation stock incentive plan in march  the shareholders approved the amended and restated stock incentive plan the plan 
up to  shares of common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the plan  plus  shares of common stock underlying already outstanding awards under the company prior plans 
as of september   we had  shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards 
the contractual life of options granted under the plan may not exceed seven years 
the plan uses a fungible share concept under which any awards that are not a full value award will be counted against the share limit as one share for each share of common stock and any award that is a full value award will be counted against the share limit as shares for each one share of common stock 
we have not made any new awards under any prior equity plans after march   the effective date the plan was approved by the stockholders 
the plan replaces the stock incentive plan and non employee directors stock option plan 
we use the black scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options 
the expected life for these grants was calculated in accordance with the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab topic d in accordance with sab no 
we recognize compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  in the financial statements based on fair value 
the fair value of the stock underlying the options is a significant factor in determining credits or charges to operations appropriate for the share based payments to both employees and non employees 
we base our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of our stock 
the risk free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the yield of a us treasury strip on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award 
we estimate forfeitures based on actual forfeitures during our limited history 
additionally  we have assumed that dividends will not be paid 
for options granted to non employees and non directors  primarily consultants who served on our scientific advisory board  we measure fair value of the equity instruments utilizing the black scholes valuation model  if that value is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration or service received 
the fair value of these equity investments were periodically revalued as the options were vesting and were recognized as expense over the related period of service or the vesting period  whichever was longer 
we have not granted options to non employees and non directors since the year ending september  prior to september   we issued to these non employees options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
all of these options are currently vested 
for the years ended september   and  the share based compensation expense income related to these options was million   and  respectively 
we grant restricted stock units  or rsus  to executive officers and employees pursuant to the plan  from time to time 
each rsu represents one share of common stock 
there is no direct cost to the recipients of rsus  except for any applicable taxes 
except as set forth below with regard to rsus awarded to employees in place of discretionary cash bonuses  each award vests in installments on each anniversary of the date of grant  and the costs of the awards are determined as the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant 
in all cases  costs are expensed per the vesting schedule outlined in the award 
for example  rsus awarded in december vest annually over three years  with vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant and the remainder vesting in two equal installments on each anniversary thereafter  and therefore are expensed in the first year and each year in the next two years 
except as set forth below with regard to rsus awarded to employees in place of discretionary cash bonuses  each year following the annual vesting date  between january st and march th  we will issue common stock for each vested rsu 
during the period when the rsu is vested but not distributed  the rsus cannot be transferred and the grantee has no voting rights 
if we declare a dividend  rsu recipients will receive payment based upon the percentage of rsus that have vested prior to the date of declaration 
in march  we granted rsus to our employees in place of the discretionary cash bonuses that were established in connection with the fiscal year ended september  the cost of these awards was determined to be the value of the discretionary cash bonuses 
these rsus vested  and the underlying shares were distributed  on september  at that time  the value of the discretionary cash bonuses exceeded the fair market value of the corresponding rsus 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense  including expenses associated with stock options and rsus  was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense  including expenses associated with stock options and rsus  was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at september  and  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of approximately million and million  respectively  as our management believes it is uncertain that it will be fully realized 
if we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination 
as of september   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for us federal and million for state tax purposes 
these loss carry forwards expire between and to the extent these net operating loss carry forwards are available  we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
based on a section analysis review  we determined that an ownership change under section occurred on may  we believe that approximately million of the million federal losses will expire unused as a result of section limitations 
the maximum annual limitation under section is approximately million for years 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carry forwards is limited  future income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carry forwards  which could result in decreased net income 
we also have state research and development credit carry forwards of approximately million  which expire commencing in fiscal results of operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts research and development   percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to increases of million in external expenses associated with our clinical trials  million in personnel and stock based compensation expenses  million in consulting fees  and million in preclinical animal studies 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  and include million each in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
in july and september  we received two national institutes of health awards for the development of concentrated ultra rapid acting insulin formulation and glucagon formulation for use in an artificial pancreas 
the july award is intended to fund research to develop a proprietary ultra rapid insulin product candidate at high concentrations suited to provide sufficient quantities of insulin in an external artificial pancreas pump device that has limited volume capacity 
the july award is for two years and totals thousand 
the september award is intended to fund research to develop a proprietary glucagon product candidate optimized to algorithmically deliver glucagon as part of a bi hormonal closed loop system to mitigate hypoglycemic events 
the september award is for two years and totals thousand 
for the year ended september   we reported thousand in government grants for the high concentration ultra rapid insulin product candidate and thousand for the glucagon formulation work 
general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative   percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to the adjusted allocation of bonus expense between general and administrative and research and development  which decreased general and administrative expense by million when compared to the year ended september  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  and include million and million  respectively  in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and non employee directors 
interest and other income 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily due to lower cash balances during the year 
interest expense 
for the years ended september  and  we had no interest expense 
adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability august warrant may warrant  june warrant  total    percentage of net loss the change in fair value of derivative instruments warrants of  during the year ended september  was primarily a result of the increase in the price of the common stock from per share at september  to per share at september  the change in fair value of common stock warrant liability of  during the year ended september  was primarily due to shorter terms and reduced volatility 
net loss and net loss per share 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts net loss    net loss per share net loss was million  or per share  for the year ended september   compared to million  or per share  for the year ended september  the decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability and general and administrative expenses  offset by an increase in research and development expenses as noted above 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts research and development   percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions of million in manufacturing expenses and million in regulatory expenses 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase of million in clinical expenses related primarily to our phase clinical trial of biod and biod and a net increase of million in research and development expenses related to an increase in the number of preclinical animal studies we conducted and a licensing fee paid to aegis 
the reductions in manufacturing expenses are attributable to savings of million as a result of renegotiating the terms of our supply agreement for rhi and million in reduced personnel costs 
the million reduction in regulatory expenses resulted from lower professional fees for the year ended september   as compared to  and lower stock based compensation costs 
research and development expenses for the twelve months ended september  were reduced by our receipt in january of approximately million in research grants under the internal revenue service therapeutic tax credit program and were increased by a million severance charge resulting from the retirement of our former chief scientific officer 
research and development expenses for the years ended september  and include million and million  respectively  in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
in july and september  we received two national institutes of health awards for the development of concentrated ultra rapid acting insulin formulation and glucagon formulation for use in an artificial pancreas

the september award is for two years and totals thousand 
for the year ended september   we reported thousand in government grants for the high concentration ultra rapid insulin product candidate and did not start the glucagon formulation work 
general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative   percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to reductions of million in depreciation expense due primarily to fully depreciating our accounting software  million in employee and non employee director stock based compensation expenses  and other expenses of million

in december  the exercise price of the warrants was reset to per share and in may  the exercise price of the warrants was reset to per share 
in august  warrants for a total of  shares were exercised and we received proceeds of approximately thousand 
the remaining warrants for  shares expired unexercised on december  funding requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least until the second calendar quarter of we have based this estimate upon assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
our existing capital resources are not sufficient to complete our clinical development program for an ultra rapid acting insulin product candidate 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and to the extent that we may or may not enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress  timing or success of our research and development and clinical programs for our product candidates  the degree to which our ongoing assessment of the data from our recently completed phase clinical trial of biod  our lead candidate for an ultra rapid acting insulin formulation  and our related chemistry  manufacturing and controls development work  support further clinical development by us or our potential partners  our ability to successfully use the data from our phase clinical trial of biod to design and conduct the pivotal clinical trials required by the or fda to secure approval to commercialize that candidate  the success of our formulation development work to improve the stability of our newer ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations while maintaining the pharmacokinetic and injection site toleration characteristics associated with earlier formulations  our ability to conduct the development work necessary to finalize the formulation and design of our dual chamber glucagon rescue product candidate  as well as the preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing activities necessary to support the filing of an nda to the fda for that product candidate  the results of our real time stability programs for our rhi  insulin analog and glucagon based product candidates  including the reproducibility of earlier  smaller scale  stability studies and our ability to accurately project long term stability on the basis of accelerated testing  our ability to accurately anticipate technical challenges that we may face in the development of our ultra rapid acting rhi and insulin analog based product candidates or our glucagon rescue product candidates  our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the ffdca  our ability to enter into collaboration arrangements for the commercialization of our product candidates and the success or failure of any such collaborations into which we enter  or our ability to commercialize our product candidates ourselves  our ability to enforce our patents for our product candidates and our ability to secure additional patents for our product candidates  our ability to protect our intellectual property and operate our business without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  the degree of clinical utility of our product candidates  particularly with regard to our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations  which have not yet been shown to be clinically superior to existing rapid acting insulin analogs  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  such as advancements in glucagon stabilization technologies that could enable a room temperature rescue product in a portable  easy to use presentation  the ability of our contract manufacturing organizations or collaborators to produce our products in our final dosage form  our ability to secure adequate supplies of active pharmaceutical ingredients to support our product development programs and  if successful  the commercialization one or more product candidates  our capabilities and strategies for manufacturing  marketing and commercializing a product candidate  and our ability to accurately estimate anticipated operating losses  future revenues  capital requirements and our needs for additional financing 
we do not anticipate generating product revenue for the next few years 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several years 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
we may receive additional proceeds from the exercise of the warrants that we issued in connection with our may registered direct offering and our june private placement  if any of those warrants are exercised for cash 
whether the warrants are exercised for cash will depend on decisions made by the warrant holders and on whether the market price of our common stock exceeds the per share warrant exercise price of the may warrants or the per share warrant exercise price of the june warrants 
the may warrants and the june warrants will expire on may  and june   respectively 
while we continue to pursue cost saving initiatives to reduce operating expenses  we will also need to raise additional funds and periodically explore sources of equity or debt financing 
we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity financings  partnerships  joint ventures  debt financings  bank borrowings or other sources 
however  additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing shareholders may result 
if we fail to obtain additional capital when needed  we may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements
