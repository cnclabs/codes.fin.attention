overview we are a leading north american supplier of coated papers to catalog and magazine publishers 
coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications  including catalogs  magazines  and commercial printing applications  such as high end advertising brochures  annual reports  and direct mail advertising 
we are one of north america s largest producers of coated groundwood paper which is used primarily for catalogs and magazines 
we are also a low cost producer of coated freesheet paper which is used primarily for annual reports  brochures  and magazine covers 
we also produce and sell market kraft pulp which is used to manufacture printing and writing paper grades and tissue products 
background we began operations on august   when we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the business of international paper 
we were formed by affiliates of apollo for the purpose of consummating the acquisition from international paper 
verso paper went public on may   with an ipo of million shares of common stock 
selected factors affecting operating results net sales our sales  which we report net of rebates  allowances  and discounts  are a function of the number of tons of paper that we sell and the price at which we sell our paper 
the coated paper industry is cyclical  which results in changes in both volume and price 
paper prices historically have been a function of macro economic factors which influence supply and demand 
price has historically been substantially more variable than volume and can change significantly over relatively short time periods 
our average coated paper prices declined from through the first quarter of while our average coated paper prices climbed modestly beginning in the second quarter of through the third quarter of  in late and they declined again 
prices may not improve  and we do not expect prices in to return to the levels they were at in before they declined 
recent industry forecasts have predicted that prices for both coated freesheet and coated groundwood will remain stable through the first quarter of we are primarily focused on serving two end user segments catalogs and magazines 
in  we believe we were a leading north american supplier of coated papers to catalog and magazine publishers 
coated paper demand is primarily driven by advertising and print media usage 
advertising spending and magazine and catalog circulation tend to correlate with changes in the gdp of the united states they rise with a strong economy and contract with a weak economy 
many of our customers provide us with forecasts of their paper needs  which allows us to plan our production runs in advance  optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency 
generally  our sales agreements do not extend beyond the calendar year 
typically  our sales agreements provide for quarterly price adjustments based on market price movements 
we reach our end users through several channels  including printers  brokers  paper merchants  and direct sales to end users 
we sell and market our products to approximately customers which comprise approximately end user accounts 
in  quad graphics  inc accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
our historical results include specialty papers that we manufacture for thilmany  llc  or thilmany  on paper machine no 
at the androscoggin mill 
under a long term supply agreement entered into in in connection with international paper s sale of its industrial papers business to thilmany  these products are sold to thilmany at a variable charge for the paper purchased and a fixed charge for the availability of the machine 
the amounts included in our net sales for the specialty papers sold to thilmany totaled million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
cost of products sold the principal components of our cost of sales are chemicals  wood  energy  labor  and maintenance 
costs for commodities  including chemicals  wood  and energy  are the most variable component of our cost of sales because their prices can fluctuate substantially  sometimes within a relatively short period of time 
in addition  our aggregate commodity purchases fluctuate based on the volume of paper that we produce 
chemicals 
chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated papers include latex  clay  starch  calcium carbonate  caustic soda  sodium chlorate  and titanium dioxide 
we purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs 
we expect imbalances in supply and demand to periodically create volatility in prices for certain chemicals 
wood 
our costs to purchase wood are affected directly by market costs of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the effect of higher fuel costs on logging and transportation of timber to our facilities 
while we have in place fiber supply agreements that ensure a substantial portion of our wood requirements  purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates 
energy 
we produce approximately of our energy needs for our paper mills from sources such as waste wood  waste water  hydroelectric facilities  liquid biomass from our pulping process  and internal energy cogeneration facilities 
our external energy purchases vary across each of our mills and include fuel oil  natural gas  coal  and electricity 
while our internal energy production capacity and ability to switch between certain energy sources mitigates the volatility of our overall energy expenditures  we expect prices for energy to remain volatile for the foreseeable future 
we utilize derivative contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices 
at the end of  we completed a million renewable energy project at our mill in quinnesec  michigan that is exceeding expectations for efficiency and cost savings 
in november  we completed and commercialized a million renewable energy project at our mill in bucksport  maine 
labor 
labor costs include wages  salary  and benefit expenses attributable to our mill personnel 
mill employees at a non managerial level are compensated on an hourly basis 
management employees at our mills are compensated on a salaried basis 
wages  salary  and benefit expenses included in cost of sales do not vary significantly over the short term 
in addition  we have not experienced significant labor shortages 
maintenance 
maintenance expense includes day to day maintenance  equipment repairs  and larger maintenance projects  such as paper machine shutdowns for periodic maintenance 
day to day maintenance expenses have not varied significantly from year to year 
larger maintenance projects and equipment expenses can produce year to year fluctuations in our maintenance expenses 
in conjunction with our periodic maintenance shutdowns  we have incidental incremental costs that are primarily comprised of unabsorbed fixed costs from lower production volumes and other incremental costs for purchased materials and energy that would otherwise be produced as part of the normal operation of our mills 
depreciation  amortization  and depletion 
depreciation  amortization  and depletion expense represents the periodic charge to earnings through which the cost of tangible assets  intangible assets  and natural resources are recognized over the asset s life 
capital investments can increase our asset bases and produce year to year fluctuations in expense 
selling  general  and administrative expenses the principal components of our selling  general  and administrative expenses are wages  salaries  and benefits for our office personnel at our headquarters and our sales force  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising expenses  expenses relating to certain information technology systems  and research and development expenses 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industry in which we operate 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions in determining accounting estimates 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  that would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments about critical accounting estimates are based on information available to us as of the date of the financial statements 
accounting standards whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position  and that can require judgments by management that affect their application  include the following financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  contingencies  asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  and asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use 
in  based on a comprehensive assessment of the damage resulting from the fire and explosion at our paper mill in sartell  minnesota  we decided to permanently close the mill and recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of million  which is included in restructuring charges on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge was calculated based on the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the site  which was estimated based on preliminary negotiations with potential buyers received subsequent to our decision to shut down the mill 
goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with asc topic intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks  customer related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions 
we have identified the following trademarks as intangible assets with an indefinite life influence  liberty  and advocate 
we assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
trademarks are evaluated by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flow to their carrying values 
during  based on a projected reduction of revenue primarily as a result of a reduction in production capacity from the closure of the sartell mill  we recognized a trademarks impairment charge of million  which is included in restructuring charges on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill was evaluated at the reporting unit level and has been allocated to the coated segment 
we tested goodwill for impairment by applying a two step test 
the first step was to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount  goodwill was considered impaired and the loss was measured by performing step two  which involved using a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  step two was required if it was more likely than not that a goodwill impairment existed 
an impairment loss was recognized to the extent the implied fair value of the goodwill was less than the carrying amount of the goodwill 
during  based on a combination of factors  including the difficult market conditions that resulted in a decline in customer demand and excess capacity in the coated paper markets and high raw material  energy and distribution costs that have challenged the profitability of our products  we concluded sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
upon finalizing our analysis during the fourth quarter of  verso paper recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million and verso holdings recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
we had no goodwill remaining as of december  management believes that the accounting estimates associated with determining fair value as part of an impairment analysis are critical accounting estimates because estimates and assumptions are made about our future performance and cash flows 
the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
we also consider a market based approach and a combination of both 
while management uses the best information available to estimate future performance and cash flows  future adjustments to management s projections may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates 
pension benefit obligations 
we offer various pension plans to employees 
the calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates  and mortality rates 
actuarial valuations and assumptions used in the determination of future values of plan assets and liabilities are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used 
contingent liabilities 
a liability is contingent if the outcome or amount is not presently known  but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event 
we estimate our contingent liabilities based on management s estimates about the probability of outcomes and their ability to estimate the range of exposure 
accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event 
as part of the estimation process  management is required to make assumptions about matters that are by their nature highly uncertain 
the assessment of contingent liabilities  including legal contingencies  asset retirement obligations and environmental costs and obligations  involves the use of critical estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
management s estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not differ from management s assessments 
recent accounting developments asc topic  comprehensive income 
accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 comprehensive income topic  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  requires additional disclosure about the amounts being reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  or aoci  by component 
an entity is required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  is intended to simplify the guidance for impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
under the new guidance  an entity will have the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
entities electing to perform a qualitative assessment are no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after september   however  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other new accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after december   are not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements

in  we completed a comprehensive assessment of the damage resulting from the fire and explosion at our paper mill in sartell  minnesota  and announced the decision to permanently close the mill 
the permanent closure of the sartell mill reduced our annual coated groundwood paper capacity by  tons  or approximately  and eliminated approximately  tons annually of supercalendered paper capacity 
in conjunction with the closure  our workforce was reduced by approximately employees 
the closure of sartell resulted in charges of million in we continued to focus on improving our capital structure in on april   we completed the refinancing of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due  which were replaced with million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due on may   we entered into new revolving credit facilities consisting of a million asset based loan facility or abl facility  and a million cash flow facility or cash flow facility

reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to adjusted ebitda ebitda consists of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
ebitda is a measure commonly used in our industry  and we present ebitda to enhance your understanding of our operating performance 
we use ebitda as a way of evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers 
we believe that ebitda is an operating performance measure  and not a liquidity measure  that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  capital investment cycles  and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies 
see our reconciliation of ebitda to net income provided in item  selected financial data 
adjusted ebitda is ebitda further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indentures governing our debt securities 
adjusted ebitda is modified to align the mark to market impact of derivative contracts used to economically hedge a portion of future natural gas purchases with the period in which the contracts settle 
you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and to consider whether the adjustment is appropriate 
in addition  in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future  we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments included in the presentation of adjusted ebitda 
we believe that the supplemental adjustments applied in calculating adjusted ebitda are reasonable and appropriate to provide additional information to investors 
we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful liquidity measurement tool for assessing our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
you should consider our ebitda and adjusted ebitda in addition to  and not as a substitute for or superior to  our operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap 
the following table reconciles cash flows from operating activities to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the periods presented verso paper year ended december  dollars in millions cash flows from operating activities income tax expense amortization of debt issuance costs accretion of discount on long term debt loss gain on early extinguishment of debt  net asset impairment goodwill impairment equity award expense interest income interest expense gain loss on disposal of fixed assets other  net changes in assets and liabilities  net ebitda restructuring charges gain on insurance settlement goodwill impairment loss gain on early extinguishment of debt  net hedge gains losses equity award expense other items  net adjusted ebitda before pro forma effects of profitability program represents costs associated with the closure of the sartell mill in and the shutdown of three paper machines in represents gain on insurance settlement resulting from the fire at our sartell mill 
represents impairment of goodwill allocated to the coated paper segment 
represents net loss gain related to debt refinancing 
represents unrealized gains losses on energy related derivative contracts 
represents amortization of non cash incentive compensation 
represents miscellaneous non cash and other earnings adjustments 
seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly net sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the coated paper industry 
typically  the first two quarters are our slowest quarters due to lower demand for coated paper during this period 
our third quarter is generally our strongest quarter  reflecting an increase in printing related to end of year magazines  increased end of year direct mailings  and holiday season catalogs 
our working capital and accounts receivable generally peak in the third quarter  while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the third quarter season 
we expect our seasonality trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources we rely primarily upon cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to finance operations  capital expenditures  and fluctuations in debt service requirements 
as of december   million was available for future borrowing under our revolving credit facilities 
we believe that our ability to manage cash flow and working capital levels  particularly inventory and accounts payable  will allow us to meet our current and future obligations  pay scheduled principal and interest payments  and provide funds for working capital  capital expenditures  and other needs of the business for at least the next twelve months 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our revolving credit facilities in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
as we focus on managing our expenses and cash flows  we continue to assess and implement  as appropriate  various earnings enhancement and expense reduction initiatives 
management has developed a company wide cost reduction program and expects to yield approximately million of additional cost reductions  of which  approximately million are expected to be realized in  and the remaining million are expected to be realized in we continue to search for and develop additional cost savings measures 
verso paper s and verso holdings cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table 
verso paper verso holdings year ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
in  verso paper s net cash provided by operating activities of million reflects a net loss of million adjusted for non cash depreciation  amortization  depletion  and accretion and non cash losses on early extinguishment of debt and asset impairment charges totaling million and a decrease in working capital of million  which was primarily due to decreases in inventory and accounts receivable 
in  verso paper s net cash provided by operating activities of million reflects a net loss of million adjusted for non cash depreciation  amortization  depletion  and accretion and non cash losses on early extinguishment of debt and goodwill impairment totaling million and an increase in working capital of million  which was primarily due to increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
verso paper s net cash provided by operating activities of million in was primarily attributable to a net loss of million adjusted for non cash depreciation  amortization  depletion  and accretion charges of million and cash provided by improvements in working capital of million 
cash flows from working capital increased primarily due to planned reductions in inventory levels  increased accounts payable reflecting the higher sales volume in  and higher accrued liabilities 
verso holdings operating cash flows are the same as those of verso paper in all material respects 
investing activities 
in  verso paper s net cash used in investing activities of million reflects million in capital expenditures net of million received from governmental grants associated with a renewable energy project at our mill in quinnesec  michigan and million in proceeds attributable to property  plant and equipment from the insurance settlement related to the fire at our sartell mill 
this compares to million of net cash used in investing activities in  which reflects million in capital expenditures net of million in funds transferred from restricted cash for use on a renewable energy project at our mill in quinnesec  michigan  and million of net cash used in investing activities in  which included million of capital expenditures and million of cash transferred to restricted cash for the renewable energy project

as of december   verso holdings total indebtedness was  million  net of million of unamortized discounts 
revolving credit facilities 
on may   verso holdings entered into new revolving credit facilities consisting of a million abl facility and a million cash flow facility 
the revolving credit facilities were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the prior million revolving credit facility and will be used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes 
the indebtedness under the revolving credit facilities bears interest at a floating rate based on a margin over a base rate or eurocurrency rate 
as december   the applicable margin for advances under the abl facility was for base rate advances and for libor advances  and the applicable margin for advances under the cash flow facility was for base rate advances and for libor advances 
verso holdings is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders in respect of the unused commitments under the abl facility at an annual rate initially equal to and thereafter of either or  based on daily average utilization  and under the cash flow facility at an annual rate of 
the indebtedness under the revolving credit facilities is guaranteed jointly and severally by verso finance and each of verso holdings subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions  and the indebtedness and guarantees are senior secured obligations of verso holdings and the guarantors  respectively 
the indebtedness under the abl facility and related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests  subject to permitted liens  in substantially all of verso holdings  verso finance s  and the subsidiary guarantors inventory and accounts receivable  or abl priority collateral  and second priority security interests  subject to permitted liens  in substantially all of their other assets  or notes priority collateral 
the indebtedness under the cash flow facility and related guarantees are secured  pari passu with the senior secured notes due and related guarantees  by first priority security interests in the notes priority collateral and second priority security interests in the abl priority collateral 
the revolving facilities will mature on may   unless  on any of the dates that is days prior to the earliest scheduled maturity of any of the second priority senior secured floating rate notes due  the senior subordinated notes  or the senior unsecured term loan  an aggregate principal amount in excess of million of indebtedness under such existing second lien notes  subordinated notes or senior unsecured term loan  as applicable  is outstanding  in which case the revolving credit facilities will mature on such earlier date 
the abl facility had no amounts outstanding  million in letters of credit issued  and million available for future borrowing as of december  the cash flow facility had no outstanding balance  no letters of credit issued  and million available for future borrowing as of december senior secured notes due in june and january  verso holdings issued a total of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due in march  verso holdings repurchased and retired million aggregate principal amount of the notes

under this arrangement  verso holdings loaned million to verso finance at an interest rate of per year and with a maturity of december   and verso finance  in turn  loaned the funds on similar terms to the investment fund 
the investment fund then contributed the loan proceeds to certain community development entities  which  in turn  loaned the funds on similar terms to verso quinnesec rep llc as partial financing for the renewable energy project at our mill in quinnesec  michigan 
senior unsecured term loan 
verso finance  the parent entity of verso holdings  had million outstanding on its senior unsecured term loan as of december  the loan allows verso finance to pay interest either in cash or in kind through the accumulation of the outstanding principal amount 
the loan bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus per year for interest paid in kind  or pik 
as of december   the interest rate on the loan was per year 
verso finance elected to exercise the pik option for million  million  and million of interest payments due   and  respectively 
on january   verso holdings issued million aggregate principal amount of its senior secured notes due to certain lenders holding approximately million aggregate principal amount of verso finance s senior unsecured term loans  and net accrued interest through the closing date  at an exchange rate of  in exchange for the assignment to verso finance of the senior unsecured term loans and the cancellation of such loans 
there are no longer any outstanding senior unsecured term loans 
in accordance with asc topic  the senior unsecured term loans exchanged on january  are reflected in long term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  as a holding company  verso paper s investments in its operating subsidiaries constitute substantially all of its operating assets 
consequently  verso paper s subsidiaries conduct all of its consolidated operations and own substantially all of its operating assets 
verso paper s principal source of the cash it needs to pay its debts is the cash that its subsidiaries generate from their operations and their borrowings 
verso paper s subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to it 
the terms of the revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing the outstanding notes of verso paper s subsidiaries significantly restrict its subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to verso paper 
furthermore  verso paper s subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the revolving credit facilities and the indentures to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends  or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to verso paper 
although the terms of the debt agreements of verso paper s subsidiaries do not restrict its operating subsidiaries from obtaining funds from their respective subsidiaries to fund their operations and payments on indebtedness  there can be no assurance that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of its subsidiaries will permit its subsidiaries to provide verso paper with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund its obligations or pay dividends to its stockholders 
we may elect to retire our outstanding debt in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
these repurchases may be funded through available cash from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
such repurchases are dependent on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
covenant compliance the credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes contain affirmative covenants as well as restrictive covenants which limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  repurchase or redeem our stock  make investments  sell assets  including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and incur liens 
these covenants can result in limiting our long term growth prospects by hindering our ability to incur future indebtedness or grow through acquisitions 
the material covenants in the indentures that are impacted by the calculation of adjusted ebitda are those that govern the amount of indebtedness that verso holdings and its subsidiaries may incur  whether verso holdings may make certain dividends  distributions or payments on subordinated indebtedness  and whether verso holdings may merge with another company 
although there are limited baskets for incurring indebtedness contained in the indentures  the primary means for incurring additional indebtedness under the indentures is to have a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to after the incurrence of such additional indebtedness 
this same test also applies to most dividends and other payments made in respect of verso holdings equity and subordinated indebtedness and also to whether verso holdings may merge with another company 
in the case of a merger  verso holdings may merge so long as either its fixed charge coverage ratio is at least to or that same ratio improves after giving pro forma effect to the merger 
if verso holdings were not able to meet the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement contained in these covenants  it would limit our long term growth prospects  as it would severely hinder verso holdings ability to incur additional indebtedness for the purpose of completing acquisitions or capital improvement programs  among other things 
in addition  if the ratio test were not met  distributions by verso holdings to verso paper would also be severely restricted 
as of december   we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants in our debt agreements 
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs  such as for energy  wood fiber  and chemicals  have an impact on our operating results  changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in the last three years 
sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not be affected by general inflation in the future 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees  and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires our performance pursuant to a funding commitment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in our paper prices  interest rates  energy prices  and commodity prices for our inputs 
paper prices our sales  which we report net of rebates  allowances  and discounts  are a function of the number of tons of paper that we sell and the price at which we sell our paper 
the coated paper industry is cyclical  which results in changes in both volume and price 
paper prices historically have been a function of macro economic factors  which influence supply and demand 
price has historically been substantially more variable than volume and can change significantly over relatively short time periods 
we are primarily focused on serving two end user segments catalogs and magazines 
coated paper demand is primarily driven by advertising and print media usage 
advertising spending and magazine and catalog circulation tend to correlate with gdp in the united states they rise with a strong economy and contract with a weak economy 
many of our customers provide us with forecasts of their paper needs  which allows us to plan our production runs in advance  optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency 
generally  our sales agreements do not extend beyond the calendar year 
typically  our sales agreements provide for quarterly price adjustments based on market price movements 
we reach our end users through several channels  including printers  brokers  paper merchants  and direct sales to end users 
we sell and market our products to approximately customers 
in  quad graphics  inc accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
interest rates we have issued fixed and floating rate debt in order to manage our variability to cash flows from interest rates 
borrowings under the revolving credit facilities  the second priority senior secured floating rate notes due  and the senior unsecured term loan accrue interest at variable rates 
a basis point increase in quoted interest rates on verso paper s outstanding floating rate debt as of december   would increase annual interest expense by million of which million is attributable to the senior unsecured term loan on which we have elected to pay interest in kind 
a basis point increase in quoted interest rates on verso holdings outstanding floating rate notes as of december   would increase annual interest expense by million 
while we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates  any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 
derivatives in the normal course of business  we utilize derivatives contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices and interest rates 
these instruments are subject to credit and market risks in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
controls and monitoring procedures for these instruments have been established and are routinely reevaluated 
we have an energy risk management policy which was adopted by our board of directors and is monitored by an energy risk management committee composed of our senior management 
in addition  we have an interest rate risk committee which was formed to monitor our interest rate risk management policy 
credit risk represents the potential loss that may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the measure of credit exposure is the replacement cost of contracts with a positive fair value 
we manage credit risk by entering into financial instrument transactions only through approved counterparties 
market risk represents the potential loss due to the decrease in the value of a financial instrument caused primarily by changes in commodity prices or interest rates 
we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
we do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility for a variety of reasons 
to the extent that we do not hedge against commodity price volatility  our results of operations may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by a shift in the future price curve 
as of december   we had liabilities for net unrealized losses of million on open commodity contracts with maturities of one to twenty three months 
these derivative instruments involve the exchange of net cash settlements  based on changes in the price of the underlying commodity index compared to the fixed price offering  at specified intervals without the exchange of any underlying principal 
a decrease in commodity prices would have a negative impact of approximately million on the fair value of such instruments 
this quantification of exposure to market risk does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in prices on anticipated future energy purchases 
commodity prices we are subject to changes in our cost of sales caused by movements underlying commodity prices 
the principal components of our cost of sales are chemicals  wood  energy  labor  maintenance  and depreciation  amortization  and depletion 
costs for commodities  including chemicals  wood and energy  are the most variable component of our cost of sales because their prices can fluctuate substantially  sometimes within a relatively short period of time 
in addition  our aggregate commodity purchases fluctuate based on the volume of paper that we produce 
chemicals 
chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated papers include latex  clay  starch  calcium carbonate  caustic soda  sodium chlorate  and titanium dioxide 
we purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs 
we expect imbalances in supply and demand to periodically create volatility in prices for certain chemicals 
wood 
our costs to purchase wood are affected directly by market costs of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the effect of higher fuel costs on logging and transportation of timber to our facilities 
while we have in place fiber supply agreements that ensure a substantial portion of our wood requirements  purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates 
energy 
we produce approximately of our energy needs for our paper mills from sources such as waste wood  waste water  hydroelectric facilities  liquid biomass from our pulping process  and internal energy cogeneration facilities 
our external energy purchases vary across each of our mills and include fuel oil  natural gas  coal  and electricity 
while our internal energy production capacity and ability to switch between certain energy sources mitigates the volatility of our overall energy expenditures  we expect prices for energy to remain volatile for the foreseeable future 
we utilize derivatives contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices
