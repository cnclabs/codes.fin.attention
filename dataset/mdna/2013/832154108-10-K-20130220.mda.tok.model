under this program  stock repurchases may be made from time to time and the actual amount 
table of contents expended will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions  regulatory and legal requirements  corporate cash generation and other factors

we are hopeful that our new products will gain market acceptance in order to increase our revenues in upcoming quarters 
if our new products do not gain market acceptance  or market acceptance is slower than anticipated  then we anticipate that it will be necessary to undertake additional restructuring to lower costs to bring them more in line with actual revenues  thus slowing the use of cash 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us at commercially reasonable terms or at all

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total during our normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions

we may also issue a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain customer contracts 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees may not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as it becomes available 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we currently report our net revenues under two operating groups wireless and productivity graphics 
within each of these groups software revenue is recognized based on the customer and contract type 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable as required by fasb asc topic no 
 software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software to our customers or end users as completed products are shipped and title passes  or from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  if the other requirements are met 
if the requirements are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognized until these elements are known or resolved 
for wireless sales  returns from customers are limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
historically  customer returns have not exceeded the very nominal estimates and reserves 
we also provide some technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 
we have a few multiple element agreements for which we have contracted to provide a perpetual license for use of proprietary software  to provide non recurring engineering  and in some cases to provide software maintenance post contract support 
for these software and software related multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  and allocate the total price among the various elements 
vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements 
absent vsoe  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
however  if the only undelivered element is post contract support  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
we have established vsoe for our post contract support services and non recurring engineering 
for productivity graphics sales  management reviews available retail channel information and makes a determination of a return provision for sales made to distributors and retailers based on current channel inventory levels and historical return patterns 
certain sales to distributors or retailers are made on a consignment basis 
revenue for consignment sales are not recognized until sell through to the final customer is established 
certain revenues are booked net of revenue sharing payments 
sales directly to end users are recognized upon shipment 
end users have a thirty day right of return  but such returns are reasonably estimable and have historically been immaterial 
we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 

table of contents sales incentives for our productivity graphics sales  the cost of sales incentives the company offers without charge to customers that can be used in  or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of  a single exchange transaction is accounted for as a reduction of revenue as required by fasb asc topic no 
 software revenue recognition 
we use historical redemption rates to estimate the cost of customer incentives 
total sales incentives were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we estimate credit losses and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts reserve based upon these estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within our estimated reserves  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
internal software development costs development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
the company considers technological feasibility to be established when all planning  designing  coding and testing has been completed according to design specifications 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs are capitalized 
through december   software has been substantially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  accordingly  no costs have been capitalized to date 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets during the period ended september   the company concluded that a decline in its stock price and market capitalization was representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
the triggering events that led us to this conclusion were revenues declined for the third consecutive quarter 
new product launches although we were in trials for several of our new products  as of september  we had not realized any revenues from these new products 
profitability declined for the third consecutive quarter 
stock price remained at depressed prices 
as such  the company performed step of the goodwill impairment test which failed  triggering step as a result of this analysis  the excess of the carrying value of goodwill was compared to the implied fair value of goodwill and resulted in an impairment loss of million in the fiscal quarter ended september  as a result of the triggering events described above in our goodwill impairment analysis  the company reviewed its long lived assets for recoverability 
as a result of this analysis  the company recognized a long lived asset impairment charge of million in the fiscal quarter ended september  which was allocated pro rata to the intangible assets of million and million to equipment and improvements  primarily related to our leasehold improvements 
as a result of the million goodwill and long lived asset impairment charge recorded in the fiscal quarter ended september   there were no more goodwill or intangible assets on the balance sheet as of that date 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes as required by fasb asc topic no 
 income taxes 
this topic clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  we are required to evaluate the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against its deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not realization standard 
the four sources of taxable income that must be considered in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized are future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset of gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the applicable tax law  tax planning strategies and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is required  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a significant factor in the company s assessment is that the company was in a three year historical cumulative loss as of the end of fiscal this fact  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced the company s ability to rely on projections of future taxable income in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
after a review of the four sources of taxable income as of december  as described above  and after consideration of the company s three year cumulative loss position as of december   the company recorded a valuation allowance related to its us based deferred tax amounts  with a corresponding charge to income tax expense  of million during the year ended december  stock based compensation the company accounts for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors based on their fair values and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight line method over the requisite service period for each award as required by fasb asc topic no

the amendments in this update result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
consequently  the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the company has implemented this guidance and its adoption has not had an impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
foreign currency risk while a majority of our business is denominated in us dollars  we do occasionally invoice in foreign currencies 
for the three years ended december   and  our revenues denominated in foreign currencies were million  million  and million  respectively 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and certain other currencies may affect our results of operations and period to period comparisons of our operating results 
we do not currently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce these risks 
the operational expenses of our foreign entities reduce the currency exposure we have because our foreign currency revenues are offset in part by expenses payable in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not believe we have a material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations at this time
