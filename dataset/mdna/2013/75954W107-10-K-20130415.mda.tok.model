under the equity method through november  we recorded a loss of million 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million 
these losses represent our share in sharecare s loss during those periods  which was offset by the change in interest gain 
liquidity and capital resources our cash balance was approximately million as of december   a decrease of approximately million over our cash balance as of december  on november   the company entered into a million term loan agreement  at a annual interest rate with a lender controlled by and in part owned by mr 
kai shing tao  the company s chairman and chief executive officer 
mr 
tao has been a director of the company since the term loan is secured by substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of the company  excluding its shares of common stock of sharecare 
the principal and accrued interest under the term loan agreement is convertible into common stock of the company at the rate of per share  which represents an approximately premium to the average closing prices of the company s common stock for the ten days prior to entrance into the agreement and an approximately premium to the closing price of the company s common stock on the day of entrance into the agreement 
this term loan agreement was approved by the audit committee of the board  which believes the related party transaction was negotiated as an arms length transaction 
the full balance is due november on april   the company entered into a million senior secured convertible promissory note promissory note  at a annual interest rate for the first year and for the second year  with a lender controlled by and in part owned by mr 
kai shing tao  the company s chairman and chief executive officer 
the promissory note is secured pursuant to the term loan agreement detailed above  as amended by amendment number one amendment to that term loan agreement  dated april  the principal and accrued interest under the promissory note is convertible into common stock of the company at the rate of per share  which represents an approximately premium to the average closing prices of the company s common stock for the ten days prior to entrance into the agreement and an approximately premium to the closing price of the company s common stock on the day of entrance into the agreement 
this promissory note and amendment were approved by the audit committee of the board  which believes the related party transaction was negotiated as an arms length transaction 
the proceeds from this promissory note and amendment will be used to fund future acquisitions and the ongoing operations of the business  in conjunction with revenue growth in the brands segment 
the full balance is due april finally the company has taken steps to reduce operating costs  primarily payroll through a reduction in headcount that had previously been focused on its content and platform services business  which will result in a decline in annual salary expense of approximately million 
the company will continue to evaluate other opportunities to control costs 
the company intends to fund its future operations through a combination of revenue growth in its brands segment  particularly its personal finance properties 
additionally  the company is actively engaged in evaluating future acquisitions to provide revenue growth and the sale of certain non core assets to provide capital 
after receipt of funding of the promissory note  offset by the acquisition of pop factory  the balance of cash and cash equivalents would be approximately million had these occurred as of december  the company has incurred net losses and generated substantial negative cash flow from operations in and in each fiscal year since its inception and has an accumulated deficit of million as of december  the company had minimal revenues in due to the termination of certain agreements in the content and platform services segment at the end of and its transition to owning and operating its own digital media properties 
since that time  the company has been focused on building and acquiring wholly owned digital media properties for its brands segment 
we consistently monitor our cash position  and make operational changes as necessary to maintain our business objective of funding ongoing operations and related growth 
the decrease in cash is primarily due to the use of cash to fund our operating and investing activities  including website development costs and the acquisition of banks 
com  offset by the proceeds provided through the equity funding completed in february and debt funding completed in november absent any acquisitions of new businesses or the material increase in expectations from its existing customers  current revenue growth may not be sufficient to sustain the company s operations in the long term 
as such  the company may need to obtain additional equity financing and or divest of certain assets or businesses  neither of which can be assured on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  any equity financing that might be obtained would substantially dilute existing stockholders 
there is no certainty that the company will be successful at raising capital  nor is there certainty around the amount of funds that may be raised 
in addition  the success of the company will be subject to performance of the markets and investor sentiment regarding the macro and micro economic conditions under which we operate including stock market volatility 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful at generating more revenues or selling any of its assets 
any failure by the company to successfully implement these plans would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  including the possible inability to continue operations 
based on the company s current financial projections  which incorporates the services agreement with thestreet  the new term loan agreement and promissory note  and the reductions in expenses  all discussed above  the company believes it has sufficient existing cash resources to fund operations through december however  projecting operating results is inherently uncertain 
anticipated expenses can exceed those that are projected  and revenue under thestreet agreement could be delayed or not meet expectations 
accordingly  the company s cash resources could be fully utilized prior to december the table below summarizes the change in our statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and year ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows used in operating activities the net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a major decrease in revenues  offset by a decrease in content  technology and development expense and the change in interest gain 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   the net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in investing activities for primarily due to the payment of the cash consideration of million related to the banks 
com s acquisition consummated on june  and million in addition to internally developed software 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december   the net cash provided by financing activities was million  which primarily consisted of the net cash proceeds of million provided through the equity financing transactions completed in february  and the cash proceeds of million provided by the convertible note financing in november for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million which was related to payments of debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit agreement 

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we believe that our critical accounting policies  revenue recognition  stock based compensation and long lived assets including goodwill  equity investments  and other intangible assets may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the service has been provided  the fees we charge are fixed or determinable  we and our advertisers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from our owned and operated websites as visitors are exposed to or react to advertisements on our website 
we generate revenue from advertising in the form of sponsored links and image ads 
this includes both pay per performance ads and paid for impression advertising 
in the pay per performance model  we earn revenue based on the number of clicks associated with such ad  in the paid for impression model sponsorships  revenue is derived from the display of ads 
these revenues are classified within our brands segment 
we recognize advertising revenue from the service agreement with thestreet in the period it is earned 
we recognize content and platform services revenue at the time services are performed 
all of our services revenue is related to the design  development  hosting and other services required to launch and operate the sharecare  dailystrength and ask dr 
oz websites through our direct activities and management of third party vendors 
we also recognize content and platform services revenue on certain projects using a percentage of completion method 
sales are calculated based on the percentage that total costs incurred bear to total estimated costs at completion 
these revenues are classified within our content and platform services segment 
stock based compensation under the equity incentive plan adopted april   and the equity plan adopted june   as modified on december  the plans  remark media authorized a total of  shares for grant as part of a long term incentive plan to attract  retain and motivate its eligible executives  employees  officers  directors and consultants 
options to purchase common stock under the plans have been granted to our officers and employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
additionally in   and  we granted restricted shares to certain members of our board of directors and executives 
as of december   no options have been exercised under the plan 
we recognize expense based on the fair value of our stock based compensation awards 
we have elected to use the black scholes options pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of stock option awards 
we measure stock based compensation based on the fair values of all stock based awards on the dates of grant  and recognize stock based compensation expense using the straight line method over the vesting periods 
stock based compensation expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of property and equipment property and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in the business climate  the impact of significant customer losses  unanticipated current period operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
recoverability of property and equipment is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  property and equipment are grouped with other assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
in december  the company abandoned certain software development projects associated with its content and platform services business 
as a result  the company recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of impairment of investments investments are reviewed to determine if events have occurred which would indicate that a decrease in value has occurred which is other than temporary 
evidence of a loss in value might include  but would not necessarily be limited to  absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
we monitor our assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis 
no impairment charge has been recognized on our investment balances as of december  or goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment as of september   and in light of the market conditions and the cost savings measures implemented in the company s operations in china  the company performed an impairment analysis of its indefinite lived intangible asset which is a license to operate in china 
the company used the cost approach to estimate the fair value 
the company considered the inputs in this assessment to be level in the fair value hierarchy 
as a result of the assessment  the company determined that the intangible asset was impaired and recorded in the company s statement of operations for the third quarter an impairment charge of million 
in december  the company performed a qualitative assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under the step zero process 
the step zero process determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount 
after consideration of the company s market capitalization and the fact that the majority of these assets are comprised of the banks 
com merger in june  and therefore only six months since merger  the company determined there were no impairment charges of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles in recent accounting pronouncements we are subject to recent accounting pronouncements  as described in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we translate the foreign currency financial statements of our international operations into us dollars at current exchange rates  except revenue and expenses  which we translate at average exchange rates during each reporting period 
we accumulate net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities in a separate caption of stockholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
generally  our foreign expenses are denominated in the same currency as the associated foreign revenue  and at this stage of our development  the exposure to rate changes is minimal 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivables 
at december   of our cash was denominated in us dollars 
the remaining was denominated in brazilian reals  chinese renminbi or hong kong dollars 
the majority of our cash is placed with financial institutions we believe are of high credit quality 
our cash is maintained in bank deposit accounts  which  at times  exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and do not believe our cash is exposed to any significant credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure because the effects of the foreign exchange rate fluctuations are not currently significant 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of our currency risks 
the net assets of our foreign operations at december   were approximately million
