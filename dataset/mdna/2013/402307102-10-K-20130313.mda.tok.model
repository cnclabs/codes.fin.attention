item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and outlook our results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and gas exploration and production companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  foreign locations throughout the world  ii our ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii our ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends in oil and gas prices  expectations of future oil and gas prices  changes in technology and changes in the regulatory environment  including new permitting processes and increased regulation imposed on domestic oil and gas exploration by the bureau of ocean energy  regulation and enforcement 
we believe conditions in the oil and gas industry brought on by the deepwater horizon incident in have improved 
oil prices are currently stable above per barrel  global and us working drilling rig count is increasing and us gulf of mexico permitting activity is on the rise  particularly in deepwater offshore locations 
we believe demand for deepwater and marine related projects will be driven by this increased activity 
our focus remains on managing our contract costs  particularly those associated with maintaining our labor force  as our customers face the challenge and cost of developing deepwater locations 
we are in the process of implementing new tracking and reporting procedures and have hired additional staff in order to monitor and track the progress on our projects 
we expect these initiatives to enable us to more effectively control costs in the event of customer delivery delays or deviations and discrepancies with respect to designs and drawings submitted by our customers 
in the longer term  demand for our products and services will continue to depend largely upon prices for oil and gas and the capital outlay decisions of oil and gas exploration and production companies  which at this time is difficult to predict 
backlog our backlog is based on management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete  and the remaining revenue to be recognized with respect to  those projects a customer has authorized us to begin work or purchase materials or services pursuant to written contracts  letters of intent or other forms of authorization 
often  however  management s estimates are based on preliminary engineering and design specifications by the customer and are refined together with the customer 
as engineering and design plans are finalized or changes to existing plans are made  management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete a project and the price of a project at completion is likely to change 
in addition  all projects currently included in our backlog are subject to termination at the option of the customer  although the customer is generally required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination and  in some instances  cancellation fees 
in addition  customers have the ability to delay the execution of projects 
as of december   we had a revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of approximately million man hours remaining to work  including commitments received through march  and excluding backlog of million relating to the suspended cheviot project  compared to revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of million man hours reported as of december  we exclude suspended projects from contract backlog because resumption of work and timing of backlog revenues are difficult to predict 
of our backlog at december   was pursuant to letters of intent received after december  for which the full scope of work has not been authorized but we expect to receive 
was for three customers as compared to for two customers at december  million  or  represented projects destined for deepwater locations compared to million  or  at december  million  or  represented projects destined for foreign locations compared to million  or  at december  depending on the size of the project  the termination or postponement of any one of our deepwater projects could significantly reduce our backlog  and could have a material adverse effect on revenue  net income and cash flow

table of contents 
index to financial statements factors our backlog is subject to change as a result of changes to management s estimates  suspension or termination of projects currently in our backlog or our failure to secure additional projects 
our revenue  net income and cash flow could be adversely affected as a result of changes to our backlog 
as of december   we expect to recognize revenues from our backlog of approximately million  or  during the calendar year  million  or  during calendar year  and million  or  thereafter 
recognition of backlog revenue as presented above is based on management estimates of the application of the direct labor hours of the backlog during the current projected timelines to complete the projects 
certain factors and circumstances  as mentioned above  could cause changes in the period when the backlog is recognized as revenue 
workforce during  our workforce ranged from approximately  to  demand for our products and services dictates our workforce needs 
although we generally try to minimize the use of contract labor  we will use contract labor when required to meet customer demand 
for  our use of contract labor ranged from approximately to contract laborers 
due to the award of significant contracts at the end of and during  we focused on hiring and maintaining manpower through to meet the level of activity 
man hours worked were million  million and million for the years ending december   and respectively 
the major factor contributing to the significant increase in man hours worked in was our ability to work on two major deepwater projects in our backlog during the year 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours actually performed to date compared to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  we would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
some contracts include a total or partial reimbursement to us of any costs associated with specific capital projects required by the fabrication process 
if a particular capital project provides future benefits to us  the cost to build the capital project will be capitalized  and the revenue for the capital project will increase the estimated profit in the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies and tools 
also included in contract costs are a portion of those indirect contract costs related to plant capacity  such as depreciation  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
these indirect costs are allocated to jobs based on actual direct labor hours incurred 
profit

index to financial statements incentives are included in revenue when their realization is probable 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenue when the amount can be reliably estimated and collection is probable 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at december   we recorded revenue totaling million related to certain change orders on four projects which have been approved as to scope but not price 
we expect to resolve these change orders in the first and second quarters of at december   we also recorded revenue totaling million related to re measure units and quantities on a unit rate contract that is in progress 
we are in the process of negotiating the application of contractual unit rates to these quantities and expect to finalize these measurement packages in the first and second quarter of no revenues were recorded at december  and related to unapproved change orders 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
we recognized contract losses of million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
contract losses increased in due mainly to the increase in manhours estimated to complete one of our major deepwater projects 
on march   we entered into a change order with our customer to settle our claim relating to this project 
revenue for this change order earned by the company was recorded in the quarter ended december  the change order also includes incentives related to key milestone date and performance metrics which have not been recorded as of december  but will be recorded as revenue in future periods if and when incentive terms are met 
estimated contract losses recognized in the year ended december  were million  inclusive of the revenue recorded at december  from this change order 
our claim was related to increased man hours driven by revisions and delivery delays to specifications and designs by our customer causing out of sequence work schedules 
the customer also extended delivery of the first phase of the project multiple times as a result of these revisions and delays 
any future deliverable delays or project revisions could also result in future revisions to contract estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we routinely review individual contracts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts as we deem appropriate 
among the factors considered during the review are the financial condition of our customer and their access to financing  underlying disputes on the account  age and amount of the account and overall economic conditions 
accounts are written off only when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted 
our principal customers include major and large independent oil and gas companies and their contractors and marine vessel operators and their contractors 
this concentration of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
receivables are generally not collateralized  however  in certain instances we obtain collateral to reduce our credit exposure 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers on a short term basis

pass through costs  as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  are included in revenue  but have little or no impact on our gross margin 
for the twelve month periods ended december  and  gross profit was million of revenue and million of revenue  respectively 
factors contributing to the overall decrease in gross profit for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  include we recognized provisions for losses on contract receivables of million during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to asset impairments of million recognized during the twelve month period ended december  for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized contract losses of million during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to million recognized during the twelve month period ended december  as explained in critical accounting policies 
partially offsetting these adverse impacts on gross profit  man hours worked increased as discussed in workforce 
the increase in production had a favorable impact on margin due to the spread it provided to our fixed overhead as compared to the twelve month period ended december  our general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve month period ended december  compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  although the absolute dollar value was more  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  was compared to for the twelve month periods ended december  and  respectively 
factors that contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  include increase of  in professional fees as a result of our various contractual issues 
we anticipate these fees will continue until these issues are resolved 
increase of  in stock compensation expense mainly due to the accelerated vesting of restricted shares upon the retirement of kerry chauvin  our former ceo  in december increase of  in bank service charges resulting from the issuance of additional letters of credit related to our two major deepwater projects 
increase of  in expenses associated with setting up additional staff in our offices

this reduction in income caused a decrease in our estimated federal qualified production activities income deduction and an increase in louisiana state income tax apportionment in as compared to  reducing the overall income tax benefit recorded in compared to income tax expense recorded in liquidity and capital resources historically we have funded our business activities through funds generated from operations 
effective october   we entered into the eleventh amendment to the ninth amended and restated credit agreement which  among other things  increased our revolving line of credit from million to million and extended the term of our revolver from december  to december  our revolving line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
amounts borrowed under our revolving line of credit bear interest  at our option  at either the prime lending rate established by jpmorgan chase bank  na or libor plus percent 
we pay a fee on a quarterly basis of one fourth of one percent per annum on the weighted average unused portion of our revolving line of credit 
at march  we had million borrowed under our revolving line of credit  and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  which reduced the unused portion of our revolving line of credit to million 
we required borrowings to fund our working capital which has been adversely impacted by the suspension of the cheviot project and the extended collection of the associated bluewater receivable as discussed further in critical accounting policies 
also  as discussed in critical accounting policies  contributing to our decreased working capital were increased contract losses incurred during  primarily attributable to one of our major deepwater projects 
on march   we entered into a change order with our customer to settle our claim relating to this project 
revenue for this change order earned by the company was recorded in the quarter ended december  as a result of our entry into this change order  we expect to pay down a portion of our outstanding borrowings in the first half of we are required to maintain certain financial covenants under our revolving line of credit  including a minimum current ratio of to  a net worth minimum requirement of million  debt to net worth ratio of to  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to interest expense ratio of to as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
working capital was million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our primary uses of cash during were related to capital expenditures and an increase in our net contract position 
as of december   our investment in net contract position was million compared to million as of december   representing an increase of million 
the increase is due to timing of work performed on several larger contracts compared to scheduled contractual billing terms  the revisions to the payment terms agreed to with bluewater in august  and cost recoveries negotiated with customers 
we define net contract position as contracts receivable  contract retainage  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  materials and other amounts prepaid to subcontractors  accounts payable  and billings in excess of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
an overall increase in these contract related accounts represents a relative decrease in cash on hand for working capital needs and an increase in cash utilized by contracts in progress 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  mainly related to capital expenditures for equipment and improvements to our production facilities  including an additional million to extend the length of our graving dock at our texas facility  million for two manitowac maxer attachments for our cranes at our texas facility and million to dredge the waterways near the bulkhead of our texas facilities to accommodate larger vessels used in the installation of deepwater projects 
also included in capital expenditures were million for an additional m manitowoc crane for our gulf island facility in houma and million on the construction of a new   square foot warehouse for gulf island s east yard 
also for the twelve month period ended december   million was spent to complete the construction of a coffer cell to drain the graving dock at our texas facility 
during the fourth quarter of  the graving dock flooded unexpectedly when soil washed out from under the graving dock floor  which allowed water from the corpus christi ship channel to enter the dock through the floor and caused damage to a portion of the graving dock slab 
to prevent further flooding  the company designed and constructed a coffer cell to drain the dock and complete repairs to the slab so that it can be utilized during the fabrication stage of the williams gulfstar fps gs hull project 
of the million spent in  million of costs to build the coffer are included in contract costs for the williams project 
the remaining million has been capitalized as property as part of the graving dock or as inventory for use on future projects after its removal upon completion of the williams project 
the graving dock at our texas facility is drained and repairs to the slab are substantially complete 
the approximate cost to repair the graving dock was million  all of which has been recovered through insurance 
we anticipate capital expenditures for to be approximately million for the purchase of equipment and additional yard and facility infrastructure improvements  including million for rolling equipment to replace aging rolling equipment at our texas facility 
the million of net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and  of excess tax benefits associated with the share based payment arrangements less million in payments of dividends on common stock 
we believe that for the next twelve months  our cash on hand  our cash generated by operating activities and funds available under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and meet our working capital needs 
however  job awards may require us to issue additional letters of credit further reducing the capacity available on our revolving line of credit 
we may also expand our operations through acquisitions in the future  which may require additional equity or debt financing which we believe would be available to us  however  there can be no assurance that amounts will be available on commercial terms acceptable to us
