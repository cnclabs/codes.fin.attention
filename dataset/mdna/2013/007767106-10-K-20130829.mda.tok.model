the ipo transactions amendment to senior secured credit agreement on november   we amended our then existing senior secured credit facility  which allowed us to  among other things increase the amount of cash we could spend for acquisitions of businesses  pay certain fees to affiliates of our sponsors upon the completion of our ipo 
these fees were paid on november   and consisted of a million transaction fee which was paid to affiliates of the sponsors under the advisory agreement with them for services directly attributable to the ipo transaction fee  which was recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital  and a million termination fee  to terminate the sponsor advisory agreement with them termination fee 
the termination fee  when combined with the related write off of prepaid advisory fees  amounted to an million expense which was reported in the statement of operations as termination of sponsor advisory agreement  and change the basis for calculating our interest rate margin above libor 
ipo in november  we consummated an ipo of our common stock in which we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of million from the ipo  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  including the aforementioned million transaction fee 
in connection with the ipo  we repurchased an aggregate of million of our then existing senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loans and paid million of tender premiums and expenses related thereto  paid a million termination fee to affiliates of our sponsors to terminate the advisory agreement with them  which  including the related write off of prepaid advisory fees  resulted in an million expense  and amended our then existing senior secured credit facility  for which a million fee was paid to the lenders 
debt repurchase in december  we repurchased million of our then existing senior unsecured notes and million of our then existing senior subordinated unsecured term loans with the net proceeds of our ipo 
this resulted in a million loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs  which was comprised of the following an premium paid on the debt repurchased  which amounted to million  the write off of the related deferred financing costs of million  and professional fees of  debt transactions debt refinancing on may   we entered into a new senior secured credit facility with various lenders  consisting of a senior secured term loan facility of million and a senior secured revolving credit facility of million  to refinance million of our then outstanding debt 
the outstanding borrowings under this senior secured credit facility bore interest  prior to the amendment  payable quarterly  at a rate per annum equal to either i the base rate as defined in the new secured credit facility  plus an applicable margin of basis points  or ii the adjusted libor rate  which had a floor of basis points as defined in the new senior secured credit facility  plus an applicable margin of basis points 
the million proceeds were used to refinance million of our then outstanding debt  as follows to repay the entire outstanding balance of million under our then existing senior secured credit facility  to repurchase all of our unsecured senior notes of million  and to prepay all of our senior subordinated unsecured term loans of million 
to pay a portion of the fees and expenses totaling million in connection with the refinancing 
debt amendments on may   we amended our senior secured credit facility  which allowed us to increase the flexibility under the total leverage ratio covenant 
as a result of the amendment  the applicable libor interest margin increased from basis points to basis points 
on may   we further amended our senior secured credit facility 
the amendment increased the outstanding term loan by million to million  eliminated the total leverage ratio covenant from the term loan portion of the facility  reduced the current effective interest rate payable with respect to outstanding loans under the facility by basis points consisting of a basis point reduction of the spread over the applicable libor rate and a basis point reduction in the libor floor and extended the maturity date by eighteen months to november  the amendment also reduced the availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility from million to million  extended its maturity date to november  and made certain adjustments to the leverage covenant 
compliance with the leverage covenant is only required if the revolving credit facility is used 
factors and trends that affect our business in reading our consolidated financial statements  you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our results 
revenue there are many factors that impact our sales 
some are outside of our direct control  such as changes in government spending on space  avionics and defense programs  the buying patterns of our customers  the acceptance of new technologies  exchange rate fluctuations or general economic conditions 
for those factors outside of our direct control  we attempt to respond quickly to changes to minimize the risk of adverse consequences 
other factors are within our control  such as our pricing strategies and our product development focus 
we constantly reassess our markets and evaluate potential new end markets for our technologies 
due to our many years of experience in our markets  we often are part of our customers fundamental design strategies  which gives us greater visibility into potential new products and market demand 
we often design and develop platform specific and customized products for our customers 
although our product offerings and customer base are broad and diverse  sales derived from our ten largest customers as a percentage of our net sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our major customers often use our products in multiple systems or programs  sometimes developed by different business units within the customer organization 
while the composition of our top ten customers varies from year to year  we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
no single customer exceeded of our net sales in fiscal  or approximately of our sales in fiscal  of our sales in fiscal and of our sales in fiscal were to agencies of the united states government or to prime defense contractors or subcontractors of the united states government 
gross margin our gross margin in any period is significantly affected by product mix  that is  the percentage of our revenue in that period that is attributable to higher or lower margin products and to a lesser extent  by pricing 
the impact of product mix is evident in fiscal  and as fluctuations in sales of wireless test products were the principal cause of the fluctuation in our consolidated gross margin 
additional factors affecting our gross margins include changes in the costs of materials and labor  changes in cost estimates for contracts for which revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis  variations in overhead absorption rates and other manufacturing efficiencies  and numerous other factors 
to continue to improve our gross margins  we seek to introduce products that are valued by our customers for the ability of those products to address technically challenging applications where performance and reliability are the highest priorities 
we also seek continuously to reduce our costs and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  such as with the restructuring activities we have taken during the last several years 
selling  general administrative costs our selling  general and administrative costs consist of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products as well as administrative overhead costs 
changes in selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of sales have historically been modest as we have continually focused on controlling our costs 
our selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales have increased from to over the last three fiscal years  due mainly to a reduction in sales 
to help reduce the adverse impact on profitability resulting from the worldwide economic downturn that continues to impact the global economy and in response to our recent downturn in sales  we have selectively adjusted salaries over the last few years and suspended the match to our k plan since fiscal additionally  personnel reductions were carried out in fiscal and fiscal  in both of our segments  to reduce costs in response to market conditions 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs related to direct product design  development and process engineering 
the level of research and development expense is related to the number of products in development  the state of the development process  the complexity of the underlying technology  the potential scale of the product upon successful commercialization  the level of our exploratory research and the extent to which product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements 
we generally conduct such activities in collaboration with our customers  which provide better visibility into areas we believe will accelerate our longer term sales growth 
our basic technologies have been developed through a combination of internal development  acquisitions of businesses with technologies in similar or adjacent fields and  more recently  through licenses 
our more recent acquisitions have been of a tuck in nature  demonstrative of a business philosophy that is not hesitant to acquire a business when it is more cost efficient to buy technology than to develop it 
licenses have primarily been used to access technology geared to a commercial application that we can translate to a radiation hardened application for use in space 
acquisitions  restructurings and impairments we have a more than twenty year history of acquiring businesses 
as noted above  more recent acquisitions have been smaller  more tuck in transactions 
in august  we were acquired and taken private 
the application of purchase accounting is  therefore  pervasive throughout our consolidated financial statements  most notably in the balance sheets amortizable and non amortizable intangible asset and goodwill accounts and in the operating statements amortization of intangibles 
acquired businesses often require restructuring activities to better align their on going operations with those of our company and to improve their profitability 
the majority of the restructuring charges contained in our consolidated financial statements relate to activities taken to consolidate our acquired european manufacturing operations and consolidate certain of our us facilities 
for instance in the aeroflex microelectronic solutions ams segment  we implemented a plan in to move the integrated product line in our whippany  new jersey  factory to our then recently acquired facility in eatontown  new jersey 
these actions  which were completed in fiscal  better aligned our manufacturing operations and enabled us to close and  in fiscal  to sell our whippany facility 
in the aeroflex test solutions ats segment  we reorganized and integrated willtek a company we acquired in may into our existing uk operations 
these activities began with the elimination of redundant personnel in fiscal and were completed in fiscal when willtek s manufacturing was moved from germany to our uk manufacturing facility 
additionally  in response to substantially lower than expected sales in fiscal  we reduced ats headcount in europe within our wireless test business 
we continued our integration efforts during fiscal in our european operations by consolidating our sales operation in france to the uk restructuring activities in fiscal also included the consolidation within our avcomm group of our cupertino  california facility into our wichita  kansas facility  the discontinuance of a product line and the establishment of an engineering facility in sunnyvale  california that will service all of our ats operations 
these restructuring activities are not expected to significantly reduce sales 
production costs will be reduced due to personnel cuts and a reduction in facility costs 
these units are not significant to the ats business and therefore the resulting increase in operating income will likewise not be significant to the company as a whole 
for the fiscal year ended june   restructuring charges consisted of severance costs of million  which resulted in reductions in personnel at various locations worldwide  primarily at our ats operations and facility closure costs of million 
for the fiscal year ended june   restructuring charges consisted of severance costs of million  facility closure costs of million and other non cash charges of million  primarily related to the continued integration of willtek into our european operations and the continued consolidation of one of our domestic ams facilities located in whippany  new jersey into two of our other facilities 
for the fiscal year ended june   restructuring charges consisted of i severance costs of million and facility closure costs of million  primarily related to the integration of willtek into our european operations and the consolidation of one of our domestic ams facilities located in whippany  new jersey into two of our other facilities and ii a non cash building impairment charge of million  based on the fair value of the whippany  new jersey facility that we subsequently sold in january interest expense in connection with the going private transaction  we incurred million of debt to finance the acquisition of aeroflex 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in december  we used the majority of the net proceeds from our ipo to repurchase an aggregate of million of our senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loans 
in may  we borrowed million  under the senior secured term loan of our senior secured credit facility at the adjusted libor  which had a floor of  plus a margin of prior to the amendments as described below  and repaid million of our then existing debt  including million of debt bearing interest at per annum 
on may   we amended our senior secured credit facility  which allowed us to increase the flexibility under the total leverage ratio covenant 
as a result of the amendment  the applicable libor interest margin increased from basis points to basis points 
on may   we further amended our senior secured credit facility 
the amendment eliminated the total leverage ratio covenant from the term loan portion of the facility  reduced the effective interest rate payable with respect to outstanding loans under the facility by basis points and extended the maturity date by eighteen months to november  these transactions  as well as the amount of debt repayments made in the normal course of business over the last few years  including approximately million of prepayments in fiscal and million in fiscal  have significantly reduced the amount of debt outstanding to million at june  as discussed above  the rates at which we borrow have also changed as a result of these transactions 
as a result  interest expense amounted to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal income taxes as a multi national company  we are subject to income taxes in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
as earnings from our foreign operations are repatriated to the us  we are subject to us income taxes on those amounts 
our tax provision may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to changes in jurisdictions where income is earned 
in addition  our tax provision may be impacted by an enacted change in tax rates and or availability of tax credits and incentives

the balance relates to reduced government spending on defense and space programs 
net sales in the ats segment decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily attributable to volume driven reductions of million in radio test sets  primarily related to a reduction in grmats sales to the us military  which did not repeat in fiscal  along with volume driven reductions in various other avcomm product lines primarily due to reduced government spending 
these reductions in sales were partially offset by an increase in wireless test product sales of million  resulting from increased sales of wireless test products in nearly all regions 
gross profit 
gross profit equals net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes materials  direct labor  amortization of capitalized software development costs and overhead expenses such as engineering labor  fringe benefits  depreciation  allocable occupancy costs and manufacturing supplies

the decrease in gross margin is principally attributable to the reduction in hirel microelectronics sales  which carry a higher gross margin than the segment average 
gross margin in the ats segment was for the fiscal year ended june  and for the fiscal year ended june  due to product mix 
the gross margin increased primarily due to the increased wireless test product sales which carry a higher gross margin than the segment average  combined with the decreased grmats sales  which carried a lower gross margin than the segment average 
gross profit increased million for the fiscal year ended june  from the fiscal year june  largely due to the increase in sales volume of wireless test products

in the ats segment  sg a costs decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in labor and employee related expenses  largely related to headcount reductions implemented by our ats wireless business during the latter part of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  actions taken to restructure our ats avcomm group during the latter part of fiscal research and development costs 
research and development costs include materials  engineering labor and allocated overhead

on a consolidated basis  restructuring charges were million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the restructuring charges were primarily related to cost savings initiatives which resulted in reductions in personnel at various locations worldwide  primarily at our ats wireless operations in europe and asia and our ats avcomm operations in the united states 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
continuing efforts throughout the first three quarters of fiscal at the avcomm reporting unit failed to increase sales in existing markets or penetrate new markets 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal  we commenced restructuring activities at the avcomm reporting unit 
in our annual impairment test of goodwill  the avcomm reporting group  due to a reduced forecast of earnings resulting from uncertainty regarding government spending and reduced commercial spending  recognized a million non cash goodwill impairment charge in fiscal we also evaluated the fair value of the radio frequency microwave  or rfmw  group tradenames 
the carrying value of the tradenames was higher than the fair value determined 
therefore  we recorded an additional non cash impairment of  in fiscal also in fiscal  we entered into a contract for the sale of our ams rfmw whippany  nj building 
the net proceeds received were less than the carrying value of the building 
therefore  we recorded a million impairment to the asset held for sale 
total impairment charges amounted to million in fiscal in fiscal  due to a decline in the rfmw reporting unit s forecasted operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal and beyond  we recorded non cash impairment charges to goodwill and other long lived assets related to the rfmw reporting unit of million and million  respectively 
itar settlement expense 
to administratively settle certain outstanding violations during the period from to of the arms export controls act and the international traffic in arms regulations that we had voluntarily disclosed to the state department  we entered into a consent agreement effectively as of august   that involves  among other things  a fine of million payable without interest over a two year period  million of which will be suspended and eligible for credit based on qualified pre and post consent agreement remedial and other compliance expenditures and investments made by us and approved by the state department 
during the quarter ended march   we recorded a charge of million representing the legal obligation to the state department under the then proposed terms of the consent agreement 
going forward  the resolution of this issue will not impact our ability to transact business internationally 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  interest expense increased as a result of the basis point increase in our interest rate on may   partially offset by i a lower outstanding principal amount due to debt reductions of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and ii a basis point interest rate reduction in connection with the may  amendment to our senior secured credit facility 
based on our current debt level and current prevailing interest rates  we expect interest expense to be approximately million in fiscal other income expense

we recorded an income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  of million on a pre tax loss of million resulting in an effective tax rate of 
in fiscal  we had a pre tax loss in the us and taxable income from foreign operations 
the us loss was largely the result of goodwill and other long lived impairment charges of million  of which million is non deductible 
in addition  we recorded a non recurring non deductible charge of million in connection with a settlement of itar related claims 
in fiscal  we reported pre tax losses in the us and foreign operations 
the us loss in fiscal was largely attributable to goodwill and other long lived impairment charges of million  which are largely non deductible 
the effective tax rate for both periods differed from the amount computed by applying the us federal income tax rate to income before taxes primarily due to foreign  state and local income taxes  including us income tax on certain foreign net income that we anticipate will be repatriated to the us  the r d credit and non deductible items  such as the impairment charges and itar penalty 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
although the company has a history of domestic pre tax losses in recent years  these losses are largely driven by amortization expense and impairment charges recorded in the financial statements relating to the us operations which are not deductible for us income tax purposes 
the amount of non deductible us book amortization expense recorded in fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  the company expects to report taxable income on its us federal income tax return and the majority of its state income tax filings 
in the fiscal years ended june  and  we paid income taxes of million and million and received refunds of million and  respectively  related to federal  state and foreign income taxes 
net income loss 
net income loss was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to impairment charges of million and million  respectively  and amortization of acquired intangibles of million and million  respectively

net sales fiscal year of of ended consolidated consolidated june  ams net sales ats net sales total in thousands  except percentages net sales in the ams segment decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  this sales decrease was primarily attributable to volume driven reductions in i sales of rf and microwave components primarily related to what we believe is a slowdown in the telecom broadband market  ii sales of frequency synthesizers due to timing of customer orders  iii sales of hirel microelectronics semiconductors primarily due to program delays  combined with government budgetary constraints on defense and space programs  and iv sales of motion control products primarily due to a delay in funding which pushed back sales for various programs 
these reductions were offset by a volume driven increase of million of mixed signal digital asics 
net sales in the ats segment decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in sales of wireless test equipment and a million reduction in sales of general purpose test equipment  primarily due to capital equipment freezes put in place by our customers in the latter part of calendar year coincident with a slower than anticipated roll out of g lte technology  particularly at certain of our larger handset customers and  to a lesser extent  pricing pressure 
the decrease in sales was partially offset by an increase in sales of radio test sets of million  which primarily relates to shipments of our grmats product

gross margin in the ats segment was for the fiscal year ended june  and for the fiscal year ended june  gross profit decreased million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in gross margin was caused primarily by the reduction in wireless sales  which carry margins greater than the ats segment average  and the increased sales of the grmats products in the fiscal year ended june  which were sold at margins below the ats segment average 
selling  general and administrative costs 
on a consolidated basis  sg a costs were relatively flat when comparing fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of sales  however  sg a costs increased from to from the fiscal year ended june  to the fiscal year ended june   due to the million unanticipated reduction in sales 
on a percentage basis to sales  sg a costs increased in both the ams and ats segments as most of our costs are fixed in the short term 
in fiscal  actions were taken to respond to the decline in sales 
concerning sg a  the impact of a salary freeze and the suspension of the k match initiated at the beginning of fiscal  combined with the savings realized from headcount reductions  lower sales commissions and bonuses served to control and reduce costs in fiscal by approximately million  however  the savings were offset by a number of items  most notably i a million increase in medical costs  ii a million increase in litigation and settlement costs related to several litigation matters  and iii a million increase in non cash compensation related to equity awards under the company s equity plan 
the majority of the headcount reductions were initiated during the second half of fiscal when the manufacturing operations by an acquired wireless business willtek were integrated into our existing uk wireless manufacturing facility

in both periods  the costs related primarily to the consolidation of our components operations by relocating a portion of our whippany  new jersey facility s production to our ann arbor  michigan facility and a portion to our eatontown  new jersey facility 
in connection with this consolidation  in the fiscal year ended june   we recorded a million impairment charge based on the fair value of the whippany  new jersey facility that we subsequently sold in january the ats segment incurred restructuring costs of million for the fiscal year ended june   primarily related to cost savings initiatives which resulted in reductions in personnel at various locations worldwide  most notably in connection with integration of willtek s manufacturing operations in germany into our uk facility 
in comparison  for the fiscal year ended june   the ats segment incurred restructuring costs of million  primarily related to the reduction of willtek s workforce in germany

there were no similar impairment charges recorded in the fiscal year ended june  change in fair value of acquisition contingent liability 
in the fiscal year ended june  we recognized a net benefit of million related to the decrease in fair value of the acquisition contingent consideration liability due to the former owners of rad  acquired in june  due to slower than anticipated roll out of new products  which has changed the future projection of sales during the earn out period 
in the fiscal year ended june  we recognized an expense of million  primarily related to an increase in the contingent consideration liability

during the fiscal year ended june  we incurred a million loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs  which was comprised primarily of million in tender premiums paid on the debt repurchased and million for the write off of the related deferred financing costs 
during the fiscal year ended june   we wrote off million of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of million of debt 
gain from a bargain purchase of a business 
during the fiscal year ended june  we recognized a  gain on the willtek bargain purchase  acquired in june  related to the final working capital adjustment to the purchase price 
other income expense 
other income expense of million for the fiscal year ended june  consisted of  of foreign currency transaction losses and  of miscellaneous expense  net 
other income expense of  for the fiscal year ended june  consisted of a  other than temporary impairment recorded on our auction rate securities and  of foreign currency transactions losses offset by  of interest income and miscellaneous income  net 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit was million for the fiscal year ended june  on a pre tax loss of million resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the reported tax benefit was less than the statutory rate due to a goodwill and intangible impairment charge of million in the us that was mostly non deductible 
another significant item impacting the effective tax rate for fiscal was the benefit from the reversal of the contingent consideration of million that was not taxable 
we recorded an income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  of million on a pre tax loss of million resulting in an effective tax rate of 
in fiscal  we had a pre tax loss in the us and taxable income from foreign operations 
the us loss was primarily due to expenses associated with our debt interest expense  loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs and for the termination of the sponsor advisory agreement 
the effective tax rate for both periods differed from the amount computed by applying the us federal income tax rate to income before taxes primarily due to foreign  state and local income taxes  including us income tax on certain foreign net income that we anticipate will be repatriated to the u 
s  the r d credit and non deductible and other non taxable items 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
based on the significant balance of deferred tax liabilities associated with our intangible assets that are scheduled to reverse over the next several years  we did not record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated in fiscal with respect to our us net operating loss carryforwards 
although the company has a history of domestic pre tax losses in recent years  these losses are largely driven by amortization expense recorded in the financial statements relating to the us operations which are not deductible for us income tax purposes 
the amount of non deductible us book amortization expense recorded in fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  the company incurred unusual charges of million in connection with the termination of the sponsor advisory agreement and million in connection with the refinancing of its debt that resulted in a taxable loss for which a deferred tax asset was recorded for the net operating loss carryforwards 
the domestic loss reported in fiscal was largely the result of an impairment charge of million  of which million is non deductible 
in addition  the company repatriated million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary during the year for which us tax was previously provided 
the combination of non deductible amortization expense  the non deductible impairment charge and repatriated earnings resulted in the company generating sufficient us taxable income in to fully utilize its federal net operating loss carryforward from at june   we had provided us deferred taxes of million on the accumulated earnings of one foreign subsidiary based on the company s intent to repatriate these earnings 
part of these earnings were repatriated to the us during fiscal which was used to pay down principal on the company s outstanding debt 
during fiscal  we also provided us deferred taxes of million on the accumulated earnings of this subsidiary and two additional foreign subsidiaries for which the company intends to repatriate the earnings in the foreseeable future 
at june   the company had approximately million of us deferred taxes provided for the expectation of the repatriation of these earnings 
aside from these three subsidiaries  the company did not have any significant overseas earnings for which us taxes have not been provided 
in the fiscal years ended june  and  we paid income taxes of million and million and received refunds of  and million  respectively related to federal  state and foreign income taxes 
net income loss 
net income loss was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and our current ratio was to  versus million  million and to  respectively  at june  our principal liquidity requirements are to service our debt and interest and meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
during fiscal  we made voluntary prepayments of million of our senior secured term loan facility with cash on hand at june  and cash generated from operations during fiscal on may   we amended our senior secured credit facility 
the amendment eliminated the total leverage ratio covenant from the term loan portion of the facility  reduced the effective interest rate payable with respect to the outstanding loans under the facility by basis points and extended the maturity date by eighteen months to november additionally  at june   we were able to borrow million under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility  of which none was outstanding 
as of june   we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our debt agreement 
certain loan covenants are based on adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda net income loss before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted to add back or subtract certain non cash  non recurring and other items  as required by various covenants in our debt agreement 
our use of the term adjusted ebitda may vary from others in our industry 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of operating income loss  performance or liquidity under us gaap and are subject to important limitations 
a reconciliation of net income loss  which is a us gaap measure of our operating results  to adjusted ebitda  as defined in our debt agreement  is as follows year ended june  in thousands net income loss    interest expense    provision benefit for income taxes   depreciation and amortization    ebitda    restructuring related costs  including pro forma savings a  impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  itar settlement expense  termination of sponsor advisory agreement  change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration liability share based compensation    special accounts receivable reserve  merger related expense  loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs    gain from a bargain purchase of a business other defined items b    adjusted ebitda    a primarily reflects costs associated with the reorganization of our european operations and consolidation of certain of our us operations  including non cash charges related to discontinued products of million in fiscal presented in cost of sales 
pro forma savings reflect the costs that we estimate would have been eliminated during the fiscal year in which a restructuring occurred had the restructuring occurred as of the first day of that fiscal year 
pro forma savings were estimated to be million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
b reflects other adjustments required in calculating our debt covenant compliance 
these other defined items include certain legal fees related to litigation  business acquisition costs and divestiture related costs during our fiscal year 
the financial covenant was eliminated from the term loan portion of our senior secured credit facility  when it was amended on may  the maximum leverage ratio of total debt less up to million of unrestricted cash to adjusted ebitda  as defined in our senior secured credit facility  as amended  is only in effect if as of the last day of the fiscal quarter there are any outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
the maximum leverage ratio permitted for the fiscal year ended june  was  whereas our actual leverage ratio was 
the maximum leverage ratio permitted periodically decreases as follows effective as of maximum the twelve months permitted ending leverage ratio september  june  september  december  june  september  march  september  as of june   there were no outstanding amounts under our senior secured revolving credit facility  therefore  the maximum leverage ratio covenant was not applicable 
we are  however  in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in the senior secured credit facility 
our senior secured credit facility contains restrictions on our activities  including but not limited to covenants that restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries  as defined in our senior secured credit facility  from incurring additional indebtedness and issuing disqualified stock or preferred stock  making certain investments or other restricted payments  paying dividends and making other distributions with respect to capital stock  or repurchasing  redeeming or retiring capital stock or subordinated debt  selling or otherwise disposing of assets  under certain circumstances  issuing or selling equity interests  creating liens on our assets  consolidating or merging with  or acquiring in excess of specified annual limitations  another business  or selling or disposing of all or substantially all of our assets  and entering into certain transactions with our affiliates 
if for any reason we fail to comply with the covenants in the senior secured credit facility  we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding debt 
if such a default were to occur  the lenders under the senior secured credit facility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable  and the lenders would not be obligated to continue to advance funds to us 
if the amounts outstanding under these debt agreements are accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the amounts owed 
we expect that cash generated from operating activities and availability under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility will be our principal sources of liquidity 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  to the extent we have consolidated excess cash flows  as defined in the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facility  we must use specified portions of the excess cash flows to prepay the senior secured credit facility 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or those future borrowings will be available under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness at maturity or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
cash flows for fiscal  our cash flow provided by operations was million 
our investing activities used cash of million  including capital expenditures of million 
our financing activities used cash of million  primarily for debt repayments of million that included million of voluntary prepayments and million paid to the lenders that did not remain in the facility when we amended it  partially offset by million of proceeds from term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility in connection with the may debt amendment 
for fiscal  our cash flow provided by operations was million  which included cash generated by reductions in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million due to concerted efforts made to better manage these items in fiscal our investing activities used cash of million  primarily for capital expenditures of million and earn out payments of million related to acquired businesses 
our financing activities used cash of million  primarily for debt repayments of million that included million of voluntary prepayments 
for fiscal  our cash flow used by operations was million  which included cash used to increase inventory by million in support of higher sales  to address longer lead times from suppliers and to reduce product delivery times to customers 
our investing activities used cash of million  primarily for payments for the purchase of businesses of million and for capital expenditures of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million 
our financing activities provided cash of million million of proceeds from term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and million from the ipo of our common stock  partially offset by the repurchase of senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loans  including premiums and fees  of million  debt repayments of million and debt financing costs of million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our capital expenditures primarily consist of equipment replacements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt and other obligations as of june  payments due by period in millions beyond total year years years years senior secured credit facility interest payments operating leases employment agreements total to the extent we have consolidated excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility  we must use specified portions of the excess cash flow to prepay the senior secured credit facility 
as of june  we were unable to reliably estimate these amounts for future years and therefore such amounts are not included in the table above 
we do not expect any future minimum sub lease rentals associated with operating lease commitments shown in the above table 
as of june   we were unable to reliably estimate when cash settlements  if any  with the taxing authorities may occur with our unrecognized tax benefits of million  therefore  such amounts are not included in the table above 
in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
none of these obligations are individually significant 
we do not expect that these commitments  as of june   will have a material adverse affect on our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have material current or future effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap 
we consolidate our subsidiaries  all of which  except for test evolution corporation  are wholly owned 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires that management of the company make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the more significant estimates included in our consolidated financial statements are revenue and cost recognition under long term contracts  the valuation of accounts receivable  inventories  investments and deferred tax assets  the depreciable lives of fixed assets and useful lives of amortizable intangible assets  the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  the recoverability of long lived amortizable intangible assets  tradenames and goodwill  share based compensation  restructuring charges  asset retirement obligations  fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities and certain accrued expenses and contingencies 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in the business climate  therefore  actual results may differ from those estimates 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other when estimating contingent liabilities  the low end of the range is accrued 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant them 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of trade discounts and allowances  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred or the services have been performed  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of microelectronic products and test and measurement equipment 
for arrangements other than certain long term contracts  revenue including shipping and handling fees is recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer 
if title does not pass until the product reaches the customer s delivery site  recognition of the revenue is deferred until that time 
certain of our sales are to distributors  which have a right to return some portion of product within specified periods from delivery 
we generally recognize revenue on these sales at the time of shipment to the distributor  as the returns under these arrangements have historically been insignificant and can be reasonably estimated 
a provision for such estimated returns is recorded at the time revenues are recognized 
for transactions that include customer specified acceptance criteria  including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
long term contracts are accounted for by determining estimated contract profit rates and use of the percentage of completion method to recognize revenues and associated costs as work progresses 
we measure the extent of progress toward completion generally based upon one of the following methods based upon an assessment of which method most closely aligns to the underlying earnings process i the units of delivery method  ii the cost to cost method using the ratio of contract costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs at contract completion based upon engineering and production estimates  or iii the achievement of contractual milestones 
provisions for anticipated losses or revisions in estimated profits on contracts in process are recorded in the period in which such anticipated losses or revisions become evident 
where an arrangement includes only a software license  revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and title has been transferred to the customer or  in the case of electronic delivery of software  when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs 
we also evaluate whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection of the receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist for which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element 
when a customer purchases software together with post contract support  we allocate a portion of the fee to the post contract support for its fair value based on the contractual renewal rate 
post contract support fees are deferred in advance payments by customers and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets  and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the related contract 
service revenue is derived from extended warranties  customer support and training 
service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual term or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
for example  revenue from customer support contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual term  while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer 
in addition  the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  verifiable objective evidence of selling price  such as third party selling prices  or estimated selling price  in that order  to allocate non software revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements 
revenue is recognized on only those elements that meet the four criteria described above 
advance payments by customers and deferred revenue was comprised of i advance payments by customers primarily for the purchase of materials  ii deferred service and software support revenue  iii deferred warranty revenue  and iv deferred revenue related to multiple deliverable arrangements 
we generally sell non software service and extended warranty contracts on a standalone basis 
acquisition accounting we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations  whereby the total purchase price of an acquisition  including contingent consideration  is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
a gain is recorded if the purchase price is less than the fair value of net assets and liabilities 
the allocation of the purchase price is dependent upon certain valuations and other studies  which contain estimates and assumptions 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of tradenames 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
we assess goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently if certain events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segments 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available that segment management regularly reviews to assess operating results 
impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine if there is an impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  and ii if there is an impairment  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of its net identifiable assets with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions 
the assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing 
we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and  in certain instances  we engage third party valuation specialists to assist us in estimating fair values 
to determine fair value of the reporting unit  we use an income approach 
we use a market approach to assess the reasonableness of the results of the income approach 
under the income approach  we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method  estimating future cash flows of each reporting unit  as well as terminal value  and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows 
the key estimates and factors used in the income approach include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates and profit margins based on historical results and internal forecasts  terminal value and the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 
the compound annual growth rate of sales for the first years of our projections ranged between and as of june  and ranged between and as of june  the terminal growth rates were projected at after years as of june  and  which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth 
the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from to as of june  and to as of june  future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill 
changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment  including our stock performance on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations 
as of june   five reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of carrying value ranging from to 
one reporting unit  avcomm  had a fair value less than its carrying value  which resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
the impairment test for other intangible assets with indefinite lives encompasses determining a fair value and comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  impairment is recorded 
to determine the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we use an income approach  the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset 
determining the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives requires significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
long lived assets we review other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value  which is determined by discounting future cash flows 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of plant and equipment is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  on a straight line basis 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease  including anticipated renewals  or the estimated life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization 
where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction  we have recorded a valuation allowance against such asset 
we record uncertain tax position liabilities for federal  state  local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit 
the calculation of these tax liabilities requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and are a subjective significant estimate 
we classify interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes 
share based compensation the fair value of share based payments is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the related vesting periods 
share based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest and has therefore been reduced for estimated forfeitures at the time of the grant  with subsequent revisions for the differences between actual and the estimated forfeiture rates 
in addition  stock awards with performance conditions are dependent upon pre established annual financial performance targets 
the amount of expense recognized is adjusted to reflect achievement of targets and changed expectations of achieving future targets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its authoritative guidance related to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
under the revised guidance  entities testing their indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing further impairment testing 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired  a quantitative test is required 
this new guidance will become effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued guidance which improves the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this new guidance is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal with earlier adoption permitted  which should be applied prospectively 
adoption of this new guidance will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  including any outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we currently do not have interest rate swap agreements hedging this debt 
as of june   million was outstanding under the term loan portion of the senior secured credit facility  bearing interest at based on the adjusted libor rate  which consists of a floor of basis points  plus an applicable margin of basis points above the floor 
our outstanding debt balance is subject to variable interest rates dependent upon fluctuations of the libor rate 
based on the libor rate at june   which was  an increase of in interest rates would only result in a increase on the interest rate relating to our outstanding borrowings due to the libor floor  or a million increase in our annual interest expense 
an increase of in the libor rate above the floor would result in a million increase in our annual interest expense 
in addition  as of june   our revolving credit facility of million  which would bear interest at based on the libor rate of plus basis points  was undrawn 
assuming the entire amount available to us was outstanding  a change in interest rates would result in a  change in our annual interest expense 
any debt we incur in the future may also bear interest at floating rates 
foreign currency risk 
foreign currency contracts are used to protect us from exchange rate fluctuation from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until such currency is exchanged for us dollars 
we periodically enter into foreign currency contracts  which are not designated as hedges  and the change in the fair value is included in income currently within other income expense 
as of june   we had million of notional value foreign currency forward contracts maturing through july  notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities  but are used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts 
the fair value of these contracts at june  was a liability of  if foreign currency exchange rates primarily the british pound and the euro change by from the levels at june   the effect on our comprehensive income would be approximately million 
inflation risk 
inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition during the preceding three years
