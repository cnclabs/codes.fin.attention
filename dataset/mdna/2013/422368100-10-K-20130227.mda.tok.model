this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  judgment and assumptions 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
certain abbreviated key terms have the meanings defined elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview heartware is a medical device company that develops and manufactures miniaturized implantable heart pumps  or ventricular assist devices  to treat patients suffering from advanced heart failure 
the heartware ventricular assist system the heartware system  which includes a ventricular assist device vad  or blood pump  patient accessories and surgical tools  is designed to provide circulatory support for patients in the advanced stage of heart failure 
the core of the heartware system is a proprietary continuous flow blood pump  the hvad pump  which is a full output device capable of pumping up to liters of blood per minute 
the heartware system is designed to be implanted adjacent to the heart  avoiding the abdominal surgery generally required to implant similar devices 
in november  we received approval from the united states food and drug administration fda for the heartware ventricular assist system as a bridge to heart transplantation in patients with end stage heart failure 
the heartware system has been available in the european union since receiving ce marking in in may we received an expanded european label for long term use of the heartware system in all patients at risk of death from refractory  end stage heart failure 
the heartware system has been implanted in patients at over health care sites in countries 
recent key milestones in the development and commercialization of the heartware system include the following on november   we received approval from the united states food and drug administration fda for the heartware system as a bridge to heart transplantation in patients with end stage heart failure 
on august   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding shares of world heart corporation 
the acquisition expands our intellectual property and technology portfolio 
in may  we received an expanded european label for long term use of the heartware system in all patients at risk of death from refractory  end stage heart failure 
in may  results from our advance bridge to transplant clinical trial were published in the american heart association s journal circulation 
in may  we completed enrollment of our endurance destination therapy clinical trial 
beyond the heartware system  we are also evaluating our next generation device  the mvad pump 
the mvad pump is a development stage miniature ventricular assist device  less than one half the size of the hvad pump 
the mvad pump is based on the same proprietary impeller suspension technology used in the hvad pump  with its single moving part held in place through a combination of passive magnetic and hydrodynamic forces 
the mvad pump is designed to support the heart s full cardiac output  yet also has the capability for partial support 
on september   pre clinical data was presented at the th congress of the international society for rotary blood pumps isrbp  which demonstrated that the mvad pump attained the objectives for system performance  hemocompatability and biocompatibility in good laboratory practice glp animal studies  a precursor to human clinical trials 
the mvad pump is designed to be implantable by surgical techniques that are even less invasive than those required to implant the hvad pump 
we expect to commence clinical studies using the mvad system in 
table of contents we began generating revenue from our products in august and have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
we expect our losses to continue as we continue to develop commercial markets  expand our research and development into next generation products  including the mvad pump  and related accessories and support on going and new clinical trial activity 
we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of convertible notes and the issuance of shares of our common stock 
most recently  we issued convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of million pursuant to the terms of an indenture dated as of december  the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the convertible notes will mature on december   unless earlier repurchased or converted 
we are headquartered in framingham  massachusetts 
we have facilities in miami lakes  florida  sydney  australia and hannover  germany 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we are required to adopt various accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on our historical experience to the extent practicable and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made 
if our assumptions prove inaccurate or if our future results are not consistent with our historical experience  we may be required to make adjustments in our policies that affect our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the financial statements included in this report 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition  inventory capitalization and valuation  accounting for share based compensation  measurement of fair value  and the valuation of tax assets and liabilities 
we also have other key accounting policies that are less subjective and  therefore  their application is less subject to variations that would have a material impact on our reported results of operations 
the following is a discussion of our most critical policies  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with fasb asc revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to our customers  the selling price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured and there are no further obligations to customers 
sales from products are not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
we sell products through our direct sales force and through distributors 
sales through distributors are recognized as revenue upon sale to the distributor as these sales are considered to be final and no right of return or price protection exists 
sales to customers  when not made on consignment  are recognized upon shipment 
a significant portion of our sales  including all sales made to date through clinical trials in the us  are made on a consignment basis 
revenue from products sold on a consignment basis is recognized on the date the consigned product is implanted or otherwise consumed 
in limited circumstances  we rent peripheral equipment to patients 
we recognize revenue from this arrangement when a contract is entered into with the patient s insurer over the term the equipment is rented 
inventory we expense costs relating to the production of inventories as research and development r d expense in the period incurred until such time as we believe future commercialization is considered probable and future economic benefit is expected to be recognized  which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval 
we then begin to capitalize subsequent inventory costs relating to that product 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out  or fifo  method 
work in process and finished goods include direct and indirect labor and manufacturing overhead 
finished goods include product which is ready for use and which is held by us or by our customers on a consignment basis 

table of contents we review our inventory for excess or obsolete items and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
obsolescence may occur due to product expiring or product improvements rendering previous versions obsolete 
the extent to which product improvements will cause obsolescence of existing inventory is difficult to determine as the rate of customer acceptance is dependent on many factors 
we make judgments and estimates on matters  including forecasted sales volume 
our estimates and judgments in this area are subject to uncertainty and may differ from our actual experience in the future  which could have a material effect on recorded inventory values 
we include in inventory materials and finished goods that are held for sale 
certain materials and finished goods held in inventory may be used in research and development activities and are expensed as part of research and development costs when consumed 
share based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense in connection with our share based awards based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant  net of estimated forfeitures  using an accelerated accrual method over the vesting period 
therefore  we only recognize compensation cost for those awards expected to vest over the service period of the award 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience of forfeitures 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions  including forfeiture rates  estimates of expected life of the share based award  stock price volatility and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
we value restricted stock units  or rsu s  at their intrinsic value on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using a black scholes option pricing model 
when appropriate  we estimate the expected life of a stock option by averaging the contractual term of the stock option up to years with the associated vesting term typically years 
we estimate the volatility of our shares on the date of grant considering several factors  including the historical volatility of our publicly traded shares 
we estimate the risk free interest rate based on rates in effect for united states government bonds with terms similar to the expected lives of the stock options  at the time of grant 
we have issued share based awards with performance based vesting criteria 
achievement of the milestones must be probable before we begin recording share based compensation expense 
at each reporting period  we review the likelihood that these awards will vest and if the vesting is deemed probable  we begin to recognize compensation expense at that time 
in the period that achievement of the performance based criteria is deemed probable  us gaap requires the immediate recognition of all previously unrecognized compensation since the original grant date 
as a result  compensation expense recorded in the period that achievement is deemed probable could include a substantial amount of previously unrecorded compensation expense related to the prior periods 
if ultimately performance goals are not met  for any share based awards where vesting was previously deemed probable  previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
fair value measurements fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fasb asc requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments  whether or not recognized  for financial statement purposes 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to us as of the respective reporting dates 
accordingly  the estimates presented in our financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments 

table of contents fasb asc specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of financial instruments represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  the use of different estimates or assumptions would result in a higher or lower fair value and different amounts being recorded in our financial statements 
calculating fair value utilizing level inputs requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method presented by fasb asc income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of fasb asc through december   we have historically concluded that a full valuation allowance is required to offset our net deferred tax assets 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
fasb asc requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
reserves management must make estimates and assumptions to determine the amount of reserves to record in the financial statements 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  our consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from an inability to collect payments owed to us for product sales 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 

table of contents certain patient accessories sold with the heartware system are covered by a limited warranty ranging from one to two years 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded as an expense when the related revenue is recognized and are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
factors that affect estimated warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  cost per claim  and vendor supported warranty programs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
results of operations the following is a description of significant components of our operations  including significant trends and uncertainties that we believe are important to an understanding of our business and results of operations 
fiscal years and revenue  net in and  we generated revenue through clinical trials and commercial sales 
the increase in revenue from to is due to increased commercial market penetration outside of the us resulting in international revenue growth 
revenue from the commercial launch of the hvad system offset by a decrease in us clinical trial revenues led to a decrease in total us revenues 
net revenue for the years ended december  and was as follows change in thousands revenue  net our sales are made in multiple currencies including the euro 
during  our net revenue denominated in foreign currencies was million  an increase of million  or  compared to changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted total revenue by approximately million  or  for we expect to continue to generate and grow commercial revenue from product sales as we further expand our sales and marketing efforts on a global basis  including commercial sales in the us following our recent fda approval of the heartware system for bridge to transplant 
future product sales are dependent on many factors  including perception of product performance and market acceptance among physicians  patients  health care payers and the medical community as well as our capacity to meet customer demand by manufacturing sufficient quantities of our products 
cost of revenue cost of revenue includes costs associated with manufacturing and distributing our product and consists of direct materials  labor and overheard expenses allocated to the manufacturing process  provisions for excess or obsolete inventory  and shipping costs 
cost of revenue totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  
table of contents gross profit and gross margin percentage for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands gross profit gross margin the decrease in gross margin percentage for compared to is due primarily to an increase in manufacturing overhead costs per unit as a result of increased overhead costs including costs associated with larger production capabilities and an increase in certain inventory reserves 
our new miami lakes facility is expected to be approved to manufacture products for sale in the us in upon receipt of approval to manufacture in the new facility  we expect an increase in manufacturing overhead as the new facility is larger than our current facility and there may be a period of overlap when both facilities are operating 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with selling and marketing our products and the general corporate administration of the company 
these costs are primarily related to salaries and wages and related employee costs  travel  external consultants and contractors  legal and accounting fees and general infrastructure costs  and include all operating costs not associated with or otherwise classified as research and development costs or cost of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows change in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses of operating expenses during  we continued to experience significant growth as we expanded sales and distribution capabilities internationally and in the us later in in anticipation of commercially launching the heartware system after receiving fda approval 
we also experienced increased administrative costs as we expanded our administrative capabilities to support overall corporate growth 
the increase of million was a result of an increase in employee costs  including salaries and wages and related costs of approximately million and share based compensation of million  primarily due to increased headcount  and increases in consultant expenses of million  travel expenses of million  other taxes of million  insurance expenses of million and marketing expenses of million 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in compared to as we continue to expand our sales and distribution capabilities  in an effort to increase market penetration on a global basis  as well as our administrative capabilities to support our overall corporate growth 
we have and will continue to experience an increase in our employee headcount as well as an increase in costs associated with the necessary administrative infrastructure to support this expansion 
research and development research and development expenses are the direct and indirect costs associated with developing our products prior to commercialization  including the costs of operating clinical trials  and are expensed as incurred 
these expenses fluctuate based on project level activity and consist primarily of salaries and wages and related employee costs of our research and development  clinical and regulatory staff  external research and development costs  and materials and expenses associated with clinical trials 
additional costs include travel  facilities and overhead allocations 

table of contents change in thousands total research and development expenses of operating expenses the increase of million was due to an increase in costs associated with development projects of million  including million of outside engineering  million in consultants and contractors and million in consumables 
these costs were primarily related to furthering our product pipeline  including development of our next generation heart pump system  mvad  a fully implantable vad system  and continuous improvement on patient peripherals 
in addition  we also experienced an increase in our clinical trial costs of million  an increase in employee costs  including salaries and wages and related costs  of approximately million and an increase in share based compensation of million 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to represent a significant portion of our operating expenses for the foreseeable future related to product development and clinical trials as we continue to grow our product pipeline 
foreign exchange we generate a substantial portion of our revenue and collect receivables in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro  british pound and australian dollar can result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses that may significantly impact our financial results 
continued fluctuation of these exchange rates could result in financial results that are not comparable from quarter to quarter 
in  our net foreign exchange gains totaled approximately million compared to a million loss in in and  the majority of our realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses were experienced upon the collection of certain accounts receivable that were denominated in foreign currencies  and the translation to us dollars at period end of certain balance sheet accounts  denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
we expect to continue to realize foreign exchange gains and losses for the foreseeable future as the majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are settled in euros 
we do not currently utilize foreign currency contracts to manage foreign exchange risks 
interest expense interest expense in and primarily consists of interest incurred on the principal amount of our convertible senior notes issued in december  amortization of the related discount and amortization of the portion of the deferred financing costs allocated to the debt component 
the convertible senior notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
the discount on the convertible senior notes and the deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense through the december  maturity date of the convertible senior notes using the effective interest method 
interest expense was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
interest incurred on the principal amount of the convertible senior notes at the coupon rate was approximately million in and non cash amortization of the discount and deferred financing costs totaled approximately million and million in and  respectively 
as the convertible senior notes approach the december  maturity date  the amount of non cash amortization of the discount and deferred financing costs will continue to increase 
investment income  net investment income is primarily derived from investments and cash and short term deposit accounts held in the us the amortization of premium on our investments is also included in investment income  net 
investment income  net was approximately million in  compared to million in we had lower cash and investments balances during and have experienced lower interest rates compared to 
table of contents income taxes we are subject to taxation in the united states and jurisdictions outside of the united states 
these jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates 
in  income tax expense relates primarily to income earned by a foreign subsidiary 
foreign earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested in operations outside the us and as such we have not provided for us income taxes 
we have incurred significant us losses since inception  however  changes in issued capital and share ownership  as well as other factors  may limit our ability to utilize any net operating loss carry forwards  and therefore a valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we did not have ongoing profit which would be sufficient to allow any portion of our domestic or foreign deferred tax assets to be recorded 
we intend to monitor closely whether to record a deferred tax asset as we further expand the commercialization of our products 
fiscal years and revenue  net in and  we generated revenue from commercial sales outside of the us and sales in connection with our clinical trials in the us the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased market penetration outside of the us  increased activity in our us destination therapy study and continuing activity after completion of our us bridge to transplant study through a continued access protocol cap 
net revenue for the years ended december  and was as follows change in thousands revenue  net approximately of our product sales in were derived in the us as compared to in the increase in the portion of our revenue derived in the us is due primarily to the increased enrollment in our us destination therapy study 
during  our net revenue denominated in foreign currencies was million  an increase of million  or  compared to changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by approximately million  or for cost of revenue cost of revenue totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  gross profit and gross margin percentage for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands gross profit gross margin the gross margin percentage for increased compared to as a result of lower per unit costs in primarily due to improved leverage of manufacturing overhead resulting from increased production volume and improved efficiencies in our manufacturing processes 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows change in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses of operating expenses during  we continued to experience significant growth as we expanded european sales and distribution capabilities and increased the number of implants in the us under clinical trials 
we also experienced growth in administrative costs as we expanded our administrative capabilities to support overall corporate growth 
as a result  we experienced expansion of our staff  including senior management  and overall growth in selling and marketing and administrative functions and a related expansion in infrastructure costs 
the increase of million was a result of an increase in employee costs  including salaries and wages and related costs  of approximately million  primarily due to increased headcount 
we also experienced increases in office expenses of million  travel expenses of million  marketing expenses of million and legal costs of million 
the increase in legal costs includes million for the potential settlement of ongoing litigation as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
research and development research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows change in thousands total research and development expenses of operating expenses the increase of million was due to an increase in costs associated with development projects  including consumables  animal studies  outside engineering  consultants and contractors  of million  primarily related to mvad development

costs associated with our us clinical trials increased by million 
foreign exchange in  our net foreign exchange losses totaled approximately million compared to million in the increase in our net foreign exchange losses is primarily due to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the euro and us dollar during in and  the majority of our realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses were experienced upon the collection of certain accounts receivable that were denominated in foreign currencies  and the translation to us dollars at period end of certain balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
interest expense interest expense was approximately million and million in and  respectively

non cash amortization of the discount and deferred financing costs totaled approximately million and million in and  respectively 
investment income  net investment income is primarily derived from investments and cash and short term deposit accounts held in the us the amortization of premium on our investments is also included in investment income  net 
investment income  net was approximately million in  compared to million in while we had greater cash and investments balances during as a result of the issuance of our convertible senior notes in december  we have experienced lower interest rates in compared to 
table of contents income taxes as of december   we did not have ongoing profit which would be sufficient to allow any portion of our deferred tax assets to be recorded

table of contents cash provided by investing activities in  net cash provided by investing activities included million received upon maturity net of purchases of available for sale securities  million received upon the acquisition of world heart  million used to acquire property  plant and equipment  million used to acquire patents and million paid for a security deposit on a facility lease 
in  net cash used in investing activities included million for the purchase net of maturities of available for sale securities 
other investing activities in used cash of approximately million 
this included approximately million to acquire property  plant and equipment  primarily for the build out of our manufacturing facility located in miami lakes  florida 
in  cash used in investing activities included million for the purchase of available for sale securities  million to acquire property  plant and equipment and million of cash paid for a security deposit on a facility lease 
cash provided by financing activities in  and  we received approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the exercise of stock options 
in  cash provided by financing activities also included net cash proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes and an offering of our common stock 
in december  we issued convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million pursuant to the terms of an indenture dated as of december   and received net cash proceeds of approximately million 
the convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 
the convertible senior notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the convertible senior notes will mature on december   unless earlier repurchased by the company or converted 
the notes offering was completed pursuant to a prospectus supplement  dated december   to a shelf registration statement on form s that was previously filed with the sec and which was declared effective on december  this shelf registration statement allows us to offer and sell from time to time  in one or more series or issuances and on terms that we will determine at the time of the offering any combination and amount of the securities described in the prospectus contained in the registration statement 
in february  we closed a public offering  under a shelf registration on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission on december   of approximately million shares of our common stock at an offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we have incurred operating losses to date and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses as we expand our sales and marketing capabilities  develop new products and seek regulatory approvals for the heartware system in the us in  cash on hand is expected to primarily be used to fund our ongoing operations  including  expanding our sales and marketing capabilities on a global basis  growing market penetration particularly in us following fda approval of the heartware system  continued product development  including first human implants of the mvad pump  regulatory and other compliance functions  planned investments in infrastructure to support our growth  and general working capital 
we expect to experience increased cash requirements for inventory and other working capital requirements to support continued growth 
our convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
based on the outstanding principal amount of our convertible senior notes at december   the semi annual interest payments due on june and december  will be approximately million each 
these amounts are expected to be paid from cash on hand 

table of contents we believe cash on hand and investment balances as of december  are sufficient to support our planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
at december   approximately million of our cash on hand was held in foreign locations  including australia  germany and the united kingdom 
to date  the company has not had unremitted foreign earnings and has not incurred us federal and state income taxes related to repatriated earnings 
as our operations in our foreign subsidiaries grow  we may generate foreign earnings and repatriation of those earnings to the us could result in us incurring federal and state income taxes 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to maintain regulatory approvals  fund commercial expansion  and develop and obtain regulatory approvals for new products 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following commercial acceptance of our products  costs to manufacture our products  expenses required to operate multiple clinical trials  further product research and development for next generation products and peripherals and expanding indications for our products as well as efforts to sustain and implement incremental improvements to existing products  expanding our sales and marketing capabilities on a global basis  broadening our infrastructure in order to meet the needs of our growing operations  expenses related to funding and integrating strategic investments  acquisitions and collaborative arrangements  payment of the excise tax on gross revenue from the sale of our medical devices imposed by the patient protection and affordable care act  which will take effect in  payment of our convertible notes on maturity if not converted or refinanced  and complying with the requirements related to being a public company in both the united states and australia 
contractual obligations at december   our contractual financial obligations and commitments by due dates were as follows total less than year years years thereafter in thousands convertible senior notes operating lease obligations purchase obligations other total from time to time we invest in certain development stage entities in connection with research activities 
the above table does not reflect certain contingent milestone payments in connection with these arrangements as the amounts are indeterminate at this time 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is currently confined to interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents that are invested in highly liquid money market funds  short term time deposits  short term bank notes and short term commercial paper 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to generate reasonable income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
we do not presently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investment portfolio may decline  which could result in a loss if we choose or are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
our convertible senior notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued with a fixed interest rate of per annum 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we conduct business in foreign countries 
for us reporting purposes  we translate all assets and liabilities of our non us entities at the period end exchange rate and revenue and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the periods 
the net effect of these translation adjustments is shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a component of stockholders equity 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue and collect receivables in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against major foreign currencies  including the euro  british pound and australian dollar  can result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses that may significantly impact our financial results 
these foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses are presented as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
continued fluctuation of these exchange rates could result in financial results that are not comparable from quarter to quarter 
we do not currently utilize foreign currency contracts to mitigate the gains and losses generated by the re measurement of non functional currency assets and liabilities but do hold cash reserves in currencies in which those reserves are anticipated to be expended
