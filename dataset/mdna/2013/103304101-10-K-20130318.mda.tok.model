the risks associated with growth and acquisitions  including our ability to identify  acquire  develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
the risk that we may not receive gaming or other necessary licenses for new projects or that regulatory authorities may revoke  suspend  condition or limit our gaming or other licenses  impose substantial fines and take other adverse actions against any of our casino operations 
our inability to select the new joint venture partner for borgata and the possibility that a new operating agreement will be entered into with the new venture partner  which could result in changes to borgata ongoing operations 
the risk that we may be unable to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  including cost overruns on any particular project  as well as other capital expenditures through cash flow  borrowings under our credit facility or the borgata credit facility  as amended  and additional financings  which could jeopardize our expansion  development  investment and renovation efforts 
the risk that we or borgata may be unable to refinance our respective outstanding indebtedness as it comes due  or that if we or borgata do refinance  the terms are not favorable to us or them

all forward looking statements in this document are made as of the date hereof  based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
risk factors the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our securities  including our common stock  senior notes and senior subordinated notes  as well as borgata senior secured notes  could decline significantly  and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
we encourage investors to also review the risks and uncertainties relating to our business contained in part i  item  business important information regarding forward looking statements 
risks related to our business our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy 
consumer demand for entertainment and other amenities at casino hotel properties  such as ours  are particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities 
changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions  effects of the current decline in consumer confidence in the economy  including the current housing  employment and credit crisis  the impact of high energy and food costs  the increased cost of travel  the potential for continued bank failures  decreased disposable consumer income and wealth  or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer  thus imposing practical limits on pricing and negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  we have recently experienced one of the toughest economic periods in las vegas locals history 
the current housing crisis and economic slowdown in the united states has resulted in a significant decline in the amount of tourism and spending in las vegas 
similarly  weak economic conditions have also adversely affected tourism and spending in atlantic city  where borgata is located 
since our business model relies on consumer expenditures on entertainment  luxury and other discretionary items  continuation or deepening of the economic downturn will further adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
intense competition exists in the gaming industry  and we expect competition to continue to intensify 
the gaming industry is highly competitive for both customers and employees  including those at the management level 
we compete with numerous casinos and hotel casinos of varying quality and size in market areas where our properties are located 
we also compete with other non gaming resorts and vacation destinations  and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses  and could compete with any new forms of gaming that may be legalized in the future 
the casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size  quality of facilities  number of operations  brand identities  marketing and growth strategies  financial strength and capabilities  level of amenities  management talent and geographic diversity 
in most markets  we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas 
in some markets  we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas 
for example  the kansas star is located approximately miles north of the kansas oklahoma border and faces competition from established gaming facilities in kansas and oklahoma  including first council casino  native lights casino  and kaw southwind casino  which are located in newkirk oklahoma approximately miles south of the kansas star  in addition to potential expansion of gaming facilities in oklahoma 
the kansas star may face additional competition in the wichita  kansas metropolitan area 
the wyandotte nation of oklahoma has filed an application with the us department of interior to have certain land located in park city  kansas in the wichita metro area taken into trust by the us government and to permit gaming 
if successful  the wyandotte nation would be permitted to open a class ii gaming facility  and upon successful negotiation of a compact with the state of kansas would be permitted to open a class iii gaming facility 
in july  the wyandotte nation brought suit against the secretary of the us department of interior to compel the secretary to take the park city land into trust 
this litigation is ongoing 
in recent years  with fewer new markets opening for development  competition in existing markets has intensified 
we have invested in expanding existing facilities  developing new facilities  and acquiring established facilities in existing markets 
in addition  our competitors have also invested in expanding their existing facilities and developing new facilities 
this expansion of existing casino entertainment properties  the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our 
table of contents competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we compete  and this intense competition can be expected to continue 
for example  on may   a new property was opened in atlantic city which will compete with borgata for gaming customers 
in addition  competition may intensify if our competitors commit additional resources to aggressive pricing and promotional activities in order to attract customers 
if our competitors operate more successfully than we do  if they attract customers away from us as a result of aggressive pricing and promotion  if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees  if their properties are enhanced or expanded  if they operate in jurisdictions that give them operating advantages due to differences or changes in gaming regulations or taxes  or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct business  we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees 
in particular  the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  our business may be adversely impacted by the additional gaming and room capacity in states which may be competitive in the other markets where we operate or intend to operate 
several states are also considering enabling the development and operation of casinos or casino like operations in their jurisdictions 
for example  the expansion of casino gaming in or near the mid atlantic region from which borgata attracts and expects to attract most of its customers has had an adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in january  table game legislation was signed into pennsylvania law which allows up to table games at each of the twelve largest authorized casinos and up to table games at each of the remaining two smaller authorized casinos 
table games became operational at the existing casinos in the philadelphia region in mid july in addition  other states near new jersey  including new york and delaware  either have or are currently contemplating gaming legislation 
in january  delaware legalized table games  which became operational in june at all three delaware casinos 
convenience may be a more important factor than amenities for some customers  especially mid week and repeat customers 
these customers may prefer the convenience of a closer drive to a nearby casino rather than dealing with a longer drive to enjoy the amenities that borgata has to offer 
expansion of gaming facilities in pennsylvania and other nearby states therefore has resulted in fewer customer visits to borgata  which has adversely impacted borgata business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands 
expansion of native american gaming in areas located near our properties  or in areas in or near those from which we draw our customers  could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
for example  increased competition from federally recognized native american tribes near blue chip and sam town shreveport has had a negative impact on our results 
native american gaming facilities typically have a significant operating advantage over our properties due to lower gaming taxes  allowing those facilities to market more aggressively and to expand or update their facilities at an accelerated rate 
although we have expanded our facility at blue chip in an effort to be more competitive in this market  competing native american properties could continue to have an adverse impact on the operations of both blue chip and sam town shreveport 
we also compete to some extent with other forms of gaming on both a local and national level  including state sponsored lotteries  charitable gaming  on and off track wagering  internet gaming  and other forms of entertainment  including motion pictures  sporting events and other recreational activities 
it is possible that these secondary competitors could reduce the number of visitors to our facilities or the amount they are willing to wager  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or maintain our profitability and cash flows 
increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties  including updating slot machines to reflect changing technology  refurbishing public service areas periodically  replacing obsolete equipment on an ongoing basis and making other expenditures to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities 
because we are highly leveraged  after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures 
if we are unable to make such expenditures  our competitive position could be materially adversely affected 
the global financial crisis and decline in consumer spending may have an effect on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot accurately predict 
the significant economic distress affecting financial institutions has had  and may continue to have  far reaching adverse consequences across many industries  including the gaming industry 
volatility in the financial markets and the weakened global economy  together with the recent downgrade of the united states credit rating and ongoing european debt crisis  has contributed to the current uncertain economic climate 
the ongoing credit and liquidity crisis has greatly restricted the availability of capital and has caused the cost of capital if available to be much higher than it has traditionally been 
therefore  we have no assurance 
table of contents that we will have further access to credit or capital markets at desirable times or at rates that we would consider acceptable  and the lack of such funding could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  including our ability to refinance our or borgata indebtedness  our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and our ability or willingness to fund new development projects 
we are not able to predict the duration or severity of economic downturns or the resulting impact on the solvency or liquidity of our lenders 
if a large percentage of our lenders were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations to us  we may not have the liquidity under our credit facility to fund our current projects 
there is no certainty that our lenders will continue to remain solvent or fund their respective obligations under our credit facility 
if we were otherwise required to renegotiate or replace our credit facility  there is no assurance that we would be able to secure terms that are as favorable to us  if at all 
we may incur impairments to goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  or long lived assets 
in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs 
during the fourth quarter of  the company changed the date of its annual goodwill intangible assets impairment test dates to october prior to the fourth quarter of  the company performed annual impairment tests on its goodwill on april and october the change in the impairment test dates for all reporting units to october did not delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge  as the january and april tests were performed on their respective test dates during  and did not result in any impairment 
management believes that the new impairment test date is preferable because it is more closely aligned with the company annual financial planning process 
these financial plans are a key component utilized in the annual impairment testing process 
the change in the impairment test dates constitutes a change in accounting principle under asc  accounting for changes and error corrections  and had no impact on the company consolidated balance sheet  statement of operations or cash flows 
the company determined it was impracticable to objectively determine projected cash flows and related valuation estimates that would have been used as of each october for periods prior to october  without the use of hindsight 
as such  the company has prospectively applied the change in annual goodwill impairment testing date from october  the results of our annual scheduled impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets did not require us to record an impairment charge during the nine months ended september   however  in december  we reconsidered our commitment to complete the echelon project and concluded that we would not resume development 
on march   we sold the echelon site and related improvements on the site and received net proceeds of million 
in addition  in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we test long lived assets for impairment if a triggering event occurs 
during the three months ended march   we performed an interim impairment test on the trademark we recorded in connection with the valuation of borgata due to our consideration of a change in facts and circumstances surrounding an adverse change in the business climate in the atlantic city region 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment to the trademark 
the impairment test was performed due to our consideration of certain facts and circumstances surrounding an adverse change in the business climate in atlantic city 
we believe our actual results have been adversely impacted by increased regional competition  and that in addition  borgata projected future results could be further negatively impacted by a new property that formally opened in atlantic city  on may  we also believe the refinancing of borgata debt and recapitalization of its member equity contributed to the results of this impairment test 
having performed an initial interim impairment test related to the borgata trademark during the first quarter of  we have established the first quarter as its prospective annual impairment test date as well  and we performed an interim impairment test over the borgata trademark at january  our analyses consisted of a valuation of the borgata trademark  using the relief from royalty method 
the only significant changes in our assumptions from the initial fair valuation were revised revenue and profitability projections  reflecting the impact of the changed present and forecasted circumstances 
the impairment test consisted of a comparison of the fair value of trademark with its carrying amount 
as a result of the impairment test  we did not record any impairment in the first quarter of on august   we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at that time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the current economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas geographical area  nor did we predict the incremental amount of additional supply into the market 
the change in circumstances implies that the carrying amounts of the assets related to echelon may not be recoverable  therefore  we performed an impairment test of these assets during the years ended december  and the outcome of these evaluations resulted in no impairment of echelon assets  as the estimated weighted net undiscounted cash flows from the project exceeded the current carrying value of the assets of approximately billion at both december  and however  
table of contents during the three months ended december   we reconsidered our commitment to complete the echelon project and concluded we would not resume development 
on march   we sold the echelon site and related improvements on the site and received net proceeds of million 
based on the exploration of the viability of alternatives for the project  in the three months ended december   we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately billion based on the difference between the book value of the assets and the estimated realizable value of the assets 
we also recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to the sam town shreveport gaming license in connection with the annual impairment test 
during the year ended december   this property operating results were less than expected due to weaker than anticipated discretionary consumer spending and increased competition 
due to the circumstances regarding the final development plan of echelon  we reviewed our former investment in morgans lv investment llc morgans  a joint venture with morgans hotel group co  for impairment during the year ended december  considering the subsequent mutual termination of this joint venture  certain of our contributions  primarily related to the architectural and design plans  were ultimately not realizable and  as a result  we recorded an other than temporary non cash impairment charge of million during the year ended december  related to such costs 
in addition  during the year ended december   in conjunction with an amendment to the original dania agreement to settle the contingent payment prior to the satisfaction of the legal conditions  we recorded the remaining million of the million contingent liability as an additional cost of the acquisition by increasing goodwill 
we tested the goodwill for recoverability  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million during the year ended december  if our estimates of projected cash flows related to our assets are not achieved  we may be subject to a future impairment charge  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our partner in the holding company  the limited liability company that owns and operates borgata hotel casino and spa in atlantic city  new jersey  has divested its interest and we do not have the ability to select the new partner 
we own a controlling interest in the limited liability company that operates borgata 
mgm currently beneficially owns the other interest 
as a result of the new jersey department of gaming enforcement the njdge investigation of mgm relationship with its joint venture partner in macau  mgm entered into a settlement agreement with the njdge and the new jersey casino control commission the njccc under which mgm placed its ownership interest in borgata the mgm interest into a divestiture trust the divestiture trust  which was established for the purpose of selling the mgm interest to a third party 
on february   mgm announced that it had entered into an amendment with the njdge  effective february   pursuant to which mgm was allowed to reapply to the new jersey casino control commission for licensure in new jersey with the deadline to sell the mgm interest deferred pending the outcome of the licensure process 
we are the managing member of the limited liability company that operates borgata  and have been  and will continue to be responsible for the day to day operations of borgata  including the operations and improvement of the facility and business 
additionally  we hold a right of first refusal on any sale of the mgm interest in borgata 
however  if mgm efforts to be relicensed in new jersey fail and they are forced to sell the mgm interest  we believe we will need to expend managerial resources to effectuate the eventual sale of the mgm interest from the divestiture trust to a new partner  regardless of whether we exercise our right of first refusal 
other than exercising our right of first refusal  we generally do not have the ability to affect the selection of the potential new partner at borgata 
while we believe we will retain direct control of the operations of borgata  based on our current operating agreement  a new partner may want to negotiate greater rights or different terms 
if we agree to consider changes to the operating agreement  these negotiations may decrease our ability to directly control the facility and effectively manage our financial risk 
any new partner could have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals 
the ongoing operation of the facility could change if we agree to negotiate agreements with a new partner that contain terms that differ from our existing operating agreement 
in addition  the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  matures in august at the time of maturity  if borgata is unable to refinance its bank credit facility on favorable terms  additional credit support and or capital contributions in the form of equity may be necessary to fund the ongoing operations of borgata 
this additional credit and or equity may need to be contributed by us or a new partner  if any  or from both 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing in a timely manner  or at all  we may be unable to meet the operating cash flow needs of borgata  and our investment would be at risk 
moreover  if any new partner does not have the financial resources to meet its share of the obligations  or subsequently declares bankruptcy  we could be required to fund more than our share 

table of contents we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets  through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities 
for example  in november  we completed the peninsula acquisition  and in october  we completed the acquisition of ip 
in january  we completed the hotel construction project at blue chip 
we may also pursue expansion opportunities  including joint ventures  in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
the expansion of our operations  whether through acquisitions  development or internal growth  could divert management attention and could also cause us to incur substantial costs  including legal  professional and consulting fees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  acquire  develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for our new projects or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved 
ballot measures or other voter approved initiatives to allow gaming in jurisdictions where gaming  or certain types of gaming such as slots  was not previously permitted could be challenged  and  if such challenges are successful  these ballot measures or initiatives could be invalidated 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that there will not be similar or other challenges to legalized gaming in existing or current markets in which we may operate or have development plans  and successful challenges to legalized gaming could require us to abandon or substantially curtail our operations or development plans in those locations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will not face similar challenges and difficulties with respect to new development projects or expansion efforts that we may undertake  which could result in significant sunk costs that we may not be able to fully recoup or that otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our expansion and development opportunities  including the development costs associated with the kansas star facility  may face significant risks inherent in construction projects 
we regularly evaluate expansion  development  investment and renovation opportunities 
for example  we are undergoing further development of the kansas star facility  which entails significant risks 
this project and any other development projects we may undertake will be subject to many other risks inherent in the expansion or renovation of an existing enterprise or construction of a new enterprise  including unanticipated design  construction  regulatory  environmental and operating problems and lack of demand for our projects 
our current and future projects could also experience changes to plans and specifications including changes for the kansas star construction facility  some of which may require the approval of the kansas lottery commission  delays and significant cost increases  shortages of materials  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages for contractors and subcontractors  labor disputes or work stoppages  disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors  health and safety incidents and site accidents  engineering problems  including defective plans and specifications  poor performance or nonperformance by any of our joint venture partners or other third parties on whom we place reliance  changes in laws and regulations  or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations  applicable to gaming facilities  real estate development or construction projects  including by the kansas racing and gaming commission  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental  permitting  construction or geological problems  environmental issues  including the discovery of unknown environmental contamination  weather interference  floods  fires or other casualty losses  other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases  and failure to obtain necessary licenses  permits  entitlements or other governmental approvals 
the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of our construction projects  including the kansas star facility  or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of our construction projects  such as the kansas star facility  which could materially adversely affect our plan of operations  financial condition and ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
we have entered into a fixed price  or guaranteed maximum price  contract with a construction manager for the construction of 
table of contents the first phase of the kansas star facility  however there is no guarantee we will be able to do so with respect to construction of the final phase of the development 
as a result  we may be required to rely heavily on our in house development and construction team to manage construction costs and coordinate the work of the various trade contractors 
the lack of any fixed price contract with a construction manager or general contractor for construction of the final phase would put more of the risk of cost overruns on us 
if we are unable to manage costs or we are unable to raise additional capital required to complete the kansas star facility  we may not be able to complete the project  which may have an adverse impact on our business and prospects for growth 
in addition  actual costs and construction periods for any of our projects can differ significantly from initial expectations 
our initial project costs and construction periods are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared at inception of the project in consultation with architects and contractors 
many of these costs can increase over time as the project is built to completion 
we can provide no assurance that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets  or that any project will result in increased earnings to us 
significant delays  cost overruns  or failures of our projects to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the failure to obtain necessary government approvals in a timely manner  or at all  can adversely impact our various expansion  development  investment and renovation projects 
certain permits  licenses and approvals necessary for some of our current or anticipated projects have not yet been obtained 
the scope of the approvals required for expansion  development  investment or renovation projects can be extensive and may include gaming approvals  state and local land use permits and building and zoning permits 
unexpected changes or concessions required by local  state or federal regulatory authorities could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled openings of the facilities 
we may not obtain the necessary permits  licenses and approvals within the anticipated time frames  or at all 
in addition  although we design our projects to minimize disruption of our existing business operations  expansion and renovation projects require  from time to time  all or portions of affected existing operations to be closed or disrupted 
any significant disruption in operations of a property could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the development costs of the kansas star facility are estimates only  and actual development costs may be higher than expected 
we have developed our budgets based on our plans  which are subject to change 
we expect the total development cost of the kansas star facility to be approximately million  including the privilege fee  construction costs  land acquisition costs  development costs relating to a hotel which is being developed by a third party  costs of furniture  fixtures and equipment  pre opening expenses  initial cage cash  and other development costs 
while we believe that the overall budget for the development costs for the kansas star facility is reasonable  these development costs are only estimates and the actual development costs may be significantly higher than expected 
unforeseen or unexpected difficulties or delays during construction may also adversely impact the kansas star facility budget 
our inability to pay development costs as they are incurred will negatively affect our ability to complete the kansas star facility on time 
our lottery gaming facility management contract with the state of kansas contractually obligates us to open certain phases of our project by certain specified dates 
for example  with certain exceptions  our permanent gaming facility must be completed by january   and our entire construction project as set forth in the management contract must be completed no later than january  if we fail to meet these future completion dates  we would be in breach of the management contract 
if we breach our management contract  the state of kansas has certain remedies  up to and including cancellation of our contract  which if it occurred  would cause a material adverse impact with respect to our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if we are unable to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as other capital expenditures  through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and additional financings  our expansion  development  investment and renovation efforts will be jeopardized 
we intend to finance our current and future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as our other capital expenditures  primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  and equity or debt financings 
if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  or our other capital expenditures  we will have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing  delaying or abandoning planned expansion  development  investment and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  forgoing any future distribution of dividends  obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners  or modifying our credit facility 
these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

table of contents in the past few years there have been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital 
we anticipate that these disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that funding for any of our expansion projects would come from cash flows from operations and availability under our credit facility to the extent that availability exists under our credit facility  as applicable  after we meet our working capital needs 
if availability under our credit facility does not exist or we are otherwise unable to make sufficient borrowings thereunder  any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
as a result  if we are unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner  or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for projects  limit the scope of  or defer such projects  or cancel the projects altogether 
in the event that capital markets do not improve and we are unable to access capital with more favorable terms  additional equity and or credit support may be necessary to obtain construction financing for the remaining cost of the project 
risks related to the regulation of our industry we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  as well as federal  state and local laws affecting business in general  which may harm our business 
the ownership  management and operation of our gaming facilities are subject to extensive laws  regulations and ordinances which are administered by the nevada gaming commission and gaming control board  mississippi gaming commission  indiana gaming commission  illinois gaming board  new jersey casino control commission  iowa racing and gaming commission  the kansas lottery commission  the kansas racing and gaming commission  the louisiana state gaming control board  the louisiana state racing commission and various other federal  state and local government entities and agencies 
we are subject to regulations that apply specifically to the gaming industry and horse racetracks and casinos  in addition to regulations applicable to businesses generally 
a more detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is included in exhibit to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  if additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate  such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 
from time to time  various proposals are introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that  if enacted  could adversely affect the tax  regulatory  operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and our company 
to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our properties 
however  we can give no assurance that any additional licenses  permits and approvals that may be required will be given or that existing ones will be renewed or will not be revoked 
renewal is subject to  among other things  continued satisfaction of suitability requirements 
any failure to renew or maintain our licenses or to receive new licenses when necessary would have a material adverse effect on us 
gambling legislative or administrative changes in applicable legal requirements  including legislation to prohibit casino gaming  have been proposed in the past 
for example  in  the state of louisiana adopted a statute in connection with which votes were held locally where gaming operations were conducted and which  had the continuation of gaming been rejected by the voters  might have resulted in the termination of operations at the end of their current license terms 
during the local gaming referendums  lafayette parish voted to disallow gaming in the parish  whereas st 
landry parish  the site of our racino  voted in favor of gaming 
all parishes where riverboat gaming operations are currently conducted voted to continue riverboat gaming  but there can be no guarantee that similar referenda might not produce unfavorable results in the future 
proposals to amend or supplement the louisiana riverboat economic development and gaming control act and the pari mutuel act also are frequently introduced in the louisiana state legislature 
in the session  a representative from orleans parish introduced a proposal to repeal the authority of horse racetracks in calasieu parish the site of delta downs and st 
landry parish the site of our racino to conduct slot machine gaming at such horse racetracks and to repeal the special taxing districts created for such purposes 
if adopted  this proposal would have effectively prohibited us from operating the casino portion of our racino 
in addition  the louisiana legislature  from time to time  considers proposals to repeal the pari mutuel act 
the legislation permitting gaming in iowa authorizes the granting of licenses to qualified sponsoring organizations 
such qualified sponsoring organizations may operate the gambling structure itself  subject to satisfying necessary licensing requirements  or it may enter into an agreement with an operator to operate gambling on its behalf 
an operator must be approved and licensed by the iowa racing and gaming commission 
the dra  a not for profit corporation organized for the purpose of operating a pari mutuel greyhound racing facility in dubuque  iowa  first received a riverboat gaming license in and  pursuant to the amended dra operating agreement  has served as the qualified sponsoring organization of the diamond jo since march  the term of the amended dra operating agreement expires on december  the wcda  pursuant to the wcda operating agreement  serves as the qualified sponsoring organization of diamond jo worth 
the term of the wcda 
table of contents operating agreement expires on march   and is subject to automatic three year renewal periods 
if the amended dra operating agreement or wcda operating agreement were to terminate  or if the dra or wcda were to otherwise discontinue acting as our qualified sponsoring organization with respect to our operation of the diamond jo or diamond jo worth  respectively  and we were unable to obtain approval from the iowa racing and gaming commission to partner with an alternative qualified sponsoring organization as required by our gaming license  we would no longer be able to continue our diamond jo or diamond jo worth operations  which would materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
regulation of smoking each of new jersey and illinois has adopted laws that significantly restrict  or otherwise ban  smoking at our properties in those jurisdictions 
the new jersey and illinois laws that restrict smoking at casinos  and similar legislation in other jurisdictions in which we operate  could materially impact the results of operations of our properties in those jurisdictions 
on april   an ordinance in atlantic city became effective which extended smoking restrictions under the new jersey smoke free air act 
this ordinance mandated that casinos restrict smoking to designated areas of up to of the casino floor 
during april  atlantic city city council unanimously approved an amendment to the ordinance  banning smoking entirely on all casino gaming floors and casino simulcasting areas  but allowing smoking in separately exhausted  non gaming  smoking lounges 
the amendment to the ordinance became effective on october   however  on october   atlantic city city council voted to postpone the full smoking ban for at least one year due to  among other things  the weakened economy and increased competition in adjoining states 
the postponement of the full smoking ban became effective on november  in december  atlantic city city council announced that it would not consider a full smoking ban in casinos pending further review 
additionally  on july   a state statute in indiana will become effective that imposes a state wide smoking ban in specified businesses  buildings  public places and other articulated locations 
the statute specifically exempts riverboat casinos  and all other gaming facilities in indiana  from the smoking ban 
however  the statute allows local government to enact a more restrictive smoking ban than the state statute and also leaves in place any more restrictive local legislation that exists as of the effective date of the statute 
to date  neither michigan city nor laporte county  where blue chip is located  have enacted any ordinance or other law which would impose a smoking ban on blue chip 
regulation of directors  officers  key employees and partners our directors  officers  key employees and joint venture partners must meet approval standards of certain state regulatory authorities 
if state regulatory authorities were to find a person occupying any such position or a joint venture partner unsuitable  we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint venture partner may be required to dispose of their interest 
state regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors  officers  key employees or joint venture partners to ensure compliance with applicable standards 
certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions that we are party to also require the approval of some state regulatory authorities 
live racing regulations louisiana gaming regulations and our gaming license for the evangeline downs require that we  among other things  conduct a minimum of live racing days in a consecutive week period each year of live horse race meetings at the horse racetrack 
live racing days typically vary in number from year to year and are based on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the number of suitable race horses and the occurrence of severe weather 
if we fail to have the minimum number of racing days  our gaming license with respect to the racino may be canceled  and the casino will be required to cease operations 
any cessation of our operation would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
regulations affecting businesses in general in addition to gaming regulations  we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages  environmental matters  smoking  employees  currency transactions  taxation  zoning and building codes  and marketing and advertising 
such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future  or new laws and regulations could be enacted 
for example  nevada recently enacted legislation that eliminated  in most instances  and  for certain pre existing development projects  reduced  property tax breaks and retroactively eliminated certain sales tax exemptions offered as incentives to companies developing projects that meet certain environmental green standards 
as a result  we  along with other companies developing projects that meet such standards  may not realize the full tax benefits that were originally anticipated 

table of contents we are subject to extensive taxation policies  which may harm our business 
the federal government has  from time to time  considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future 
if such an increase were to be enacted  our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future to finance casino development projects could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees  in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
for example  in june  the illinois legislature passed certain amendments to the riverboat gambling act  which affected the tax rate at par a dice 
the legislation  which imposes an incremental tax on adjusted gross gaming revenues  was retroactive to july  as a result of this legislation  we were required to pay additional taxes  resulting in a million tax assessment in june we are subject to significant taxes and fees relating to our gaming operations  which are subject to increase at any time 
currently  in iowa  we are taxed at an effective rate of approximately of our adjusted gross receipts by the state of iowa  we pay the city of dubuque a fee equal to  per year and we pay a fee equal to and of adjusted gross receipts to the dra and wcda  respectively 
in addition  all iowa gaming licensees share equally in costs of the iowa racing and gaming commission and related entities to administer gaming in iowa  which is currently approximately million per year per facility 
currently  at evangeline downs  we are taxed at an effective rate of approximately of our adjusted gross slot revenue and pay to the louisiana state racing commission a fee of for each patron who enters the racino on live race days from the hours of pm to midnight  enters the racino during non racing season from the hours of noon to midnight thursday through monday  or enters any one of our otbs 
our amelia belle riverboat casino in louisiana pays an annual state gaming tax rate of of adjusted gross receipts 
additionally  abc has an agreement with the parish of st 
mary to permit the berthing of the riverboat casino in amelia  louisiana 
that agreement provides for percentage fees based on the level of net gaming revenue as follows the first million   to million   and greater than million  
the annual minimum fee due under the agreement is million 
the kansas star  pursuant to its management contract with the state of kansas pays total taxes of between and of gross gaming revenue  based on achievement of the following revenue levels on gross gaming revenue up to million  on amounts from million to million  and on amounts above million in gross gaming revenue 
ksc is also contractually obligated to pay its proportionate share of certain expenses incurred by the kansas lottery commission and the kansas racing and gaming commission  which are estimated to be approximately million on an annual basis 
nevada use tax refund claims on march   the nevada supreme court issued a decision in sparks nugget  inc vs 
the state of nevada department of taxation the department  holding that food purchased for subsequent use in the provision of complimentary and or employee meals was exempt from use tax 
as a result of this decision  refund claims were filed for use taxes paid  over the period november through may  on food purchased for subsequent use in complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties 
we estimate the refund to be in the range of million to million  including interest 
in  the department audited and denied our refund claim while simultaneously issuing a million sales tax deficiency assessment  plus interest of million 
we appealed both the denial of the refund claim as well as the deficiency assessment in a hearing before the nevada administrative law judge alj in september in april  the judge issued a split decision  granting a refund on employee meals and applying a sales tax measure on complimentary meals  however  the ruling barred retroactive application of the sales tax measure to all years in the refund claim period  effectively overturning the department deficiency assessment 
both we and the department appealed the decision to the nevada state tax commission the commission 
on august   the commission remanded the case back for a second administrative hearing  which was held on september   to allow for the introduction of additional supporting documentation 
the alj issued a decision on november   reversing her position on the employee meal refund claim while also affirming the denial of the complimentary meal refund  as well as the denial of a retroactive application of the sales tax measure to both employee and complimentary meals 
the alj decision was affirmed in a commission hearing on january  on february  we filed a petition for judicial review in clark county district court 
we received a split decision at our district court hearing on october  the district court judge judge affirmed the alj decision that sales tax was applicable to complimentary meals and reversed the decision on employee meals  concluding that such meals were exempt from sales tax 
the department has asserted that  although the statute of limitations prohibits their ability to collect incremental sales tax on complimentary meals  the statutes provide for an offset of the incremental sales tax against refunds due on employee meals 
as such  the department believes that it is not required to pay the employee meal refunds 
we are appealing the decision on complimentary meals to the nevada state supreme court and the department has appealed the decision on employee meals 
the judge did not issue a decision with respect to the refund claim offset  and pending the ultimate resolution of the appeal at the state supreme court  we expect the offset issue will either be addressed by the supreme court or remanded back to district court 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of our appeal to the state supreme court  we will not record any gain until a final  non appealable decision has been rendered 
on july  the department retracted its previous guidance requiring payment of sales tax  on complimentary and employee meals  for periods subsequent to february  the updated guidance defers the requirement to collect and remit sales tax  without interest or penalty  on complimentary and employee meals until the occurrence of a defined future event 
based on the department updated guidance  
table of contents we have not collected  remitted or accrued a liability for sales tax on complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties 
blue chip property taxes blue chip previously received a valuation notice from the county assessor indicating an unanticipated increase of nearly to its assessed property value as of january  in december  we received the property tax bill related to our tax assessment in the amount million  which we appealed 
in february  we received a notice of revaluation  reducing the initial tax assessment by approximately million 
since then  we have made the minimum required payment against provisional bills received in years through  all of which were based on the valuation notice 
during the year ended december   we reached settlements with the county assessor  reducing the annual valuation for years through based on these settlements  we revised our cumulative property tax accrual to reflect the retrospective effect of the revised valuations 
the impact of these revisions to the valuations resulted in a reduction of our property tax accrual of approximately million  which was cumulatively reversed through property tax expense during the year ended december  we received the tax assessment in january but have not received valuation notices or final tax rates for the years or the tax assessment increased the taxable property value approximately over the settlement valuation 
we have appealed the tax assessment and believe the assessments for the period from january  through december  could result in a total property tax obligation  net of previous payments  ranging between million and million 
we have accrued  net of the payment of the minimum requirements discussed above  approximately million for this property tax liability as of december   based on what we believe to be the most likely outcome within our range  once all valuations have been received and all tax rates have been finalized  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated amount accrued will approximate the actual amount billed 
the final tax assessment notices for the period january  through december   which have not been received as of december   could result in further adjustment to our estimated property tax liability at blue chip 
new jersey income taxes atlantic city casinos  including borgata  currently pay a effective tax rate on gross gaming revenues 
we also pay property taxes  sales and use taxes  payroll taxes  franchise taxes  room taxes  parking fees  various license fees  investigative fees and our proportionate share of regulatory costs 
our profitability depends on generating enough revenues to pay gaming taxes and other largely variable expenses  such as payroll and marketing  as well as largely fixed expenses  such as property taxes and interest expense 
borgata is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and therefore federal income taxes are the responsibility of its members 
casino partnerships in new jersey  however  are subject to state income taxes under the casino control act 
therefore  borgata is required to record new jersey state income taxes 
we cannot assure you that the state of new jersey will not enact legislation that increases gaming tax rates 
increase in taxation if there is any material increase in state and local taxes and fees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we own real property and are subject to extensive environmental regulation  which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities  and could affect our ability to develop  sell or rent our property or to borrow money where such property is required to be used as collateral 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  including those governing discharges to air and water  the generation  handling  management and disposal of petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes  and the health and safety of our employees 
permits may be required for our operations and these permits are subject to renewal  modification and  in some cases  revocation 
in addition  under environmental laws  ordinances or regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigation and removal or remediation of some kinds of hazardous substances or petroleum products on  under  or in its property  without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or caused  the presence of the contaminants  and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred 
additionally  as an owner or operator  we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage  personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination 
the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility 
the costs of investigation  remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial  and the presence of those substances  or the failure to remediate a property properly  may impair our ability to use our property 
in addition  as part of our business in worth county  iowa  we operate a gas station  which includes a number of underground storage tanks containing petroleum products 
the presence of  or failure to remediate properly  the substances may adversely affect 
table of contents the ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral 
additionally  the owner of a site may be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site 
we have reviewed environmental assessments  in some cases including soil and groundwater testing  relating to our currently owned and leased properties in dubuque  iowa  and other properties we may lease from the city of dubuque or other parties 
as a result  we have become aware that there is contamination present on some of these properties apparently due to past industrial activities 
additionally  the location of the kansas star is the site of several non operational oil wells  the remediation of which has been addressed in connection with the construction of the development project 
with respect to parcels we currently own or lease  we believe  based on the types and amount of contamination identified  the anticipated uses of the properties and the potential that the contamination  in some cases  may have migrated onto our properties from nearby properties  that any cost to clean up these properties will not result in a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 
we have also reviewed environmental assessments and are not aware of any environmental liabilities related to our properties at evangeline downs  diamond jo worth and amelia belle casino 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our earnings  cash flows or competitive position relating to existing environmental matters  but it is possible that future developments could lead to material costs of environmental compliance for us and that these costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
borgata is a participant in a multiemployer pension plan  and the plan has been certified in critical status by the fund actuary 
in connection with borgata collective bargaining agreement with the culinary and hotel workers union  local unite here  it participates in the unite here national retirement fund pension plan the fund 
on march   as a result of the extraordinary decline in the financial markets and downturn in the economy  the fund was certified in critical status by the fund actuary under the federal multiemployer plan funding laws pursuant to the pension protection act of the ppa 
in connection with the certification  the fund board of trustees has adopted a rehabilitation plan effective on april  the rehabilitation plan with the goal of enabling the fund to emerge from critical status by january  the rehabilitation plan provides for certain increases in employer contributions and  in some cases  a reduction in participant benefits 
on may   borgata agreed upon a schedule with local unite here pursuant to which it began making increased monthly contributions to the fund effective october  borgata current monthly pension contributions to the fund range from million to million  and its unfunded vested liability to the fund is million for the plan year beginning on january  a renewed economic decline could have a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of the fund  which may require borgata to make contributions in addition to those already contemplated 
any such increases in required contributions could adversely affect borgata results of operations 
additionally  in connection with borgata collective bargaining agreements with the local engineers union pension plan and the nj carpenters pension fund  it participates in other multiemployer pension plans that have been certified in critical status under the federal multiemployer plan funding laws pursuant to the ppa 
the boards of trustees of these plans have adopted rehabilitation plans and borgata is currently in discussions with the boards regarding its level of participation in the rehabilitation plans 
the impact of the rehabilitation plans is not expected to have a material adverse effect on borgata financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
borgata current monthly pension contributions to the funds associated with these plans is approximately less than million per month in the aggregate 
borgata aggregate unfunded vested liability to these funds is approximately million 
under applicable federal law  any employer contributing to a multiemployer pension plan that completely ceases participating in the plan while it is underfunded is subject to payment of such employer assessed share of the aggregate unfunded vested benefits of the plan 
in certain circumstances  an employer can also be assessed withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan 
based on an estimate provided by the fund in april  borgata has estimated that its pre tax withdrawal  assuming a hypothetical immediate and complete withdrawal from the fund  could be in excess of million 
in addition  borgata estimates the pre tax withdrawal liability for the other funds to which it contributes to be approximately million 
however  the exact amount of potential exposure could be higher or lower than the estimate  depending on  among other things  the nature and timing of any triggering events and the funded status of the fund  or other funds to which it contributes  at that time 
risks related to our properties we own facilities that are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions 
extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations  damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas 

table of contents for example  due to flooding of the mississippi river  the mississippi gaming commission ordered the nine casinos located in tunica  mississippi to close indefinitely to ensure the safety of visitors and employees 
accordingly  effective may   we closed sam town hotel and gambling hall in tunica 
we were able to reopen on may   however  sam town hotel and gambling hall suffered minor damage  and have reached a settlement with our insurer 
in addition  the amelia belle was negatively impacted by the opening of the morganza spillway  due to imminent threat of severe flooding 
in addition  certain of our properties have been forced to close due to hurricanes 
in august  treasure chest was closed for eight days including labor day weekend due to hurricane gustav 
in september  treasure chest was closed for two days as a result of hurricane ike and in the property was closed for days as a result of hurricane katrina 
delta downs was closed for six days in august due to hurricane gustav and seven days in september due to hurricane ike 
hurricane gustav forced the closure of evangeline downs for five days in and amelia belle was closed from august to may due to hurricane katrina 
in  delta downs suffered significant property damage as a result of hurricane rita and closed for days 
in september  borgata was closed for three days due to hurricane irene 
in october and november  borgata was closed for four days due to hurricane sandy 
moreover  blue chip  par a dice  sam town tunica  sam town tunica  sam town shreveport  treasure chest and borgata are each located in an area that has been identified by the director of the federal emergency management agency fema as a special flood hazard area  which  according to the fema statistics  has a chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation a year flood in any given year 
in addition to the risk of flooding and hurricanes  snowstorms and other adverse weather conditions may interrupt our operations  damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected area 
for example  during january and february  much of the country was impacted by some of the worst winter weather in decades  particularly in the midwest 
although our properties at blue chip and par a dice were not closed as a result  these storms made it very difficult for our customers to visit  and we believe such winter weather had a material and adverse impact on the results of our operations during such time 
additionally  february was the snowiest month ever recorded in atlantic city  which generally kept would be gamblers from traveling to borgata  contributing to a drop in borgata monthly revenues from january to february 
the winter season was the worst on record  and travel throughout the entire northeast was extremely difficult 
the residual impact from these record winter storms resulted in day trip visitations to atlantic city that were reduced or delayed as regional school calendars were extended in order to make up for prior school closures 
additionally  extreme heat and low precipitation levels in the latter half of the first six months of  particularly in the month of june  had an adverse impact on visitation and spending at borgata property 
if there is a prolonged disruption at borgata or any of our other properties due to natural disasters  terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
to maintain our gaming license for our evangeline downs racino  we must conduct a minimum of live racing days in a consecutive week period each year of live horse race meetings at the racetrack  and poor weather conditions may make it difficult for us to comply with this requirement 
while we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs and loss of revenue that we incur as a result of some extreme weather conditions  our coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect  if at all  on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions 
if any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted as a result of extreme weather in the future  or if extreme weather adversely impacts general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we are not ultimately successful in dismissing the action filed against treasure chest casino  we may potentially lose our ability to operate the treasure chest casino property and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds

on october   copeland filed a supervisory writ application with the first circuit court of appeal asking that the partial summary judgment be reversed 
treasure chest and guidry opposed the writ 
on february   the writ was denied leaving intact the partial summary judgment 
discovery is proceeding 
we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on treasure chest business  financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer 
in addition  our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future 
although we have all risk property insurance coverage for our operating properties  which covers damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire  natural disasters  acts of war  or terrorism  each policy has certain exclusions 
in addition  our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss 
our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty 
in addition  certain casualty events  such as labor strikes  nuclear events  acts of war  loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism  deterioration or corrosion  insect or animal damage and pollution  may not be covered at all under our policies 
therefore  certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses 
we also have builder risk insurance coverage for our development and expansion projects 
builder risk insurance provides coverage for projects during their construction for damage caused by a casualty loss 
in general  our builder risk coverage is subject to the same exclusions  risks and deficiencies as those described above for our all risk property coverage 
our level of builder risk insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty

according to the fema statistics  a special flood hazard area has a chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation a year flood in any given year 
over a year period  the risk of a year flood in a special flood hazard area is 
our level of flood insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major flood 
due to flooding of the mississippi river  sam town hotel and gambling hall was closed from may  until may  sam town hotel and gambling hall was damaged  and while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance  we have not settled on our claims  and this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 
we renew our insurance policies other than our builder risk insurance on an annual basis 
the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage 

table of contents our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage 
failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements 
we draw a significant percentage of our customers from certain geographic regions 
events adversely impacting the economy or these regions  including public health outbreaks and man made or natural disasters  may adversely impact our business 
the california  fremont and main street station draw a substantial portion of their customers from the hawaiian market 
for the year ended december   patrons from hawaii comprised of the room nights sold at the california  at fremont and at main street station 
decreases in discretionary consumer spending  as well as an increase in fuel costs or transportation prices  a decrease in airplane seat availability  or a deterioration of relations with tour and travel agents  particularly as they affect travel between the hawaiian market and our facilities  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our las vegas properties also draw a substantial number of customers from certain other specific geographic areas  including the southern california  arizona and las vegas local markets 
native american casinos in california and other parts of the united states have diverted some potential visitors away from nevada  which has had and could continue to have a negative effect on nevada gaming markets 
in addition  due to our significant concentration of properties in nevada  any man made or natural disasters in or around nevada  or the areas from which we draw customers to our las vegas properties  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
each of our properties located outside of nevada depends primarily on visitors from their respective surrounding regions and are subject to comparable risk 
additionally  the expansion of casino gaming in or near the mid atlantic region from which borgata attracts and expects to attract most of its customers could have a significant adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in  pennsylvania passed legislation allowing table games at certain casinos in the state  and other states near new jersey  including new york  delaware  connecticut  and maryland have or are currently contemplating gaming legislation 
the expansion of gaming facilities in nearby states will further increase competition and may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
borgata also competes with native american tribes in the northeast and mid atlantic region 
expansion of native american gaming could have an adverse effect on borgata business  results of operations and financial condition  as native american gaming facilities typically have a significant operating advantage over borgata due to lower gaming taxes  allowing those facilities to market more aggressively and to expand or update their facilities at an accelerated rate 
the strength and profitability of our business depends on consumer demand for hotel casino resorts in general and for the type of amenities our properties offer 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could harm our business 
the terrorist attacks of september   other terrorist activities in the united states and elsewhere  military conflicts in iraq  afghanistan and in the middle east  outbreaks of infectious disease and pandemics  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  among other things  have had negative impacts on travel and leisure expenditures 
in addition  other factors affecting travel and discretionary consumer spending  including general economic conditions  disposable consumer income  fears of further economic decline and reduced consumer confidence in the economy  may negatively impact our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which similar events and conditions may continue to affect us in the future 
an extended period of reduced discretionary spending and or disruptions or declines in tourism could significantly harm our operations 
furthermore  our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time  as a result of casualty  flooding  forces of nature  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failure  or extended or extraordinary maintenance  among other causes 
if there is a prolonged disruption at any of our properties due to natural disasters  terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the outbreak of public health threats at any of our properties or in the areas in which they are located  or the perception that such threats exist  including pandemic health threats  such as the avian influenza virus  sars  or the hn flu  among others  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
likewise  adverse economic conditions that affect the national or regional economies in which we operate  whether resulting from war  terrorist activities or other geopolitical conflict  weather  general or localized economic downturns or related events or other factors  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent that the airline industry is negatively impacted due to the effects of the economic recession and continued economic downturn  outbreak of war  public health threats  terrorist or similar activity  increased security restrictions or the public general reluctance to travel by air  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents energy price increases may adversely affect our cost of operations and our revenues 
our casino properties use significant amounts of electricity  natural gas and other forms of energy 
in addition  our hawaiian air charter operation uses a significant amount of jet fuel 
while no shortages of energy or fuel have been experienced to date  substantial increases in energy and fuel prices  including jet fuel prices  in the united states have  and may continue to  negatively affect our results of operations 
the extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases  of which the impact could be material 
in addition  energy and gasoline price increases could result in a decline of disposable income of potential customers  an increase in the cost of travel and a corresponding decrease in visitation and spending at our properties  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
borgata has an executory contract with a wholly owned subsidiary of a local utility company with terms that extend to june  years from the opening of the water club 
the utility company provides borgata with electricity and thermal energy hot water and chilled water 
obligations under the thermal energy executory contract contain both fixed fees and variable fees based upon usage rates 
the fixed fee components under the thermal energy executory contract were estimated at approximately million per annum at december  borgata is also obligated to purchase a certain portion of its electricity demand at essentially a fixed rate which is estimated at approximately million per annum 
electricity demand in excess of the commitment is subject to market rates based on borgata tariff class 
our facilities  including our riverboats and dockside facilities  are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure and regulatory compliance 
generally  all of our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time  as the result of casualty  forces of nature  mechanical failure  or extended or extraordinary maintenance  among other causes 
in addition  our gaming operations  including those conducted on riverboats or at dockside facilities could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions 
we currently conduct our treasure chest  par a dice  blue chip  sam town shreveport and amelia belle gaming operations on riverboats 
each of our riverboats must comply with united states coast guard uscg requirements as to boat design  on board facilities  equipment  personnel and safety 
each riverboat must hold a certificate of inspection for stabilization and flotation  and may also be subject to local zoning codes 
the uscg requirements establish design standards  set limits on the operation of the vessels and require individual licensing of all personnel involved with the operation of the vessels 
loss of a vessel certificate of inspection would preclude its use as a casino 
uscg regulations require a hull inspection for all riverboats at five year intervals 
under certain circumstances  alternative hull inspections may be approved 
the uscg may require that such hull inspections be conducted at a dry docking facility  and if so required  the cost of travel to and from such docking facility  as well as the time required for inspections of the affected riverboats  could be significant 
to date  the uscg has allowed in place underwater inspections of our riverboats twice every five years on alternate two and three year schedules 
the uscg may not continue to allow these types of inspections in the future 
the loss of a dockside casino or riverboat casino from service for any period of time could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
indiana and louisiana have adopted alternate inspection standards for riverboats in those states 
the standards require inspection by the american bureau shipping consulting absc 
absc inspection for our riverboats at blue chip  treasure chest and sam town shreveport commenced during the par a dice riverboat will remain inspected by the uscg for the foreseeable future 
absc imposes essentially the same design  personnel  safety  and hull inspection standards as the uscg 
therefore  the risks to our business associated with uscg inspection should not change by reason of inspection by absc 
failure of a vessel to meet the applicable uscg or absc standards would preclude its use as a casino 
uscg regulations also require us to prepare and follow certain security programs 
in  we implemented the american gaming association alternative security program at our riverboat casinos and dockside facilities 
the american gaming association alternative security program is specifically designed to address maritime security requirements at riverboat casinos and their respective dockside facilities 
only portions of those regulations will apply to our riverboats inspected by absc 
changes to these regulations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our hotels and casinos are located on leased property 
if we default on one or more leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected hotel and or casino 
we lease certain parcels of land on which the orleans  suncoast  treasure chest  sam town shreveport  ip and borgata hotel and gaming facility are located 
in addition  we lease other parcels of land on which portions of the california and the fremont are located 
as a ground lessee  we have the right to use the leased land  however  we do not retain fee ownership in the underlying land 
accordingly  with respect to the leased land  we will have no interest in the land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases 
moreover  since we do not completely control the land underlying the property  a landowner could take 
table of contents certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the long term leases 
while such interruption is unlikely  such events are beyond our control 
if the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time  then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected 
if we were to default on any one or more of these leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land  including the hotels and casinos 
this would have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities 
risks related to our indebtedness we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
we had total consolidated long term debt  including current maturities  of approximately billion at december   excluding debt held by mdfc and peninsula gaming 
if we pursue  or continue to pursue  any expansion  development  investment or renovation projects  we expect that our long term debt will substantially increase in connection with related capital expenditures 
this indebtedness could have important consequences  including difficulty in satisfying our obligations under our current indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limiting  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our debt instruments contain  and any future debt instruments likely will contain  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  including providing guarantees or credit support  incur liens securing indebtedness or other obligations  make certain investments  dispose of assets  make certain acquisitions  pay dividends or make distributions and make other restricted payments  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in any new businesses  and enter into transactions with our stockholders and our affiliates 
in addition to our debt instruments  our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  mdfc and peninsula gaming  each have a significant amount of indebtedness which contain restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on each company  including limitations on dividends  distributions and certain other restricted payments  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

our credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio  a total leverage ratio and a secured leverage ratio each as defined in the credit facility that adjust over the life of our credit facility 
we believe that we were in compliance with the credit facility covenants  including the minimum interest coverage ratio  the maximum permitted total leverage ratio and the maximum permitted secured leverage ratio 
however  in the event that we project that our future performance may result in our not being in compliance with these covenants  we could implement certain actions in an effort to minimize the possibility of a breach of the maximum permitted total leverage ratio  the maximum permitted secured leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage ratio covenants 
these actions may include  among others  reducing payroll  benefits and certain other operating costs  deferring or eliminating certain maintenance  expansion or other capital expenditures  reducing our outstanding indebtedness through repurchases or redemption  and or increasing cash by selling assets or issuing equity

borgata bank credit facility borgata has significant indebtedness  including the borgata bank credit facility  which could affect its ability to pay dividends to us 
while we received a one time distribution from borgata of approximately million in august in connection with borgata financing  any future distribution from borgata other than distributions to satisfy tax liabilities relating to income of borgata will be subject to the limitations on dividends  distributions and certain other restricted payments under borgata bank credit facility and the indenture governing borgata senior secured notes 
at december   the outstanding balance under the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  was million  which bore an interest rate of 
contractual availability under the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  at december  was million 
on december   mdfc entered into a second borgata credit facility amendment that i decreases the minimum consolidated ebitda as defined therein to million for fiscal quarters ending december  and thereafter  ii modifies the definition of consolidated ebitda to exclude certain losses  charges  and expenses  iii adjusts the calculation of consolidated ebitda such that for the fiscal quarter ending december  through the fiscal quarter ending september   consolidated ebitda will be computed by including the four fiscal quarters with the highest consolidated ebitda out of the most recently ended five fiscal quarters  iv reduces the aggregate commitments as defined therein to million  v modifies the use of proceeds covenant to provide that the proceeds of revolving loans can only be used to repurchase or redeem mdfc senior secured notes if  after giving affect thereto  the aggregate amount of outstanding loans and letters of credit under the borgata bank credit facility does not exceed million  and vi adds a covenant prohibiting mdfc and mddc from repurchasing or redeeming mdfc senior secured notes at any time unless consolidated ebitda was at least million for the most recently ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters prior thereto

the increase in our consolidated leverage and debt service obligations as a result of the peninsula acquisition  may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and earnings per share 
as a result of the peninsula acquisition  we now have a greater amount of debt on a consolidated basis than we have maintained in the past 
as of december   our indebtedness primarily consists of billion in principal outstanding under our credit facility and billion aggregate principal amount of our senior and senior subordinated notes  which are the obligations of boyd gaming  million in principal outstanding under peninsula credit facility and million aggregate principal amount of peninsula senior note  and million outstanding under the borgata bank credit facility and borgata million aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior secured notes which are the obligations of borgata 
our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 
our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  regulatory and other factors 
furthermore  our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt 
as a result  we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds 
if we determine that it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason  we may not be able to obtain such funding or  if funding is available  obtain it on acceptable terms 
if we fail to make a payment on our debt  we could be in default on such debt  and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 
the terms of the peninsula gaming indebtedness limits the payment of dividends other than tax distributions  distributions and management fees from peninsula gaming to boyd acquisition ii  llc holdco 
the promissory note that holdco entered into upon the closing of the peninsula acquisition the holdco note  which we entered into upon the closing of the peninsula acquisition  imposes limitations on holdco and on peninsula gaming and peninsula gaming subsidiaries with respect to i incurrence of indebtedness  ii liens  iii consolidations and mergers  iv sales and other dispositions of assets and v restricted payments  including investments 
subject to certain exceptions  we may be required to repay the amounts outstanding under the holdco note in connection with certain assets sales by peninsula gaming or upon a change of control 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
it is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs 
we believe that we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  at or before maturity  and 
table of contents cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we may have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners 
these financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  certain states laws contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions 
some restrictions may prevent us from obtaining necessary capital 
we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt  which could further exacerbate the risks described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the terms of the indenture governing our senior and senior subordinated notes will not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so 
at december   contractual availability under the boyd credit facility  peninsula credit facility and borgata bank credit facility were million  million and million  respectively 
all of those borrowings would be effectively senior to our senior and senior subordinated notes and the guarantees of our subsidiary guarantors to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such borrowings 
if new debt is added to our  or our subsidiaries  current debt levels  the related risks that we or they now face could intensify 
borgata may be unable to refinance its indebtedness 
borgata has outstanding indebtedness consisting of a million bank credit facility that matures in august and million in senior secured debt  million of which matures in october and million of which matures in august borgata ability to refinance its indebtedness will depend on its ability to generate future cash flow and borgata is entirely dependent on its operations  including the water club  for all of its cash flow 
its ability to generate cash in the future  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
it is unlikely that borgata business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations in amounts sufficient to enable it to pay the principal on its indebtedness at maturity and to fund its other liquidity needs 
we believe borgata will need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness before maturity  and we cannot provide assurances that it will be able to repay or refinance its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
borgata may have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners 
these financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  new jersey laws and regulations contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions 
such restrictions may prevent borgata from obtaining necessary capital 
if we are unable to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as other capital expenditures  through cash flow  borrowings under the credit facility and additional financings  our expansion  development  investment and renovation efforts will be jeopardized 
we intend to finance our current and future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as our other capital expenditures  primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under the credit facility  and equity or debt financings 
if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  or our other capital expenditures  we will have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing  delaying or abandoning planned expansion  development  investment and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  reducing the amount or suspending or discontinuing the distribution of dividends  obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners  or modifying the credit facility 
these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
recently  there have been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital 
we anticipate that these disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that we will be able to fund any expansion projects using cash flows from operations and availability under the credit facility to the extent that availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
if availability under the credit facility does not exist or we are otherwise unable to make sufficient borrowings thereunder  any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
as a result  if we are unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner  or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for projects  limit the scope of  or defer such projects  or cancel the projects altogether 
in the event that capital markets do not improve and we are unable to access capital with more favorable terms  additional equity and or credit support may be necessary to obtain construction financing for the remaining cost of the project 

table of contents risks related to the peninsula acquisition we may face integration difficulties and may be unable to integrate peninsula gaming business into boyd gaming business successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of the peninsula acquisition 
the merger involved the combination of two companies that previously operated as independent companies 
peninsula gaming is now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of boyd gaming 
we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the two companies business practices and operations 
potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following the inability to successfully combine our two businesses in a manner that permits the us to achieve the full revenue and other benefits anticipated to result from the peninsula acquisition  complexities associated with managing the combined businesses  including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems  technology  networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers  suppliers  employees and other constituencies  and potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the peninsula acquisition 
in addition  it is possible that the integration process could result in diversion of the attention of each company management  and the disruption of  or the loss of momentum in  each company ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies  any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers  suppliers  employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the peninsula acquisition  or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 
our future results may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma financial statements that we have previously disclosed 
the pro forma financial statements that we have previously disclosed are presented for illustrative purposes only  are based on various adjustments  assumptions and preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations following the peninsula acquisition for several reasons 
our actual financial condition and results of operations following the peninsula acquisition may not be consistent with  or evident from  these pro forma financial statements 
in addition  the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be accurate  and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following the peninsula acquisition 
any potential decline in our financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations to our stock price 
our future results could suffer if we cannot effectively manage our expanded operations following the peninsula acquisition 
following the peninsula acquisition  the size of the combined businesses is significantly larger than the previous size of either boyd gaming or peninsula gaming business 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to manage this expanded business  which will pose substantial challenges for management  including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize any operating efficiencies  cost savings  revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the peninsula acquisition 
we expect to further incur substantial expenses related to the peninsula acquisition and the integration of our businesses 
we have already incurred and expect to incur further substantial expenses in connection with the peninsula acquisition and the integration of our businesses 
there are a large number of processes  policies  procedures  operations  technologies and systems that must be integrated  including purchasing  accounting and finance  sales  payroll  pricing  marketing and benefits 
while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred  there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses 
moreover  many of the expenses that will be incurred are  by their nature  difficult to estimate accurately 
these integration expenses likely will result in us taking significant charges against earnings  and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present

item legal proceedings copeland alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder deceased of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino treasure chest  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against treasure chest 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest license  an award of the license to him  and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court  citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
the hearing has not yet been rescheduled 
mr 
copeland has since passed away and his son  the executor of his estate  has petitioned the court to be substituted as plaintiff in the case 
on june   the plaintiff filed to have the exceptions set for hearing 
the parties decided to submit the exceptions to the court on the previously filed briefs 
the court issued a ruling denying the exceptions on august  copeland counsel indicated a desire to move forward with the litigation and requested that the parties respond to outstanding discovery 
subsequently  on august   robert j 
guidry  the co defendant  filed a third party demand against the us attorney office seeking enforcement of guidry plea agreement which would limit guidry exposure in the case 
on september   the us attorney office removed the suit to the us district court  middle district of louisiana 
pending before the district court are a motion to dismiss for failing to state a cause of action filed by guidry  asserting the same arguments he tried in state court  which the company joined  and a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction filed by the us attorney  which may result in the case being remanded to state court 
the us district court heard the motions on march  a ruling has not yet been issued 
on april   the us attorney office moved for summary judgment  maintaining its jurisdictional argument as well as seeking substantive relief 
on september   the judge issued an order stating that the case should be remanded to state district court but allowed for additional filings by september  a remand order was issued on september   sending the case back to the th judicial district court  east baton rouge parish  state of louisiana 
guidry filed a motion for partial summary judgment on november  to limit the damages in the case 
treasure chest joined in the motion 
the hearing on the motion for partial summary judgment was held on september  on october   judge clark granted the motion which effectively struck copeland demands for loss profits  the value of the treasure chest license and the value of treasure chest success 
on october   copeland filed a supervisory writ application with the first circuit court of appeal asking 
table of contents that the partial summary judgment be reversed 
treasure chest and guidry opposed the writ 
on february   the writ was denied leaving intact the partial summary judgment 
discovery is proceeding 
we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on treasure chest business  financial condition and results of operations 
nevada use tax refund claims on march   the nevada supreme court issued a decision in sparks nugget  inc vs 
the state of nevada department of taxation the department  holding that food purchased for subsequent use in the provision of complimentary and or employee meals was exempt from use tax 
as a result of this decision  refund claims were filed for use taxes paid  over the period november through may  on food purchased for subsequent use in complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties 
we estimate the refund to be in the range of million to million  including interest 
in  the department audited and denied our refund claim while simultaneously issuing a million sales tax deficiency assessment  plus interest of million 
we appealed both the denial of the refund claim as well as the deficiency assessment in a hearing before the nevada administrative law judge alj in september in april  the judge issued a split decision  granting a refund on employee meals and applying a sales tax measure on complimentary meals  however  the ruling barred retroactive application of the sales tax measure to all years in the refund claim period  effectively overturning the department deficiency assessment 
both we and the department appealed the decision to the nevada state tax commission the commission 
on august   the commission remanded the case back for a second administrative hearing  which was held on september   to allow for the introduction of additional supporting documentation 
the alj issued a decision on november   reversing her position on the employee meal refund claim while also affirming the denial of the complimentary meal refund  as well as the denial of a retroactive application of the sales tax measure to both employee and complimentary meals 
the alj decision was affirmed in a commission hearing on january  on february  we filed a petition for judicial review in clark county district court 
we received a split decision at our district court hearing on october  the district court judge judge affirmed the alj decision that sales tax was applicable to complimentary meals and reversed the decision on employee meals  concluding that such meals were exempt from sales tax 
the department has asserted that  although the statute of limitations prohibits their ability to collect incremental sales tax on complimentary meals  the statutes provide for an offset of the incremental sales tax against refunds due on employee meals 
as such  the department believes that it is not required to pay the employee meal refunds 
we are appealing the decision on complimentary meals to the nevada state supreme court and the department has appealed the decision on employee meals 
the judge did not issue a decision with respect to the refund claim offset  and pending the ultimate resolution of the appeal at the state supreme court  we expect the offset issue will either be addressed by the supreme court or remanded back to district court 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of our appeal to the state supreme court  we will not record any gain until a final  non appealable decision has been rendered 
on july  the department retracted its previous guidance requiring payment of sales tax  on complimentary and employee meals  for periods subsequent to february  the updated guidance defers the requirement to collect and remit sales tax  without interest or penalty  on complimentary and employee meals until the occurrence of a defined future event 
based on the department updated guidance  we have not collected  remitted or accrued a liability for sales tax on complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties 
blue chip property taxes blue chip previously received a valuation notice from the county assessor indicating an unanticipated increase of nearly to its assessed property value as of january  in december  we received the property tax bill related to our tax assessment in the amount million  which we appealed 
in february  we received a notice of revaluation  reducing the initial tax assessment by approximately million 
since then  we have made the minimum required payment against provisional bills received in years through  all of which were based on the valuation notice 
during the year ended december   we reached settlements with the county assessor  reducing the annual valuation for years through based on these settlements  we revised our cumulative property tax accrual to reflect the retrospective effect of the revised valuations 
the impact of these revisions to the valuations resulted in a reduction of our property tax accrual of approximately million  which was cumulatively reversed through property tax expense during the year ended december  we received the tax assessment in january but have not received valuation notices or final tax rates for the years or the tax assessment increased the taxable property value approximately over the settlement valuation 
we have appealed the tax assessment and believe the assessments for the period from january  through december  could result in a total property tax obligation  net of previous payments  ranging between million and million 
we have accrued  net of the payment of the minimum requirements discussed above  approximately million for this property tax liability as of december   based on what we believe to be the most likely outcome within our range  once all valuations have been received and all tax rates have been finalized  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated amount accrued will approximate the actual amount billed 
the final tax assessment notices for the period january  through december   which have not been received as of december   could result in further adjustment to our estimated property tax liability at blue chip 

table of contents legal matters we are also parties to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that  except for the copeland matter discussed above  all pending claims  if adversely decided  would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations

our emphasis we operate gaming entertainment properties  most of which also include hotel  dining  retail and other amenities 
our main business emphasis is on slot revenues  which are highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties  which affects our operating results 
our properties have historically generated significant operating cash flow  with the majority of our revenue being cash based 
while we do provide casino credit  subject to certain gaming regulations and jurisdictions  most of our customers wager with cash and pay for non gaming services by cash or credit card 
our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow in order to fund maintenance capital expenditures  fund acquisitions  provide excess cash for future development  repay debt financing and associated interest costs  purchase our debt or equity securities  pay income taxes and pay dividends 
our key performance indicators we use several key performance indicators to evaluate the operations of our wholly owned properties and borgata

slot win and table game hold percentages represent the relationship between slot handle and table game drop to gaming wins and losses 
slot win and table game hold means the difference between customer wagers and customer winnings on slot machines and table games  respectively 
food and beverage revenue indicators average guest check is an indicator of volume and product offerings and is defined as the average amount spent per customer visit  number of guests served is an indicator of volume  and the cost per guest served is an indicator of operating margin 
room revenue indicators hotel occupancy rate is an indicator of volume measuring the utilization of our available rooms  and average daily rate adr is a price indicator 
our strategy our overriding strategy is to increase shareholder value 
we follow several strategic initiatives on which we are focused to improve and grow our business

operating efficiently we also remain committed to operating more efficiently and endeavor to prevent unneeded expense in our business 
the efficiencies of our business model position us to flow a substantial portion of revenue gains directly to the bottom line

our intention is to pursue opportunities that are a good fit for our business  deliver a solid return for shareholders  and are available at the right price 
maintaining our brand the ability of our employees to deliver great customer service remains a key differentiator for our company and our brands 
our employees are an important reason that our customers continue to choose our properties over the competition across the country 
our focus our focus has been and will remain on i ensuring our existing operations are managed as efficiently as possible  improving profitability and remaining positioned for growth  ii our capital structure and strengthening our balance sheet  not just by paying 
table of contents down debt  but also by strengthening our operations and diversifying our asset base  and iii our growth strategy  which is built on finding those assets that are a good strategic fit and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders 
overall outlook we believe that our key operating results for the year ended december  demonstrate some recovering trends in our business with certain regions showing more favorable results than others 
although the severe economic recession over the course of the past several years has had a profound effect on consumer confidence and has shifted spending away from discretionary items  such as leisure  hospitality  gaming and entertainment activities  we realized some recoverability in our business  as we saw several consecutive quarters of encouraging trends and anticipated that this recovery would continue 
however  starting in may  we began to experience weakness in economic trends locally  nationally and globally  due to a variety of factors 
we believe the economic recovery slowed and consumer confidence retracted during the second quarter of and as a result  our results for the second quarter did not meet our expectations  which also impacted our results for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter  we were encouraged to see sequential growth in our las vegas locals business 
we recognized million in non cash impairment charges related to our echelon project 
the disposal of echelon represents our priority to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our long term financial position 
economic influence due to a number of factors affecting consumers  including the increasing federal deficit and uncertainties surrounding the ability to achieve reconciliation to avoid the fiscal cliff  volatility in the stock market  the european debt crisis and high unemployment levels  all of which have resulted in reduced levels of consumer spending  the outlook for the gaming industry remains unpredictable 
we believe the severity and length of recovery from this economic recession has had a profound effect on consumer behavior and has led to a shift in spending from discretionary items 
because of these uncertain conditions  we have increasingly focused on managing our operating margins and increasing our brand awareness 
our present objective is to manage our cost and expense structure to address current business volumes  generate strong and stable cash flows and position the company to benefit from improved flow through of revenue growth 
positioning we continually work to position our company for greater success by strengthening our existing operations and growing through capital investment and other strategic initiatives

results of operations summary years ended december   and we believe that our key operating results for the year ended december  demonstrate some recovering trends in our business with certain regions showing more favorable operating results than others 
although over the course of the past several years  the severe economic recession has had a profound effect on consumer confidence  and has shifted spending away from discretionary items  such as leisure  hospitality  gaming and entertainment activities  results during the year ended december  indicate that we continue to face a challenging economic environment despite having realized some stabilizing trends in our business 
generally  the job market is strengthening  as the national unemployment rate has continued to decline throughout  however  these favorable factors were offset by fluctuating consumer confidence and uncertainties regarding government fiscal policies 
starting in may  we began to experience weakness in economic trends locally and nationally  that were further amplified by the global macro economic issues  due to a variety of factors 
as the job market recovers and expands  we believe that consumer confidence will strengthen further 
specifically  in our las vegas locals region  visitor counts  room rates and convention sales began to stabilize and slightly increase over the prior year 
our downtown las vegas segment is benefiting from successful marketing efforts to our hawaiian customers  and the strength of the local hawaiian economy 
the economy in the midwest and south region has been more resilient than the national and las vegas economies 
although we continue to be the market leader in atlantic city  the entire market continues to experience a difficult period  due to increased local and regional competition  as well as the recovery that is ongoing due to the post tropical storm that closed the borgata from october  to november  as discussed in note  consolidation of certain interests  we concluded that a change in control of the borgata had occurred and we began consolidating the borgata into our financial statements effective march  we had previously accounted for and reported the borgata as an equity method investment

under the terms of the agreement  the casinos are required to make scheduled payments to the njsea totaling million to be used for certain authorized purposes the authorized uses as defined by the agreement 
for each year  each casino share of the scheduled payments will equate to a percentage representing its gross gaming revenue for the prior calendar year compared to the gross gaming revenues for that period for all casinos 
each casino  solely and individually  shall be responsible for its respective share of the scheduled amounts due 
in the event that any casino shall fail to make its payment as required  the remaining casinos shall have the right  but not the obligation  to cure a payment delinquency 
as a result  borgata expenses its pro rata share of the million  estimated to be approximately million based on its actual market shares of gross gaming revenue  on a straight line basis over the applicable term of the agreement 
borgata recorded expense of million during each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
atlantic city tourism district as part of the state of new jersey plan to revitalize atlantic city  a new law was enacted in february requiring that a tourism district the tourism district be created and managed by the crda 
the tourism district has been established to include each of the atlantic city casino properties along with certain other tourism related areas of atlantic city 
the law requires that a public private partnership be created between the crda and a private entity that represents existing and future casino licensees 
the private entity  known as the atlantic city alliance the aca  has been established in the form of a not for profit limited liability company  of which mddc is a member 
the public private partnership between the aca and crda shall be for an initial term of five years and its general purpose shall be to revitalize the tourism district 
the law requires that a million contribution be made to this effort by all casinos prior to followed by an annual amount of million to be contributed by the casinos commencing january  for a term of five years 
each casino share of the annual contributions will equate to a percentage representing its gross gaming revenue for the prior calendar year compared to the aggregate gross gaming revenues for that period for all casinos 
as a result  borgata will expense their pro rata share of the million as incurred 
during the year ended december  and  borgata incurred expense of million and million for the pro rata share of the initial contribution to the aca 
capital spending and development borgata continually performs on going refurbishment and maintenance at facilities to maintain standards of quality 
certain of these maintenance costs are capitalized  if such improvement or refurbishment extends the life of the related asset  while other maintenance costs that do not so qualify are expensed as incurred 
although borgata does not have any present future expansion projects  if any opportunities arise  such projects will require significant capital commitments 
the commitment of capital and the related timing thereof are contingent upon  among other things  negotiation of final agreements and receipt of approvals from the appropriate regulatory bodies 
borgata must also comply with covenants and restrictions set forth in the debt agreements 
borgata intends to incur million during  primarily on room remodel and various maintenance capital projects with such capital expenditures being funded through the credit facility and operating cash flows 
the commitment of capital and the related timing thereof are contingent upon  among other things  negotiation of final agreements and receipt of approvals from the appropriate regulatory bodies 
borgata must also comply with covenants and restrictions set forth in the debt agreements 
contingencies copeland alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder deceased of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino treasure chest  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against treasure chest 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest license  an award of the license to him  and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court  citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   
table of contents the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
the hearing has not yet been rescheduled 
mr 
copeland has since passed away and his son  the executor of his estate  has petitioned the court to be substituted as plaintiff in the case 
on june   the plaintiff filed to have the exceptions set for hearing 
the parties decided to submit the exceptions to the court on the previously filed briefs 
the court issued a ruling denying the exceptions on august  copeland counsel indicated a desire to move forward with the litigation and requested that the parties respond to outstanding discovery 
subsequently  on august   robert j 
guidry  the co defendant  filed a third party demand against the us attorney office seeking enforcement of guidry plea agreement which would limit guidry exposure in the case 
on september   the us attorney office removed the suit to the us district court  middle district of louisiana 
pending before the district court are a motion to dismiss for failing to state a cause of action filed by guidry  asserting the same arguments he tried in state court  which the company joined  and a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction filed by the us attorney  which may result in the case being remanded to state court 
the us district court heard the motions on march  a ruling has not yet been issued 
on april   the us attorney office moved for summary judgment  maintaining its jurisdictional argument as well as seeking substantive relief 
on september   the judge issued an order stating that the case should be remanded to state district court but allowed for additional filings by september  a remand order was issued on september   sending the case back to the th judicial district court  east baton rouge parish  state of louisiana 
guidry filed a motion for partial summary judgment on november  to limit the damages in the case 
treasure chest joined in the motion 
the hearing on the motion for partial summary judgment was held on september  on october   judge clark granted the motion which effectively struck copeland demands for loss profits  the value of the treasure chest license and the value of treasure chest success 
on october   copeland filed a supervisory writ application with the first circuit court of appeal asking that the partial summary judgment be reversed 
treasure chest and guidry opposed the writ 
on february   the writ was denied leaving intact the partial summary judgment 
discovery is proceeding 
we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on treasure chest business  financial condition and results of operations 
nevada use tax refund claims on march   the nevada supreme court issued a decision in sparks nugget  inc vs 
the state of nevada department of taxation the department  holding that food purchased for subsequent use in the provision of complimentary and or employee meals was exempt from use tax 
as a result of this decision  refund claims were filed for use taxes paid  over the period november through may  on food purchased for subsequent use in complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties 
we estimate the refund to be in the range of million to million  including interest 
in  the department audited and denied our refund claim while simultaneously issuing a million sales tax deficiency assessment  plus interest of million 
we appealed both the denial of the refund claim as well as the deficiency assessment in a hearing before the nevada administrative law judge alj in september in april  the judge issued a split decision  granting a refund on employee meals and applying a sales tax measure on complimentary meals  however  the ruling barred retroactive application of the sales tax measure to all years in the refund claim period  effectively overturning the department deficiency assessment 
both we and the department appealed the decision to the nevada state tax commission the commission 
on august   the commission remanded the case back for a second administrative hearing  which was held on september   to allow for the introduction of additional supporting documentation 
the alj issued a decision on november   reversing her position on the employee meal refund claim while also affirming the denial of the complimentary meal refund  as well as the denial of a retroactive application of the sales tax measure to both employee and complimentary meals 
the alj decision was affirmed in a commission hearing on january  on february  we filed a petition for judicial review in clark county district court 
we received a split decision at our district court hearing on october  the district court judge judge affirmed the alj decision that sales tax was applicable to complimentary meals and reversed the decision on employee meals  concluding that such meals were exempt from sales tax 
the department has asserted that  although the statute of limitations prohibits their ability to collect incremental sales tax on complimentary meals  the statutes provide for an offset of the incremental sales tax against refunds due on employee meals 
as such  the department believes that it is not required to pay the employee meal refunds 
we are appealing the decision on complimentary meals to the nevada state supreme court and the department has appealed the decision on employee meals 
the judge did not issue a decision with respect to the refund claim offset  and pending the ultimate resolution of the appeal at the state supreme court  we expect the offset issue will either be addressed by the supreme court or remanded back to district court 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of our appeal to the state supreme court  we will not record any gain until a final  non appealable decision has been rendered 
on july  the department retracted its previous guidance requiring payment of sales tax  on complimentary and employee meals  for periods subsequent to february  the updated guidance defers the requirement to collect and remit sales tax  without interest or penalty  on complimentary and employee meals until the occurrence of a defined future event 
based on the department updated guidance  we have not collected  remitted or accrued a liability for sales tax on complimentary and employee meals at our nevada casino properties 

table of contents blue chip property taxes blue chip previously received a valuation notice from the county assessor indicating an unanticipated increase of nearly to its assessed property value as of january  in december  we received the property tax bill related to our tax assessment in the amount million  which we appealed 
in february  we received a notice of revaluation  reducing the initial tax assessment by approximately million 
since then  we have made the minimum required payment against provisional bills received in years through  all of which were based on the valuation notice 
during the year ended december   we reached settlements with the county assessor  reducing the annual valuation for years through based on these settlements  we revised our cumulative property tax accrual to reflect the retrospective effect of the revised valuations 
the impact of these revisions to the valuations resulted in a reduction of our property tax accrual of approximately million  which was cumulatively reversed through property tax expense during the year ended december  we received the tax assessment in january but have not received valuation notices or final tax rates for the years or the tax assessment increased the taxable property value approximately over the settlement valuation 
we have appealed the tax assessment and believe the assessments for the period from january  through december  could result in a total property tax obligation  net of previous payments  ranging between million and million 
we have accrued  net of the payment of the minimum requirements discussed above  approximately million for this property tax liability as of december   based on what we believe to be the most likely outcome within our range  once all valuations have been received and all tax rates have been finalized  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated amount accrued will approximate the actual amount billed 
the final tax assessment notices for the period january  through december   which have not been received as of december   could result in further adjustment to our estimated property tax liability at blue chip

table of contents other opportunities we regularly investigate and pursue additional expansion opportunities in markets where casino gaming is currently permitted 
we also pursue expansion opportunities in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
such expansions will be affected and determined by several key factors  which may include the following the outcome of gaming license selection processes  the approval of gaming in jurisdictions where we have been active but where casino gaming is not currently permitted  identification of additional suitable investment opportunities in current gaming jurisdictions  and availability of acceptable financing 
additional projects may require us to make substantial investments or may cause us to incur substantial costs related to the investigation and pursuit of such opportunities  which investments and costs we may fund through cash flow from operations or availability under our credit facility 
to the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient  we may also seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
moreover  we can provide no assurances that any expansion opportunity will result in a completed transaction 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements mainly consist of the following agreements to provide electricity  emergency electricity generation  and chilled and hot water to echelon and borgata 
on february   we and dania entertainment center  llc the buyer entered into an asset purchase agreement the agreement for the sale of certain assets and liabilities of the dania jai alai business  our pari mutuel facility  located in dania beach  broward county  florida at which jai alai and related gaming operations are conducted  including poker and inter track wagering  for a purchase price of million the purchase price 
the closing of the transactions contemplated by the agreement is subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to occur at or before may  on march   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the echelon site for million in cash 
the sale agreement includes the acre land parcel  as well as site improvements 
the transaction was completed on march   and we received million of net proceeds after payment of a portion of the proceeds to a third party to fulfill our obligations to lve energy partners  llc 
utility contract in  borgata amended its executory contracts with a wholly owned subsidiary of a local utility company  extending the end of the term to years from the opening of the water club 
the utility company provides borgata with electricity and thermal energy hot water and chilled water 
obligations under the thermal energy executory contract contain both fixed fees and variable fees based upon usage rates 
the fixed fee components under the thermal energy executory contract are currently estimated at approximately million per annum 
borgata also committed to purchase a certain portion of its electricity demand at essentially a fixed rate  which is estimated at approximately million per annum 
electricity demand in excess of the commitment is subject to market rates based on borgata tariff class 
indemnification we have entered into certain agreements that contain indemnification provisions  as well as indemnification agreements involving certain of our executive officers and directors 
these agreements provide indemnity insurance pursuant to which directors and officers are indemnified or insured against liability or loss under certain circumstances  which may include liability or related loss under the securities act and the exchange act 
in addition  our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that provide for indemnification of our directors  officers  employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by law 
outstanding letters of credit at december  and  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
other arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than interest rate swaps  interest rate collars and interest rate caps 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews and refines those estimates  the following of which materially impact our consolidated financial statements the recoverability of long lived assets  preservation of assets held for development  application of acquisition method of accounting to our controlling interest in borgata  valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill  determination of self insured reserves  and provisions for deferred tax assets  certain tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions 
judgments are based on information including  but not limited to  historical experience  industry trends  conventional practices  expert opinions  terms of existing agreements and information from outside sources 
judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  and therefore actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment and complexity  the sensitivity of which could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recoverability of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if triggering events are identified  we then compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
the asset is not impaired if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  then an impairment charge is recorded  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model  which is based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year free cash flow multiples 
we reconsider changes in circumstances on a frequent basis  and if a triggering event related to potential impairment has occurred  we solicit third party valuation expertise to assist in the valuation of our investment 
there are three generally accepted approaches available in developing an opinion of value the cost  sales comparison and income approaches 
we generally consider each of these approaches in developing a recommendation of the fair value of the asset  however the reliability of each approach is dependent upon the availability and comparability of the market data uncovered  as well as  the decision making criteria used by market participants when evaluating a property 
we will bifurcate our investment and apply the most indicative approach to overall fair valuation  or in some cases  a weighted analysis of any or all of these methods 
developing an opinion of land value is typically accomplished using a sales comparison approach by analyzing recent sales transactions of similar sites 
potential comparables are researched and the pertinent facts are confirmed with parties involved in the transaction 
this process fosters a general understanding of the potential comparable sales and facilitates the selection of the most relevant comparables by the appraiser 
valuation is typically accomplished using a unit of comparison such as price per square foot of land or potential building area 
adjustments are applied to the unit of comparison from an analysis of comparable sales  and the adjusted unit of comparison is then used to derive a value for the property 
the cost approach is based on the premise that a prudent investor would pay no more for an asset of similar utility than its replacement or reproduction cost 
the cost to replace the asset would include the cost of constructing a similar asset of equivalent utility at prices applicable at the time of the valuation date 
to arrive at an estimate of the fair value using the cost approach  the replacement cost new is determined and reduced for depreciation of the asset 
replacement cost new is defined as the current cost of producing or constructing a similar new item having the nearest equivalent utility as the property being valued 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of the asset 
the underlying premise of this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the subject asset 
the steps followed in applying this approach include estimating the expected before tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its life and converting these before tax cash flows to present value through capitalization or discounting 
the process uses a rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and risk factors 
there are two common methods for converting net income into value  those methods are the direct capitalization and discounted cash flow methods dcf 
direct capitalization is a method used to convert an estimate of a single year income expectancy into an indication of value in one direct step by dividing the income estimate by an appropriate capitalization rate 
under the dcf method  anticipated future cash flows and a reversionary value are discounted to an opinion of net present value at a specific internal rate of return or a yield rate  because net operating income of the subject property is not fully stabilized 
our long lived assets were carried at billion at december   or of our consolidated total assets 
a long lived 
table of contents asset shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances i 
a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  ii 
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  iii 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iv 
an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  v 
a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  and or vi 
a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
as further discussed in note  property and equipment  net  during the year ended december   we recognized million of non cash impairment charges related to various parcels of undeveloped land 
as further discussed in note  assets held for development  we also recognized million of non cash impairment charges related to our echelon project including land  and construction in progress based on the difference between the book value of the assets and the estimated realizable value of the assets 
disposal of assets held for development in august  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip 
at that time  we did not anticipate the long term effects of the current economic downturn  evidenced by lower occupancy rates  declining room rates and reduced consumer spending across the country  but particularly in the las vegas geographical area  nor did we predict that the incremental supply becoming available on the las vegas strip would face such depressed demand levels  thereby elongating the time for absorption of this additional supply into the market 
the further delay of the echelon project implied that the carrying amounts of the assets related to the development may not be recoverable  therefore  at the time  we performed an impairment test of these assets 
these impairment tests were comprised of an appraisal of the development and an analysis of its future undiscounted cash flow  and contemplated several viable alternative plans for the future development of echelon 
the cash inflows related to the revenue projections for the individual components associated with each planned construction scenario  offset by outflows for estimated costs to complete the development and ongoing maintenance and operating costs 
we initially performed this evaluation during the year ended december  we updated these analyses during the year ended december  to evaluate any further depression in real estate or land values as well as any deterioration in our in initial cash flow assumptions 
the outcome of this evaluation resulted in no impairment of echelon assets  as the estimated weighted net undiscounted cash flows from the project exceed the current carrying value of the assets of approximately billion at december  in december  we reconsidered our commitment to complete the echelon project and concluded we would not resume development 
as a result of this decision  we now expect to dispose of the assets 
we updated our impairment analysis to compare the difference between the book value of the assets and the estimated realizable value of the assets 
based on this scenario  we recognized an impairment at december   of million based on the difference between the book value of the assets and the estimated realizable value of the assets as discussed in note  property and equipment  and note  assets held for development 
due to the termination of the project  no additional project costs will be capitalized 
application of acquisition method of accounting acquisition of peninsula gaming on november   we completed the peninsula acquisition pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement entered into on may   by and among the company  boyd acquisition ii  llc  boyd acquisition sub  llc  peninsula gaming partners  llc pgp and peninsula gaming  llc  under which an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the 
table of contents company acquired of the outstanding common shares of peninsula gaming  the assets and assumed the liabilities 
the acquisition added five properties from three different states including kansas  iowa and louisiana 
peninsula gaming owns and operates diamond jo casino in dubuque  iowa  evangeline downs racetrack and casino  in st 
landry parish  louisiana  various off track betting facilities in louisiana  diamond jo casino in northwood  iowa  amelia belle casino in amelia  louisiana  and the kansas star casino  hotel and event center kansas star near wichita  kansas 
accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities of peninsula gaming are included in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and the results of its operations and cash flows are reported in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows from november  through december   respectively  during the year ended december  as a result of the peninsula acquisition  the company will be able to expand its operations to the new geographical areas 
the net purchase price  after adjustment for working capital and other items was approximately billion 
the financial position of peninsula gaming is consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in total  peninsula gaming represents of our consolidated total assets at december   respectively 
during the year ended december   pgl contributed million in net revenues for the period from november  through december  acquisition of ip casino resort spa ip on october   we completed the acquisition of ip casino resort spa ip in biloxi  mississippi pursuant to an agreement for purchase and sale  under which the seller agreed to sell and transfer  and the company agreed to purchase and assume  certain assets and liabilities  respectively  related to the imperial palace biloxi  on an as is basis 
the net purchase price was approximately million 
in addition to the net purchase price  the company intends to perform certain capital improvement projects with respect to the property at an estimated cost of million 
the business combination resulted in the recording of a bargain purchase gain of approximately million  due to the excess fair value of net identifiable assets over the total consideration  and is reflected in other income on the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  consolidation of borgata upon effectively obtaining control of borgata  we were required to apply acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for business combinations 
the application of the acquisition method of accounting guidance had the following effects on our consolidated financial statements i our previously held equity interest was measured at a provisional fair value at the date control was obtained  ii we recognized and measured the identifiable assets and liabilities in accordance with promulgated valuation recognition and measurement provisions  and iii we recorded the noncontrolling interest held in trust for the economic benefit of mgm as a separate component of our stockholders equity 
the provisional fair value measurements and estimates of these items were subsequently refined during the one year measurement period 
we had provisionally recorded these fair values using an earnings valuation multiple model  because  at the time of the preliminary estimate  we had not completed our procedures with respect to the independent valuation of the business enterprise and borgata tangible and intangible assets 
our subsequent valuation procedures have necessitated a revision of the valuation of the provisional assets and liabilities 
thus  upon finalization of our valuation  certain measurement period adjustments were identified and retrospectively recorded as of december  these measurement period adjustments materially shifted the value of certain tangible and intangible assets 
we have applied the measurement period adjustments retrospectively to the consolidated balance sheet reported as of december  however  the impact on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   as retrospectively adjusted  to the statement as reported was not material  and was therefore not adjusted for any measurement period adjustments 
the revisions to the provisional values of assets consists of reallocations of certain tangible assets and the recordation of other intangible assets  the accrual of certain liabilities  including the recording of the deferred tax effect of the appreciated asset values  and the resulting effect on the fair value of the controlling and noncontrolling interests 
we determined the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships  a trademark and any other significant tangible assets or liabilities  such as long lived property 
the enterprise value allocation methodology required management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimated the fair value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash flows and replacement cost analysis 
if estimates or assumptions used to complete the enterprise valuation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities significantly differed from assumptions made  the resulting difference could materially affect the fair value of net assets 
we will continue to perform impairment tests of the indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with our existing policy  as discussed below 
additionally  given the anticipated sale of the mgm interest  we will maintain a heightened awareness of any potential triggering events which would indicate a possible impairment of the intangible assets or long lived assets 
the financial position of borgata is consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and  and during the year ended december   we recorded a step up to the basis of borgata historical financial statements of million  
table of contents which is an appreciation over their historical book basis of approximately 
valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets gaming license rights represent the value of the license to conduct gaming in certain jurisdictions  which is subject to highly extensive regulatory oversight and a limitation on the number of licenses available for issuance with these certain jurisdictions 
these assets  considered indefinite lived intangible assets  are not subject to amortization  but instead are subject to an annual impairment test  performed in the second quarter of each year  and between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
if the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
license rights are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach  and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relief from royalty method 
the value of gaming licenses is determined using a multi period excess earnings method  which is a specific discounted cash flow model 
the value is determined at an amount equal to the present value of the incremental after tax cash flows attributable only to future gaming revenue  discounted to present value at a risk adjusted rate of return 
with respect to the application of this methodology  we used the following significant projections and assumptions gaming revenues  gaming operating expenses  general and administrative expenses  tax expense  terminal value  and discount rate 
these projections are modeled for a five year period 
trademarks are based on the value of our brand  which reflects the level of service and quality we provide and from which we generate repeat business 
trademarks are valued using the relief from royalty method  which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks  we would have to make a stream of payments to a brand or franchise owner in return for the right to use their name 
by virtue of this asset  we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible value of our ownership of the brand name 
we used the following significant projections and assumptions to determine value under the relief from royalty method revenue from gaming and hotel activities  royalty rate  tax expense  terminal growth rate  discount rate  and the present value of tax benefit 
the projections underlying this discounted cash flow model were forecasted for fifteen years 
applying the selected pretax royalty rates to the applicable revenue base in each period yielded pretax income for each property trademarks and trade name 
these pretax totals were tax effected utilizing the applicable tax rate to arrive at net  after tax cash flows 
the net  after tax flows were then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate 
the present value of the after tax cash flows were then added to the present value of the amortization tax benefit considering the year amortization of intangible assets pursuant to recent tax legislation to arrive at the recommended fair values for the trademarks and trade names 
at december   the carrying value of our trademarks was million  which includes the addition of million related to the acquisition of peninsula gaming and million related to the consolidation of borgata 
at december   the fair value of our trademarks exceeded their carrying value 
at december   the carrying value of our trademarks was million  which includes the addition of million related to the acquisition of ip and million related to the consolidation of borgata during the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   the fair value of our trademarks exceeded their carrying value 
these indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization  but are subject to an annual impairment test and between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
our impairment test  performed in the second quarter of did not result in any impairment of these intangible assets during the year ended december  we did however  perform an interim test with respect to the borgata trademark  and recorded a million impairment of the borgata trademark during the year ended december   based on a degradation in their forecasted revenues due to our consideration of certain facts and circumstances surrounding an adverse change in the business climate in atlantic city 
we believe our actual results have been adversely impacted by increased regional competition  and that in addition  borgata projected future results will be further negatively impacted by the opening of a new property in atlantic city  which was announced in february we evaluate whether any triggering events or changes in circumstances had occurred subsequent to our annual impairment test that would indicate an impairment condition may exist 
this evaluation required significant judgment  including consideration of whether there had been any significant adverse changes in legal factors or in our business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or likely sale or disposal of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
based upon this evaluation  we concluded that there had not been any triggering events or changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment condition existed as of december  if an event described above occurs  and results in a significant impact to our revenue and profitability projections  or any significant assumption in our valuations methods is adversely impacted  the impact could result in a material impairment charge in the future 
valuation of goodwill the authoritative guidance related to goodwill impairment requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually using a two step impairment test 
step one of the test is a screen used to identify whether or not goodwill impairment may exist 
in step one  an entity compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if a reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value  goodwill impairment may exist 
step two of the test must then be performed to 
table of contents measure the amount of impairment  if any 
in step two  an entity compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill should be determined in the same manner that goodwill is measured in a business combination  that is  an entity must allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
we solicit third party valuation expertise to assist in the performance of the step one valuations of the goodwill of our reporting units 
we perform the test in the second quarter of our fiscal calendar year  using a weighting of two different approaches was employed to determine fair value i the income approach and ii the market approach 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow method  which focuses on the expected cash flow of the subject company 
in applying this approach  the cash flow available for distribution is calculated for a finite period of years 
cash flow available for distribution is defined  for purposes of this analysis  as the amount of cash that could be distributed as a dividend without impairing the future profitability or operations of the subject company 
the cash flow available for distribution and the terminal value the value of the subject company at the end of the estimation period are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of value of the business enterprise 
in the valuation of an asset  the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of the subject asset 
the underlying premise of this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the subject asset 
the steps followed in applying this approach include estimating the expected after tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its life and converting these after tax cash flows to present value through discounting 
the discounting process uses a rate of return which accounts for both the time value of money and investment risk factors 
finally  the present value of the after tax cash flows over the life of the asset is totaled to arrive at an indication of the fair value of the asset 
the market approach is comprised of the guideline company method  which focuses on comparing the subject company to selected reasonably similar  or guideline  publicly traded companies 
under this method  valuation multiples are i derived from the operating data of selected guideline companies  ii evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the subject company relative to the selected guideline companies  and iii applied to the operating data of the subject company to arrive at an indication of value 
in the valuation of an asset  the market approach measures value based on what typical purchasers in the market have paid for assets which can be considered reasonably similar to those being valued 
when the market approach is utilized  data are collected on the prices paid for reasonably comparable assets 
adjustments are made to the similar assets to compensate for differences between reasonably similar assets and the asset being valued 
the application of the market approach results in an estimate of the price reasonably expected to be realized from the sale of the subject asset 
the two methodologies were weighted toward the income approach and toward the market approach  to arrive at an overall fair value 
at december  and  the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value 
at such dates  we evaluated whether any triggering events or changes in circumstances had occurred subsequent to our annual impairment test that would indicate an impairment condition may exist 
this evaluation required significant judgment  including consideration of whether there had been any significant adverse changes in legal factors or in our business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or likely sale or disposal of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
based upon this evaluation  we concluded that there had not been any triggering events or changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment condition existed at either december  or although we satisfied step one by a fair margin for each reporting unit tested certain underlying assumptions and variables could greatly impact the results of future tests 
on a macro economic level  we believe that over the next few years  several trends are expected to continue to adversely affect the gaming industry 
the most significant trends include i delayed development of new construction  ii increased bankruptcy filings  and iii decreased consolidation 
the impact of the weakening economy  credit crunch  and general outlook of the casino resort industry is illustrated through the recent trend of abandoned casino projects 
bankruptcy has served as a deterrent to deals because of the large decline in cash flow as well as significant increases in leverage 
debt to ebitda ratios for public companies has nearly doubled overall in the past few years  indicating that such a drastic increase shows the inability to service debt 
although we cannot control or influence the impact of these factors from a fair valuation perspective  they could nonetheless have a material effect on the results of valuation  particularly the guideline company method under the market approach  in the future 
additionally  several of the assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow method under the income approach could pose a high degree of sensitivity to the resulting fair value 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following total revenue  depreciation expense  depreciation overhang  tax expense and effective rates  debt free net working capital  capital additions  
table of contents terminal year growth factor  discount rate and the capitalization rate 
a change in any of these variables that cause our undiscounted cash flows or terminal value or both to adversely and materially change would result in the failure of the step one test  and a resulting impairment of our goodwill in an amount up to its book value of million 
determination of self insured reserves the company is fully self insured for general liability costs and self insured for workers compensation costs up to a stop loss limit of million 
self insurance reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  case reserves as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
case reserves represent estimated liability for unpaid loss  based on a claims administrator estimates of future payments on individual reported claims  including loss adjustment expenses lae 
generally  lae includes claims settlement costs directly assigned to specific claims  such as legal fees 
we estimate case and lae reserves on a combined basis  but do not include claim administration costs in our estimated ultimate loss reserves 
ibnr reserves include the provision for unreported claims  changes in case reserves  and future payments on reopened claims 
we have relied upon an industry based method to establish our self insurance reserves  which projects the ultimate losses estimated by multiplying the exposures by a selected ultimate loss rate 
the selected ultimate loss rates were determined based on a review of ultimate loss rates for prior years  adjusted for loss and exposure trend  and benefit level changes 
we believe this method best provides an appropriate result  given the maturing experience and relative stabilization of our claims history 
in previous years  and in certain instances  loss rates were based on industry loss development factors ldfs 
industry ldfs are from various national sources for workers compensation and general liability claims  and we utilize the most recent information available  although there is some lag time between compilation and publishing of such reports  during which unfavorable trends or data could emerge  which would not be reflected in our reserves 
for workers compensation  using payroll by state as weights  we calculate a weighted average industry ldf  for general liability claims  we use gross revenues as weights  and apply to a weighted average industry ldf to yield an initial expectation of the ultimate loss amount 
the paid ldfs are used to determine the percentage of the expected ultimate loss that is expected to be unpaid as of the reserving date 
this future unpaid percentage is multiplied by the expected ultimate losses to derive the expected future paid losses 
as a loss year matures  the expected future paid losses are replaced by actual paid losses 
in the computation of workers compensation claims  we exclude any claim which has reached our stop loss limitation  and therefore  we do not include any allowance for expected recoverable from excess or reinsurance 
we are  however  contingently liable in the event such reinsurer cannot meet its obligations 
although we place this risk with insurers rated better than a with am best  a national insurance company rating agency  there can be no assurance that such reinsurer will be able to meet their obligations in the future 
at december   unpaid case reserves on claims in excess of million  which we have subrogated to the reinsurer  totaled less than million 
in estimating our reserves for unpaid losses  it is also necessary to project future loss payments 
actual future losses will not develop exactly as projected and may  in fact  vary significantly from the projections 
further  the projections make no provision for future emergence of new classes of losses or types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical database or that are not yet quantifiable 
additionally  our results are estimates based on long term averages 
actual loss experience in any given year may differ from what is suggested by these averages 
the sensitivity of key variables and assumptions in the analysis was considered 
key variables and assumptions include but are not limited to loss development factors  trend factors and the expected loss rates ratios used 
it is possible that reasonable alternative selections would produce materially different reserve estimates 
management believes the estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon this methodology  however  changes in key variables and assumptions used above  or generally in health care costs  accident frequency and severity could materially affect the estimate for these reserves 
provisions for deferred tax assets  certain tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions income taxes are recorded under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance  if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on more likely than not realization threshold 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with the usability of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before expiration  and tax planning alternatives 

table of contents the company income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates 
the company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes  which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the position  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we have established contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures 
our tax reserves reflect management judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
while we believe our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a taxing authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve 
with respect to these reserves  our income tax expense would include i any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances ie  new information surrounding a tax issue and ii any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period 
our balance for uncertain tax benefits as of december  was million 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differ from our estimates  we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense  which could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
recently issued accounting pronouncements a variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and certain regulatory agencies 
because of the tentative and preliminary nature of such proposed standards  we have not yet determined the effect  if any  that the implementation of such proposed standards would have on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards update intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment update in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued update which is an amendment to topic of the accounting standards codification asc 
the objective of update is to amend asc is to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets by simplifying how an entity tests those assets for impairment and to improve consistency in impairment testing guidance among long lived asset categories 
the guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the entity must record an impairment 
update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   although early adoption is permitted 
in september  the company adopted update update will not have a material impact on the computation of the impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  specifically long term us treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high yield investment market  short term and long term libor rates  and short term eurodollar rates  and their potential impact on our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under ours and borgata bank credit facilities 
borrowings under boyd credit facility are based upon  at our option  libor or the base rate  plus an applicable margin in either case 
the base rate under the credit facility is the highest of x bank of america publicly announced prime rate  y the federal funds rate plus  or z the eurodollar rate for a one month period plus 
pursuant to the credit facility  i at any time and to the extent that the incremental term loan is a eurodollar rate loan  the incremental term loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each interest period at a rate per annual equal to the effective eurodollar 
table of contents rate for such period plus  and ii at any time and to the extent that the incremental term loan is a base rate committed loan  the incremental term loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the base rate for such interest period plus 
the applicable margin is a percentage per annum determined in accordance with a specified pricing grid based on the total leverage ratio 
the applicable margin on the outstanding balance on the extended revolving facility ranges from to if using libor  and from to if using the base rate 
borrowings under peninsula gaming credit facility consist of the term loan and the revolver 
the applicable margin on the outstanding balance on the term loan is i if using libor  or if using the base rate 
the applicable margin on the outstanding balance on the revolver is i if using libor or if using the base rate 
in addition  peninsula gaming will incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility at a per annum rate of 
the base rate under the credit facility is the highest of x bank of america publicly announced prime rate  y the federal funds rate plus  or z the eurodollar rate for a one month period plus outstanding borrowings under the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  accrue interest at a rate based upon either i the highest of a the agent bank quoted prime rate  b the one month eurodollar rate plus  and c the daily federal funds rate plus  and in any event not less than such highest rate  the base rate  or ii the eurodollar rate  plus with respect to each of clause i and ii an applicable margin as provided in the borgata bank credit facility  as amended 
in addition  a commitment fee is incurred on the unused portion of the borgata bank credit facility  as amended  ranging from per annum to per annum 
historically  we have attempted to manage the impact of interest rate risk on boyd long term debt by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company previously entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap arrangements in order to manage interest rate risk relating to its credit facility 
we were a party to certain floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million  whereby we received payments based upon the three month libor and made payments based upon a stipulated fixed rate 
these interest rate swap agreements modified the company exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting a portion of the company floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
the interest rate swap agreements terminated on june the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the weighted average variable rates are based upon prevailing interest rates
