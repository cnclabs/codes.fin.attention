item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company focused on oncology 
our proprietary technology is designed to administer high dose chemotherapy and other therapeutic agents to diseased organs or regions of the body  while controlling the systemic exposure of those agents 
our initial focus is on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers 
we believe that the proprietary technology is a platform that may have broader applicability  including the use of other drugs to treat the liver  as well as for the treatment of cancers in other organs and regions of the body 
in  we announced that our randomized phase clinical trial for patients with metastatic melanoma in the liver had successfully achieved the study primary endpoint of extended hepatic progression free survival 
we have also completed a multi arm phase trial to treat other liver cancers 
outside of the united states  our proprietary system to deliver and filter melphalan hydrochloride is marketed as a device under the trade name delcath hepatic chemosat delivery system chemosat delivery system for melphalan 
in april  we obtained authorization to affix a ce mark for the generation two chemosat delivery system for melphalan 
the right to affix the ce mark allows the company to market and sell the chemosat system for melphalan in europe 
in october  we satisfied all of the requirements to affix the ce mark to the hepatic chemosat delivery system device for intra hepatic arterial delivery and extracorporeal filtration of doxorubicin hydrochloride injection chemosat system for doxorubicin 
in the united states  our proprietary system for the administration of melphalan hydrochloride to the liver is considered a combination drug and device product  and is regulated as a drug by the united states food and drug administration fda 
we submitted our new drug application nda to the fda on august   with the proposed trade name melblez kittm melblez melphalan for injection for use with the delcath hepatic delivery system melblez kit  and are seeking approval for commercial sale of the melblez kit in the treatment of patients with unresectable metastatic ocular melanoma in the liver 
our nda was accepted for filing by the fda on october  and has been designated for standard review with a prescription drug user fee act pdufa goal date of june  the chemosat melblez kit system administers concentrated regional chemotherapy to the liver 
this whole organ therapy is performed by first isolating the circulatory system of the liver  delivering chemotherapeutic agent  and filtering the blood prior to returning it to the patient 
during the procedure  three catheters are placed percutaneously through standard interventional radiology techniques 
the catheters temporarily isolate the liver from the body s circulatory system  administer a minute infusion of the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan hydrochloride directly to the liver  and collect drug laden blood exiting the liver for filtration by proprietary filters 
the filters reduce the concentration of chemotherapeutic agent in the blood  thereby minimizing systemic exposure to the drug and related toxic side effects before the filtered blood is returned to the patient s circulatory system 
through december   the chemosat melblez kit system has been used on approximately patients through clinical development and early commercial experience in europe 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
delcath has operated at a loss for its entire history and anticipates that losses will continue over the coming year 
there can be no assurance that delcath will ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
the company expects to use cash  cash equivalents and investment proceeds to fund its operating activities 
delcath s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of research and product development programs  obtaining approvals and complying with regulations  the timing and effectiveness of product commercialization activities  including marketing arrangements  the timing and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as compared to cash  cash equivalents and certificates of deposit totaling million at december  during the twelve months ended december   the company used million of cash in its operating activities  which compares to million used for operating activities during the comparable twelve month period in the increase of million is primarily driven by nda submission related costs  expenses related to the company s ongoing commercialization efforts in europe  an increase in compensation related expenses as the company grew from employees at december  to employees at december   and research and development activities  such as the recently approved melphalan generation two and doxorubicin filters 
the company believes it has access to sufficient capital to fund operating activities for the next twelve months 
assuming delcath receives fda approval in  the company anticipates additional resources will be required to support full us commercialization 
because delcath s business does not generate positive cash flow from operating activities  the company will need to raise additional capital in order to fully commercialize the product or to fund development efforts relating to additional indications 
the company believes it will be able to raise additional capital in the event it is in its best interest to do so 
the company anticipates raising such additional capital by either borrowing money  selling shares of delcath s capital stock  or entering into strategic alliances with appropriate partners 
to the extent additional capital is not available when needed  the company may be forced to abandon some or all of its development and commercialization efforts  which would have a material adverse effect on the prospects of our business 
further  the company s assumptions relating to its cash requirements may differ materially from its actual requirements because of a number of factors  including significant unforeseen delays in the regulatory approval process  changes in the focus and direction of clinical trials and costs related to commercializing the product 
the company has funded its operations through a combination of private placements of its securities  public offerings in     and  registered direct offerings in and  and an at the market equity offering program initiated in for a detailed discussion of the company s various sales of securities and the at the market equity offering program see note to the company s audited financial statements contained in this annual report on form k

the company used registration statement for its august and july public offerings and for establishing an at the market equity offering program detailed in note to the company s audited financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
as of december   delcath had approximately million available under this registration statement and intends to use this for its at the market equity offering program 
in december  the company filed a registration statement on form s with the sec  which allowed the company to offer and sell  from time to time in one or more offerings  up to  of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  debt securities and stock purchase contracts as it deemed prudent or necessary to raise capital at a later date 
the registration statement became effective on february  
the company used this registration statement for its may public offering detailed in note to the company s audited financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
the company subsequently filed a new shelf registration statement on form s with the sec which became effective on october  
this new shelf replaces the shelf registration filed in december and allows the company to offer and sell  from time to time in one or more offerings  up to  of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  debt securities and stock purchase contracts as it deems prudent or necessary to raise capital at a later date 
the company used this registration statement for its common stock purchase agreement with terrapin opportunity  lp detailed in note to the company s audited financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
as of december   delcath had approximately million available under this registration statement  of which approximately million is reserved for the potential issuance of shares upon the exercise of warrants 
the company intends to use the net proceeds from any future offerings for general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to  obtaining regulatory approvals  commercialization of its products  funding of clinical trials  capital expenditures and working capital 

table of contents contractual obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company is obligated to make future payments under various operating lease agreements 
the following table provides a summary of significant contractual obligations at december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating activities operating leases our operating lease obligations at december  include the annual rent under the lease for our office space at seventh avenue  new york  new york  which will expire in march  the annual rent under the leases for our facilities in queensbury  new york  which expire in july and june  and the annual rent for our facility in galway  ireland  which will expire in august see part i  item  properties and note to the company s audited financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
future capital needs  additional future funding our future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company has operated at a loss for its entire history and there can be no assurance that it will ever achieve consistent profitability 
the company believes that it has access to adequate resources to fund operations through and anticipates that additional working capital may be required to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that such working capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
results of operations for the year ended december   comparisons of results of the years ended december  and revenue the company recorded the first sales of its chemosat hepatic system in europe during the year ended december   resulting in revenue of million  of which approximately  is deferred until the company fulfills its obligations under the distribution agreement and the distributor is able to ship kits to the centers it anticipates servicing 
cost of goods sold as discussed in note to the company s audited financial statements contained in this annual report on form k  the company did not recognize any cost of goods sold associated with the revenue or deferred revenue reported in the second or third quarters of because a portion of the company s inventory was purchased prior to obtaining authorization to affix the ce mark to its generation two delcath hepatic chemosat delivery system in april  including components used in the kits sold during those periods 
during the year ended december   the company recognized cost of goods sold of approximately  related to kits that are associated with revenue of million 
cost of goods sold of approximately  is associated with the  of deferred revenue  resulting in  deferred net revenue 
as delcath continues to expand its commercialization in europe and other parts of the world  the company expects to see a certain amount of volatility in both the average selling price and gross margin for the next several years 
this volatility will be related to several factors  including the expected use of third party distributors  whose purchase prices will be lower than direct to end user customer prices  the gradual increase in cost of goods sold as the company exhausts raw materials that were purchased and expensed in prior periods and begins to recognize the actual costs of materials  labor and overhead  and an improvement in efficiencies as the company increases its production of the chemosat system 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  a significant portion of the increase is related to the company s expansion  particularly as delcath has continued executing on its commercialization plans by hiring staff for sales and support positions across europe 
this has led to an increase in personnel related expenses  as well as all other expenses related to maintaining an office and supporting employees 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  the company was continuing its transition from a development stage company to a commercial enterprise with staff dedicated to commercializing the chemosat melblez kit system 
the increase in the company s general and administrative expenses corresponded with the initiation of our european commercialization efforts  as well as an increase in staffing in both the united states and europe 

table of contents research and development expenses for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses is primarily related to the training and deployment of third party medical science liaisons in europe  which was partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to the preparation of the nda submission and a reduction in material related expenses that are now accounted for as inventory and  as a result  are capitalized rather than expensed 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses was primarily related to our expanded research and development activities  including work on our generation filter and regulatory expenses related to our submission to the fda 
interest income interest income is from a money market account and interest earned on operating accounts 
for the year ended december   the company had interest income of  as compared to interest income of  for the same period in for the year ended december   the company invested their cash in interest bearing accounts which yielded higher returns than in for the year ended december   the company had interest income of  as compared to interest income of  for the same period in for the year ended december   the company earned interest from certificates of deposit which matured throughout and the first quarter of  yielding lower interest income for the year ended december  other expense and interest expense other expense is primarily related to currency gains and losses 
interest expense is related to the commitment fee paid upon entering into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank svb and an ongoing revolving line facility fee as required by the agreement with svb as discussed in note to the company s audited financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
net loss the company had a net loss for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million  or  compared to the net loss from continuing operations for the same period in this increase is primarily due to a million decrease in the change in the fair value of the warrant liability  which is a non cash expense  and a million increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses reflects a significant increase in costs related to our efforts to commercialize the chemosat melblez kit system  particularly hiring staff for sales and support positions across europe and the related expenses to maintain an office and support employees efforts across europe 
the company had a net loss for the year ended december   of million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the net loss from continuing operations for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to a million increase in the change in the fair value of the warrant liability  a non cash gain  which was offset by a million increase in total operating costs 
the increase in operating expenses reflected a significant increase in costs related to our preparations to commercialize the chemosat melblez kit system  expenses related to our additional safety data collection efforts to prepare our submission to the fda  and an increase in compensation related expenses as the company grew from to employees during the warrants issued in and as part of our sales of common stock are considered to be derivatives and are subject to valuation and adjustment on a quarterly basis see item a  below for a complete description 
this mark to market adjustment of the warrant valuation resulted in the recording of million in derivative instrument income for the year ended december   a million difference from the million of derivative instrument expense recorded in the year ended december  application of critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
certain accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in the financial statements 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in note to the company s audited financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
during  delcath transitioned from a development stage company to a commercialization organization 
at this early commercial stage  the company has limited choices among accounting policies or methods 
in many cases  the company must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under gaap 
additionally  the company devotes substantial resources to obtaining regulatory approvals for the chemosat melblez kit system as well as its research and development activities  the cost of which is required to be charged to expense as incurred 
this further limits the company s choice of accounting policies and methods 
similarly  management believes there are very limited circumstances in which the company s financial statement estimates are significant or critical 

table of contents the company considers the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets to be a significant accounting estimate 
in applying asc management estimates future taxable income from operations and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
management believes the company does not have any uncertain tax positions 
the company has adopted the provisions of asc  which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of asc  share based compensation is measured at the grant date  based upon the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the option holders requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
the company expenses its share based compensation under the ratable method  which treats each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant 
the company has adopted the provisions of asc  which establishes accounting for equity based payments to non employees 
measurement of compensation cost related to common shares issued to non employees for services is based on the value of the services provided or the fair value of the shares issued 
each transaction is reviewed to determine the more reliably measurable basis for the valuation 
the measurement of non employee stock based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instrument vests 
non employee stock based compensation charges are amortized over the vesting period or period of performance of the services 
the company has adopted the provisions of asc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  asc establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
see note to the company s audited financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for assets and liabilities the company has evaluated under asc item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company may be exposed to market risk through changes in market interest rates that could affect the interest earned on its cash balances 
the company measures all derivatives  including certain derivatives embedded in contracts  at fair value and recognizes them on the balance sheet as an asset or a liability  depending on the company s rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
in may  the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock and the issuance of warrants to purchase  common shares the warrants pursuant to an underwriting agreement 
the company received proceeds of million  with net cash proceeds after related expenses from this transaction of approximately million 
of those proceeds  the company allocated an estimated fair value of million to the warrants 
the fair value of the warrants on may  was determined by using an option pricing model assuming a risk free interest rate of  volatility of and an expected life equal to the contractual life of the warrants may 
as required by the warrant agreement  the exercise price of the warrants was adjusted following the company s december sale of common stock 
at december   the warrants were exercisable at per share with  warrants outstanding 
the warrants have a three year term 
the shares and warrants were issued pursuant to an effective registration statement on form s 
table of contents in june  the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock and the issuance of warrants to purchase  common shares the warrants pursuant to a subscription agreement with a single investor 
the company received proceeds of million  with net cash proceeds after related expenses from this transaction of approximately million 
of those proceeds  the company allocated an estimated fair value of million to the warrant liability 
the fair value of the warrants on june  was determined by using an option pricing model assuming a risk free interest rate of  volatility of and an expected life equal to the contractual life of the warrants june 
as required by the warrant agreement  the exercise price of the warrants was adjusted following the company s december sale of common stock 
at december   the warrants were exercisable at per share with  shares outstanding 
the warrants have a five year term 
in september  the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock and the issuance of warrants to purchase  common shares the warrants in a private placement to institutional and accredited investors 
the company received net proceeds of million in this transaction 
the company allocated million of the total proceeds to the warrants 
following the company s may  sale of common stock and warrants  the warrants were exercisable at per share with  warrants outstanding 
the warrants expired on september  approximately million warrants were exercised during the quarter ended september  the remaining liability after the warrant exercises was credited to pre tax derivative instrument income 
the million in proceeds allocated to the warrants and the million in proceeds allocated to the warrants are classified as derivative instrument liabilities 
the terms of the warrants provide for potential adjustment in the exercise price and are therefore considered to be derivative instrument liabilities that are subject to mark to market adjustment each period 
as a result  for the twelve month period ended december   the company recorded pre tax derivative instrument income of million 
the resulting derivative instrument liabilities totaled million at december  management expects that the warrants will either be exercised or expire worthless 
the fair value of the warrants at december  was determined by using an option pricing model assuming the following warrants warrants expected volatility risk free interest rates expected life in years
