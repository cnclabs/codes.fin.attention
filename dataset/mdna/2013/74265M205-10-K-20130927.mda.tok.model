item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition for the years ended june  and unless otherwise indicated  this discussion excludes the results of our fractional horsepower motor product line  operating under the name pro dex astromec  which we sold in february and which has been classified as a discontinued operation 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto beginning on page of this report 
this report contains certain forward looking statements and information 
the cautionary statements included below and elsewhere in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they may appear 
our actual future results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customer when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer and all other conditions required by gaap  as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb in accounting standards codification asc section formerly staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  have been satisfied 
revenue from billable product development service portions of development and supply contracts is generally recognized upon completion of such product development services  in conformity with asc section anticipated losses on product development services are charged to cost of sales in the period in which such losses become probable 
returns of our product for credit are minimal  accordingly  we do not establish a reserve for product returns at the time of sale 
warranties certain of our products are sold with a warranty that provides for repairs or replacement of any defective parts for a period  generally one year  after the sale 
at the time of the sale  we accrue an estimate of the cost of providing the warranty based on prior experience with such factors as return rates and repair costs  which factors are reviewed quarterly 
warranty expenses  including changes of estimates  are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
pro dex annual report 
table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
reductions to estimated market value are recorded  and charged to cost of sales  when indicated based on a formula that compares on hand quantities to estimated demand over the ensuing months from the measurement date 
accounts receivable trade receivables are stated at their original invoice amounts  less an allowance for doubtful portions of such accounts 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on facts and circumstances related to specific accounts  and on historical experience related to the age of accounts 
trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade receivables previously reserved are offset against the allowance when received 
investments investments consist of marketable equity securities of publicly held companies 
management intends to hold such securities for a sufficient period in which to realize a reasonable return  although there is no assurance that positive returns will be realized or that such securities will not be liquidated in a shorter than expected time frame to accommodate the company s liquidity requirements 
accordingly  investments have been classified as non current and available for sale in conformity with asc section investments are marked to market at each measurement date  with unrealized gains and losses presented as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
long lived assets and real estate held for sale we review the recoverability of long lived assets  consisting of equipment and leasehold improvements  and of real estate held for sale  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate carrying values may not be recoverable 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors 
the fair value of share based awards is estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period using the straight line single option method 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and projected employee stock option exercise behavior 
we estimate stock price volatility based on two factors a the measurement date typically the grant date and b the expected life of the option  which we calculate using the staff accounting bulletin no 
simplified method 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
deferred tax assets at both june  and consisted primarily of basis differences related to research and development tax credit utilization  net operating loss carryovers  intangible assets  accrued expenses and inventories 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
such determination is based on our historical taxable income  with consideration given to our estimates of future taxable income and the periods over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  the provision for income taxes will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
at june  and  we maintained a valuation allowance against the entire balance of our deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities

table of contents results of operations results of operations for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  the following table sets forth financial data and the percentage of net sales regarding our financial position and operating results fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses research and development costs loss from continuing operations before items below interest expense  net benefit from income taxes loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net loss net sales in decreased  or million  to million from million in contributing to this decrease was a reduction  amounting to million  in product sales and repair services to our former largest medical device customer  partially offset by an increase of  to our current second largest customer and a net increase of million in product sales and repair services to other medical device customers as compared to additionally  sales in our dental and industrial product lines decreased  and  respectively  in as compared to due primarily to a increased focus in of our resources in  relative to  on development of medical device product sales 
although selective price increases were implemented during in response to market conditions  the primary factor underlying the medical device sales increases excluding sales to our former largest customer described above is unit volume change 
at june   we had a backlog of million compared with a backlog of million at june  the increase in orders is due to normal variability in our new order bookings 
gross profit in decreased million  or  to million from million in contributing to this descrease was million resulting from the reduced sales volume described above and the accrual in of  representing anticipated losses from the development services portion of certain contracts 
partially offsetting these changes was a  reduction in warranty costs in  relative to as a percentage of sales  gross margin was for  as compared to in underlying this result was the accrual in of the anticipated contract losses  partially offset by the favorable changes in warranty costs  both as described above 
selling expenses decreased  or  to million in from million in this decrease is attributable primarily to decreases in a advertising and market research expenses of  and b tradeshow expense of  partially offset by an increase in severance expense of  from to general and administrative expenses decreased  or  to million in from million in  due to a the lower costs incurred in  relative to  related to changes in each such year of chief executive officers  such costs amounting to  and  in and  respectively  b a decrease in compensation expense of  and c a decrease in professional consulting and legal expense excluding proxy contest expenses discussed below of  partially offsetting these decreases were increases in legal and shareholder reporting expenses  aggregating  incurred in connection with proxy contest expenses related to the contested election of directors at our annual meeting of shareholders held in january pro dex annual report 
table of contents research and development costs  which include costs related to development of new products and enhancements to existing products  decreased  or  to million in from million in this decrease was due primarily to the deployment of engineering resources  normally charged to research and development expense  to support revenue producing development contracts with customers  the costs of which are deferred  and recorded as cost of sales when the development projects are completed 
such deferred costs amounted to  in and  in partially offsetting the effect of these deferred costs was an increase in departmental compensation of  in compared to interest income in was  due to the investment of a portion of our cash balances in money market funds in june there was no interest income in interest expense was  in  compared to  in this decrease was attributable to our repayment  in september  of the entire principal balance  amounting to  of the then outstanding term loan see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
our effective combined federal and state tax benefit rate in was  as compared to a tax benefit rate in of 
the decrease in rates from to is due to the ability  in  to carry back a substantial portion of net operating losses to offset taxable income in prior years  fully utilizing our loss carryback capacity 
accordingly  the net operating losses generated in may be used only to offset future years taxable income 
there is no assurance  however  that we will generate sufficient  or any  taxable income in future years to utilize such net operating loss carryforward capacity 
because we were not able to utilize the entire amount of net operating losses generated in either or to offset taxable income  the tax benefit rates in both years were lower than the federal statutory rate see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
as a result of the foregoing  loss from continuing operations for was million  as compared to a loss from continuing operations of  for liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial information as of june  and june  june  cash working capital current assets  less current liabilities cash  net of debt net cash used in operating activities in amounted to million 
the primary use of cash arose from an increase in a unbilled receivables amouting to  and relating to the development portion of certain contracts we entered into with customers in  and b inventories of million  resulting primarily from a build up of our stock of components related to certain of our products with the objective of shortening lead times when forecasted purchase orders are received 
in the fourth quarter of  our largest customer began deferring the timing of its product orders  thus prolonging the effect of the inventory build up described above with respect to inventory unique to that customer s products 
based on discussions with the customer  we believe that partial relief of the inventory build up related to that customer s products will likely be weighted toward the latter half of fiscal and possibly the first half of fiscal sources of cash arose primarily from reductions in a accounts receivable amounting to  attributable primarily to the lower sales volume experienced during relative to  and b income taxes receivable amounting to  resulting primarily from tax refunds received in from the carryback of tax basis net operating losses generated in  and from increases in a accrued expenses  resulting primarily from the accrual in of anticipated losses on development contracts amounting to  and b deferred revenue amounting to  resulting from collections received in from customers in connection with the contractual terms of development contracts that will not qualify for revenue recognition until we complete the related non recurring engineering services 
during  net cash provided by operating activities amounted to  sources of cash arose from increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  amounting to  and due primarily to high ordering activity relative to sales volumes and accruals for employee bonuses related to results 
uses of cash arose from increases in accounts receivable of  and inventories of  both increases due primarily to the high sales volumes during net cash used in investing activities during consisted primarily of investments  aggregating  in common stock of public companies under the direction of the investment committee of our board see surplus capital investment policy below  and of purchases of equipment amounting to  net cash used in investing activities during consisted of purchases of equipment  amounting to  net of proceeds received  amounting to  from the sale of equipment in connection with the sale of the astromec business see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report

table of contents net cash used in financing activities for consisted primarily of a our payment  in september  of the remaining balance due  amounting to  on the union bank term loan  fully retiring such indebtedness see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report  and b normal reductions in the principal balance of the bank term loan  prior to the repayment described above  of  partially offset by  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities during consisted primarily of reductions in the principal balance of our bank term loan  amounting to  we believe that existing cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months 
reduction in large customer orders in december  our then largest customer informed us that it was in the process of developing  and planned to eventually manufacture  its own surgical devices which were functionally comparable to the products we provided to the customer at that time 
we had been the exclusive manufacturer of these products since they were developed 
the resulting reduction in orders from our largest customer and its expected future impact on our business is more fully described in description of business under item of this report 
reduction in directors compensation at our annual meeting of shareholders held on january   our shareholders elected four new members to our board of directors 
at a meeting of the newly constituted board on february   three of those newly elected directors  messrs 
swenson  cabillot and farrell  each opted to waive  through the date of our annual meeting of shareholders  a receipt of stock options they were otherwise entitled to receive under the provisions of the directors compensation plan then in effect the plan  and b any cash retainers or meeting fees they were otherwise entitled to receive under the plan in excess of per meeting and  per year 
at its meeting on may   our board replaced the plan with the directors compensation plan the plan that provides for the following fees of for participation in board or committee meetings  to a maximum of  per fiscal year  an annual retainer of  for the audit committee chair which may be modified in compensating any future audit committee chair 
the plan has no provision for a retainers other than that described above  or b grants of options  restricted stock or other equity or equity based compensation or incentives see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
we believe that  when compared to the plan  the plan will result in a reduction of directors cash compensation on an annualized basis of approximately  and in a reduction of aggregate cash and non cash directors compensation expense on an annualized basis of approximately  sale of real estate on july   we completed the sale of the land and building constituting the facility in which astromec formerly operated in carson city  nevada see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the sale price for the facility was  which  after approximately  in deductions for sale related expenses such as commissions and fees  resulted in our receipt of net proceeds of approximately  the facility was not encumbered by any debt

table of contents in june  the investment committee approved investments aggregating  and approved an additional  in july at september    was invested in marketable public equity securities  having a market value of  and  was invested in money market funds 
in september  our board approved a share repurchase program authorizing the company  at the direction of the investment committee  to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock under parameters to be determined by the investment committee 
the repurchase program has no stated expiration date 
changes in bank debt and credit facilities as discussed above in liquidity and capital resources under this item  on august  we notified the bank with whom we had a then existing bank credit facility of our intent to terminate the credit facility agreements and repay the term loan outstanding thereunder  which was repaid in september impact of inflation and changing prices the industries in which we compete are labor intensive  often involving personnel with high level technical or sales skills 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in the marketplace occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have been able to partially offset increases in operating costs by increasing prices  expanding services and implementing cost control measures 
however  our ability to increase prices is limited by competitive market conditions  including international competition in many of our markets 
recent accounting pronouncements we evaluate authoritative accounting pronouncements upon their issuance and estimate the effect  if any  of such pronouncements on our financial statements 
in our evaluation  we have concluded that there are no such pronouncements that have been issued with effective dates subsequent to june  that would have an effect on our financial statements or accounting policies had such pronouncements been currently in effect
