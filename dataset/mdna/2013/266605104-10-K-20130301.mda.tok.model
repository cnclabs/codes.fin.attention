these forward looking statements reflect our view only as of the date of this report 
we undertake no obligations to update any forward looking statements 
you should also carefully consider the factors set forth in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary drug delivery technology platforms 
our product pipeline currently consists of seven investigational drug candidates in clinical development  with one program the subject of a new drug application nda with the us food and drug administration fda for which a complete response letter was received in june  one program in phase iii with a nda in preparation  two programs in phase ii and three programs in phase i 
the more advanced programs are in the field of pain management and we believe that each of these targets large market opportunities with product features that are differentiated from existing therapeutics 
we have other programs underway in fields outside of pain management  including several efforts underway which seek to improve the administration of biotechnology agents such as proteins and peptides 
a central aspect of our business strategy involves advancing multiple product candidates at one time  which is enabled by leveraging our resources with those of corporate collaborators 
thus  certain of our programs are currently licensed to corporate collaborators on terms which typically call for our collaborator to fund all or a substantial portion of future development costs and then pay us milestone payments based on specific development or commercial achievements plus a royalty on product sales 
at the same time  we have retained the rights to other programs  which are the basis of future collaborations and which over time may provide a pathway for us to develop our own commercial  sales and marketing organization 
collaborative research and development and other revenues collaborative research and development and other revenues consist of three broad categories a the recognition of upfront license payments on a straight line basis over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party  b the reimbursement of qualified research expenses by third parties and c milestone payments in connection with our collaborative agreements 
during the last several years  we generated collaborative research and development revenues from collaborative agreements with pain therapeutics  pfizer king  hospira  nycomed  zogenix  and others 

table of contents product revenues we have historically generated product revenue from the sale of three product lines alzet osmotic pumps for animal research use  lactel biodegradable polymers which are used by our customers as raw materials in their pharmaceutical and medical products  and certain key excipients that are included in remoxy 
in the future  we expect to generate modest revenue related to an animal health product which was approved and launched by our licensee in because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines 
however  we expect that we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenue related to collaborative research and development by entering into additional research and development agreements with third party collaborators to develop product candidates based on our drug delivery technologies 
reduction in force in february  we reduced the size of our workforce by employees or approximately of our headcount 
we substantially completed this headcount reduction during february  and incurred approximately  in severance costs for the impacted employees in the first quarter of the goal of this action was to better align our cost structure with anticipated revenues and operating expenses  while not compromising our key corporate objectives 
operating results since our inception in  we have generally had a history of operating losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
while we did generate net income of million for the year ended december  related to the termination of certain of our collaboration agreements  we have incurred operating losses in other years 
our net losses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our product candidates and to a lesser extent  from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales 
we expect our research and development expenses to decrease in compared to we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to be comparable in compared to we do not anticipate meaningful revenues from our pharmaceutical systems  should they be approved  for at least the next twelve months 
therefore  we expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued liabilities  contract research liabilities  inventories and stock based compensation 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we enter into license and collaboration agreements under which we may receive upfront license fees  research funding and contingent milestone payments and royalties 
we evaluate the accounting treatment under 
table of contents these agreements including whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
for our collaborations with multiple deliverables  we have concluded that the deliverables are not separable and the arrangements should be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting 
as a combined unit of accounting we recognized the consideration for the combined unit of accounting in the same manner as the revenue was recognized for the final deliverable  which was generally ratably over the longest period of involvement 
for example  upfront payments received upon execution of collaborative agreements are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as collaborative research and development revenue based on a straight line basis over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement 
such period generally represents the longer of the estimated research and development period or other continuing obligation period defined in the respective agreements between us and our third party collaborators 
if we determine that the expected timeline for a project and therefore our continuing involvement is materially different than we previously assumed  we will adjust the period over which we recognize the deferred revenue 
in the first quarter of  we were notified by hospira  pfizer  and nycomed that they were terminating certain license and collaboration agreements 
as a result  the related deferred revenue from up front payments for those license and collaboration agreements was recognized as revenue during as our performance obligations were relieved 
during  we recognized million from the recognition of deferred revenue related to terminated license and collaboration agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and other compensation cost associated with research and development personnel  overhead and facility costs  preclinical and non clinical development costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs paid to third parties under sponsored research agreements are recognized as expense as the related services are performed  generally ratably over the period of service 
in addition  net reimbursements of research and development expenses by our partners incurred are recorded as collaborative research and development revenue 
net payments of research and development expenses to our partners are recorded as an addition to our research and development expenses in the period incurred 
goodwill we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies and intellectual property rights 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
goodwill is periodically assessed for impairment 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the company operates in one operating segment and one reporting unit  which is the research  development and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products 
we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  new information affecting the commercial value of the asset  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents if we determine that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we would also reconcile our estimate of total enterprise value to our market capitalization 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill was approximately million 
no impairment of goodwill has been recorded through december  however  there can be no assurance that at the time other periodic reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities we incur significant costs associated with third party consultants and organizations for pre clinical studies  clinical trials  contract manufacturing  validation  testing  and other research and development related services 
we are required to estimate periodically the cost of services rendered but unbilled based on management s estimates of project status 
if these good faith estimates are inaccurate  actual expenses incurred could materially differ from our estimates 
inventories inventories include certain excipients that are sold to a customer and included in products awaiting regulatory approval 
these inventories are capitalized based on management s judgment of probable sale prior to their expiration date which in turn is primarily based on non binding forecasts from our customer as well as management s internal estimates 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate the value of inventory that may become expired prior to use 
we may be required to expense previously capitalized inventory costs upon a change in our judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or delay of approval of our customer s product by the necessary regulatory bodies  or new information that suggests that the inventory will not be saleable 
in addition  these circumstances may cause us to record a liability related to minimum purchase agreements that we have in place for raw materials 
as of december   we had million in inventory related to excipients that are included in remoxy and other programs 
in addition  we have future purchase commitments totaling  per year through in the event that we determine that we will not utilize all of these materials  there could be a potential write off related to this inventory and a reserve for future purchase commitments 
stock based compensation employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite period 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
we base the risk free rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted before january   we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted on or after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december   and collaborative research and development and other revenue we recognize revenues from collaborative research and development activities and service contracts 
collaborative research and development revenue primarily represents net reimbursement of qualified expenses related to the collaborative agreements with various third parties to research  develop and commercialize potential products using our drug delivery technologies  revenue recognized from ratable recognition of upfront fees and milestone payments in connection with our collaborative agreements 
we expect our collaborative research and development revenue to fluctuate in future periods pending our efforts to enter into potential new collaborations and our existing third party collaborators commitment to and progress in the research and development programs 
the collaborative research and development and other revenues associated with our major collaborators are as follows in thousands year ended december  collaborator hospira inc hospira pfizer inc pfizer nycomed danmark aps nycomed zogenix  inc zogenix pain therapeutics  inc pain therapeutics others total collaborative research and development and other revenue amounts related to ratable recognition of upfront fees were million in  million in and million in in march  we were notified that hospira was terminating the development and license agreement between hospira and us dated june  relating to the development and commercialization of posidur in the united states and canada 
as a result  we recognized as revenue all of the remaining upfront fees in that had previously been deferred 
amounts related to ratable recognition of upfront fees were million in  million in and million in in february  pfizer acquired king and thereby assumed the rights and obligations of king under the agreements we formerly had in place with king  accordingly amounts attributed to king are now shown as pfizer figures 
in february  we were notified that pfizer was terminating the worldwide development and license agreement between alpharma acquired by king which subsequently was acquired by pfizer and us dated september  relating to the development and commercialization of eladur 
as a result  we recognized as revenue all of the remaining upfront fees in that had previously been deferred 
amounts related to ratable recognition of upfront fees were million in  million in and in october  takeda pharmaceutical company limited acquired nycomed and thereby assumed the rights and obligations of nycomed under the agreements we formerly had in place with nycomed 
in january  we were notified that nycomed was terminating the development and license agreement between nycomed and us dated november   as amended  relating to the development and commercialization of posidur saber bupivacaine in europe and their other licensed territories 
as a result  we recognized as revenue all of the remaining upfront fees in that had previously been deferred 
amounts related to ratable recognition of upfront fees were  in   in  and zero in a development and license agreement with zogenix was entered into in july  we and zogenix had previously been working together under a feasibility agreement pursuant to which our research and development costs were reimbursed by zogenix 

table of contents we recorded million  million and million of collaborative research and development revenue in  and  respectively 
the increase in collaborative research and development revenue in compared with was primarily attributable to revenue of million recognized as a result of the termination of our agreements with nycomed with respect to posidur  pfizer with respect to eladur and hospira with respect to posidur in the first quarter of  the termination of the agreements and the related recognition of deferred revenue did not result in additional cash proceeds to us 
excluding the impact of recognition of the upfront fees from our agreements with collaborative partners in and  collaborative research and development revenue decreased in due to lower revenue recognized from our agreements with hospira  pfizer with respect to eladur and zogenix as the development activities for posidur  eladur  relday and other feasibility partners decreased in compared with  partially offset by higher collaborative research and development revenue recognized in connection with our agreements with pfizer with respect to remoxy in the increase in collaborative research and development revenue in compared with was primarily attributable to higher revenue recognized in connection with our agreements with  hospira  zogenix and other feasibility partners  partially offset by lower collaborative research and development revenue from pfizer  nycomed and pain therapeutics 
we received a million upfront fee in connection with the development and license agreement signed with zogenix in july relating to relday 
the million upfront fee is recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with zogenix with respect to relday 
at december    of the million upfront fee had been recognized as revenue 
we also received a million upfront fee in connection with the development and license agreement signed with hospira in june relating to posidur 
the million upfront fee had been recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with hospira with respect to posidur 
our estimate of the remaining term of our continuing involvement was revised in the first quarter of as a result of hospira s termination notice received by us in march at december   all of the million upfront fee had been recognized as revenue 
we also received a million upfront fee in connection with the development and license agreement signed with alpharma acquired by king which was subsequently acquired by pfizer in september relating to eladur 
the million upfront fee had been recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with alpharma with respect to eladur 
our estimate of the remaining term of our continuing involvement was revised in the first quarter of as a result of pfizer s termination notice received by us in february at december   all of the million upfront fee had been recognized as revenue 
we also received a million upfront fee in connection with the development and license agreement signed with nycomed in november relating to posidur 
the million upfront fee had been recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with nycomed with respect to posidur 
our estimate of the remaining term of our continuing involvement was revised in the first quarter of as a result of nycomed s termination notice received by us in january at december   all of the million upfront fee had been recognized as revenue 
product revenue a portion of our revenues is derived from our product sales  which include our alzet mini pump product line  our lactel biodegradable polymer product line and certain excipients that are included in remoxy 
net product revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents the decrease in product revenue in compared to was primarily attributable to lower product revenue from the sale of certain excipients included in remoxy to pfizer and from our alzet mini pump product line as a result of fewer units sold  partially offset by higher product revenue from our lactel polymer product line due to higher units sold compared to revenues in included  in product revenue related to the shipments of excipients included in remoxy  compared to  in the decrease in product revenue in compared to was primarily attributable to lower product revenue from the sale of certain excipients included in remoxy and our lactel polymer product line as a result of lower units sold  partially offset by higher product revenue from our alzet mini pump product line as a result of higher selling prices compared to product revenues in included  of product revenue related to the shipments of excipients included in remoxy

cost of product revenues include the cost of product revenue from our alzet product line  our lactel product line and certain excipients that are included in remoxy 
the cost of product revenue in and was comparable primarily due to lower cost of goods sold related to the sale of certain excipients to pfizer and related to our alzet product line arising from lower units sold  partially offset by the result of higher manufacturing costs associated with our lactel product line due to higher units sold in compared to cost of product revenue and gross profit margin will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the product mix in a particular period 
the increase in the cost of product revenue in compared to was primarily the result of higher manufacturing costs associated with our alzet product line  partially offset by lower units sold from our lactel product line and slightly lower cost of goods sold associated with the sale of certain excipients for remoxy 
cost of product revenue and gross profit margin will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the product mix in a particular period 
stock based compensation expense recognized related to cost of product revenues was   and  in  and  respectively 
as of december   and  we had  and manufacturing employees  respectively 
as of february   we had employees in manufacturing  which we expect will remain comparable in the near future 
research and development 
research and development expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and other compensation cost associated with research and development personnel  overhead and facility costs  preclinical and non clinical development costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and stock based compensation expense recognized related to research and development personnel was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses decreased by million in compared to the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower development costs associated with posidur  depot injectable programs  remoxy  relday  oradur adhd  transdur sufentanil and eladur  partially offset by higher development costs associated with other research programs compared to as more fully discussed below 

table of contents research and development expenses decreased by million in compared to the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower development costs associated with our depot injectable programs  remoxy  oradur adhd  transdur sufentanil  eladur  and other research programs  partially offset by higher development costs associated with posidur and relday compared to as more fully discussed below 
research and development expenses associated with our major development programs are as follows in thousands year ended december  posidur depot injectable programs remoxy and other oradur based opioid products relday oradur adhd transdur sufentanil eladur others total research and development expenses see note strategic agreements in the financial statements for more details about our agreements with hospira  nycomed  pfizer  pain therapeutics  zogenix and endo 
posidur our research and development expenses for posidur decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower clinical trial expenses related to posidur in as we largely completed the phase iii clinical study for posidur in the fourth quarter of our research and development expenses for posidur increased to million in from million in  primarily due to higher costs associated with our phase iii clinical trial and higher employee related costs for posidur compared to depot injectable programs our research and development expenses for depot injectable programs decreased to million in from million in primarily due to lower employee related costs and lower external costs for these programs in compared to our research and development expenses for depot injectable programs decreased to million in from million in primarily due to lower employee related costs and lower external costs for these programs in compared to remoxy and other oradur based opioid products our research and development expenses for remoxy and other oradur based opioids decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to decreased development support activities for remoxy in our research and development expenses for remoxy and other oradur based opioids decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to decreased activities to support the resubmission of the remoxy nda which occurred in december 
table of contents relday our research and development expenses for relday decreased to million in from million in primarily due to decreased formulation development activities and non clinical studies associated with relday as zogenix filed an ind for relday in the second quarter of our research and development expenses for relday increased to million in from  in primarily due to higher employee related cost as well as higher costs related to formulation development and non clinical studies associated with relday in compared with oradur adhd our research and development expenses for oradur adhd decreased to  in from million in  primarily due to lower employee related costs incurred for this program 
our research and development expenses for oradur adhd decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower employee related costs incurred for this program in transdur sufentanil our research and development expenses for transdur sufentanil decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to decreased external costs and employee related costs for this drug candidate in compared with our research and development expenses for transdur sufentanil decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to decreased external costs and employee related costs for this drug candidate in compared with eladur our research and development expenses for eladur decreased to  in from million in  primarily due to lower employee related costs  non clinical studies and contract manufacturing expenses related to this drug candidate 
our research and development expenses for eladur decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower employee related costs and lower contract manufacturing expenses related to this product candidate 
other durect research programs our research and development expenses for all other activities increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased contract research costs and higher employee related costs for these research programs in compared with our research and development expenses for all other activities decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower employee related costs and decreased formulation and development activities for these programs 
as of december   and  we had  and research and development employees respectively 
as of february   we had employees in research and development  which we expect will remain comparable in the near future 
we expect research and development expenses to decrease in compared to 
table of contents we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and costs of our research and development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical systems as outlined in the risk factors section of this report 
the duration of development of our research and development programs may span as many as ten years or more  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainties of future preclinical and clinical study results  the uncertainties with our collaborators commitment to and progress in the programs and the uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as sales and marketing 
in addition  with respect to our development programs subject to third party collaborations  the timing and expenditures to complete the programs are subject to the control of our collaborators 
therefore  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the research and development programs 
for additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties  see risk factors above 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation associated with finance  legal  business development  sales and marketing and other administrative personnel  overhead and facility costs  and other general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense recognized related to selling  general and administrative personnel was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million in compared to  due to lower stock based compensation expenses related to selling  general and administrative personnel as well as lower other employee related costs and patent related expenses incurred in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million in compared to  due to lower stock based compensation expenses related to selling  general and administrative personnel as well as lower employee related costs and patent related expenses incurred in compared to as of december   and  we had  and selling  general and administrative personnel  respectively 
as of february   we had employees in selling  general and administrative  which we expect will remain comparable in the near future 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to be comparable in compared to other income expense 
interest and other income was   and  in  and  respectively 
in  we received grants totaling  under the patient protection and affordable care act of for three qualifying therapeutic discovery projects in the fourth quarter of we did not receive any grants in or interest and other expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through  and federal research and development tax credits of approximately million  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
as of december   we had nol carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through  and state research and development tax credits of approximately million  which do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to federal and state ownership change limitations 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the 
table of contents amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
because realization of such tax benefits is uncertain  we provided a valuation allowance as of december  and utilization of the nol and r d credits carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by sections and of the internal revenue code of  as well as similar state and foreign provisions 
these ownership changes may limit the amount of nol and r d credits carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax  respectively 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
since our formation  we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions which  combined with the purchasing shareholders subsequent disposition of those shares  may have resulted in a change of control  as defined by section  or could result in a change of control in the future upon subsequent disposition 
in addition  we issued million of convertible notes in and subsequently all of these notes had been converted as of december  into our common stock 
we also issued approximately million shares of our common stock to an institutional investor in connection with an equity financing in september in december  we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement 
these transactions may also have resulted in a change of control as defined by section or could result in a change of control in the future upon the subsequent disposition of the shares 
we have not currently completed a study to assess whether a change in control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since our formation due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study and the fact that there could be additional changes in the future 
if we have experienced a change of control at any time since our formation  utilization of our nol or r d credits carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under sections and which is determined by first multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate  and then could be subject to additional adjustments  as required 
any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of our nol or r d credits carryforwards before utilization 
tax years to remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
this includes  and  of interest bearing marketable securities classified as restricted investments on our balance sheet as of december  and  respectively  which primarily serve as collateral for letters of credit securing our leased facilities in alabama and california 
the letter of credit for our leased facility in alabama will expire in july and the letter of credit for our leased facility in california expired in the first quarter of we used million and million cash in operating activities in the year ended december  and  respectively  and received million of cash in operating activities in the year ended december  the cash used for operations was primarily to fund operations as well as our working capital requirements 
our cash used in operating activities differs from our net income loss primarily due to the timing and recognition of up front payments under collaborative agreements 
upfront payments received upon execution of collaborative agreements are recorded as deferred revenue and generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement 
the net income of million in was largely a result of the accelerated recognition of million in deferred revenue associated with up front fees previously received from terminated collaboration agreements  
table of contents such revenue is non recurring and has no cash flow impact on our financial statements in the decrease in cash used for operations was mainly attributable to the increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by the decrease in contract research liability and deferred revenue in compared to the increase in cash used in operations in compared with was primarily attributable to the increases in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts receivable  offset by the decreases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue in compared with we generated million and million of cash from investing activities in the years ended december  and  respectively  but used million of cash in investing activities in the year ended december  the decrease in cash received from investing activities in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from maturities of available for sale securities  partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment for in compared to the increase in cash generated from investing activities in compared to was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from maturities of available for sale securities  partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment in compared to we anticipate incurring capital expenditures of approximately  over the next months 
the actual amount and timing of other capital expenditures will depend  among other things  on the success of clinical trials for our product candidates and our collaborative research and development activities 
we generated million  million and  million of cash from financing activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in compared to was primarily due to approximately million of cash received from an equity financing in  partially offset by lower proceeds from exercises of stock options in compared to the increase in cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to higher proceeds from exercises of stock options compared with in may  we filed a new shelf registration statement on form s with the sec  which upon being declared effective in may  allowed us to offer up to million of securities from time to time in one or more public offerings of our common stock 
in december  we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
cash used in our operating activities is heavily influenced by the timing and structure of new corporate collaborations 
while one feature of our business strategy is seeking new corporate collaborations  assuming no new collaborations and no milestone payments  we anticipate that cash used in operating activities will increase in the near term as a higher proportion of our research and development efforts are self funded rather than covered by collaborative partners 
in aggregate  we are required to make future payments pursuant to our existing contractual obligations as follows in thousands contractual obligations and thereafter total capital lease purchase commitments operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations includes principal and interest payments 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  existing debt and contractual commitments and planned capital expenditures through at least the next months 
we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
additionally  we do not expect to generate significant revenues from our pharmaceutical 
table of contents systems currently under development for at least the next twelve months  if at all 
depending on whether we enter into additional collaborative agreements in the near term and the extent to which we earn milestone revenues  we may be required to raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity markets  private equity financings  collaborative arrangements  and or public or private debt 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into additional collaborative agreements in the near term  will earn milestone revenues or additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not utilized off balance sheet arrangements to fund our operations or otherwise manage our financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall and floating rate borrowings may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities and corporate bonds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objectives 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio is composed of investments with original maturities of one year or less and approximately of our investment portfolio matures less than days from the date of purchase
