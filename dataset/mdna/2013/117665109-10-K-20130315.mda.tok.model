davidson trust company on may   the acquisition of davidson trust company dtc by the corporation was completed 
the transaction was accounted for as a business combination 
the acquisition of dtc initially increased the corporation s wealth management division assets under management by billion 
the structure of the corporation s existing wealth management segment allowed for the immediate integration of dtc and was able to take advantage of the various synergies that exist between the two companies 
the private wealth management group of the hershey trust company on may   the acquisition of the private wealth management group of the hershey trust company pwmg by the corporation was completed 
the transaction was accounted for as a business combination 
the acquisition of pwmg initially increased the corporation s wealth management division assets under management by billion 
the acquisition of pwmg allowed the corporation to establish a presence in central pennsylvania by maintaining the former pwmg offices in hershey  pennsylvania 
first keystone financial  inc on july   the merger of first keystone financial  inc fkf with and into the corporation  and the two step merger of fkf s wholly owned subsidiary  first keystone bank with and into the bank  were completed

by expanding into these new areas within delaware county  pennsylvania  the corporation has been able to extend its successful sales culture as well as offer its reputable wealth management products and other value added services to a wider segment of the region s population 
results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the results of operations  capital resources and liquidity presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s consolidated financial condition and results of operations are comprised primarily of the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
current performance does not guarantee  and may not be indicative of  similar performance in the future 
for more information on the factors that could affect performance  see special cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements on page of this item 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the corporation and its subsidiaries conform to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
all inter company transactions are eliminated in consolidation and certain reclassifications are made when necessary in order to conform the previous years financial statements to the current year s presentation 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenditures for the periods presented 
therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by the corporation to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
the corporation s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  expected loan commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases  value of collateral  estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from the corporation s estimates  additional provision for loan and lease losses the provision may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
see the section of this document titled asset quality and analysis of credit risk for additional information 
other significant accounting policies are presented in note in the accompanying financial statements 
the corporation s summary of significant accounting policies has not substantively changed any aspect of its overall approach in the application of the foregoing policies 
overview of general economic  regulatory and governmental environment despite the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of the nation s remaining budgetary agreement  the general economic outlook is showing slow but steady improvement 
unemployment rates are moving lower and consumer balance sheets have improved to a level of quality not seen since the early s 
debt levels have been reduced and asset levels recouped much of the losses from the great recession 
throughout the last four years  consumers have reduced the amount of disposable personal income that has been committed to meeting total financial obligations auto  mortgage  insurance and taxes from a historically high level of to slightly below representing the healthiest level in more than years 
the housing market has been showing a gradual improvement over the last few quarters  as measured by new building permits as well as an improvement in new and existing home sales 
this improvement has occurred amid a favorable backdrop of historically low mortgage rates 
in addition to the forecasted improvement in the housing market  consumer spending on durable goods should also show a marked improvement as we move through the year 
improvement in consumers balance sheets has been met by a banking industry now adequately capitalized and willing to make credit available at very attractive rates 
the initial reaction to the american taxpayer relief act of has been positive for the markets since many of the individual tax policy uncertainties have been settled 
the bush era personal income tax rates have been made permanent for those individuals making under  and capital gains  dividend income  and estate tax rates have been set going forward with unemployment benefits having been extended for another year 
however  many uncertainties remain to be addressed in the areas of corporate tax rates and incentives as well as the required governmental spending reductions that will become necessary to reduce the deficit 
the federal reserve s continued efforts to maintain low interest rates during the months ahead  coupled with relatively high unemployment rates and low capacity utilization rates  should continue to contain the underlying inflationary pressure over the near to intermediate term 
in the long term however  the magnitude of future inflationary pressure will depend on the government s resolve in completing the actions that are necessary to restore a climate of fiscal discipline by reducing the size of the fiscal budget deficit 
through the next few years  economic growth is likely to remain under historically average trends given the expected impact of a combination of government spending reductions and revenue increases needed to reduce the level of our ongoing federal deficit 
this deleveraging would likely moderate the underlying growth potential of the united states as well as many of the other major economies over the next five to seven years 
executive overview compared to income statement the corporation reported net income of million or diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  for the same period in return on average equity roe and return on average assets roa for the twelve months ended december   were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for the same period in the increase in net income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  was largely related to a million increase in non interest income  comprised primarily of increases in wealth management revenue and gains on sale of residential mortgage loans 
also contributing to the net income increase was a million increase in net interest income and a million decrease in provision between the periods 
these improvements were substantially offset by a million increase in non interest expense and a million increase in income tax expense for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the million  or increase in the corporation s tax equivalent net interest income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  was attributed to a million  or  decrease in tax equivalent interest expense offset by a million  or  decrease in tax equivalent interest income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the corporation s tax equivalent net interest margin declined to for the twelve months ended december  from for the same period in for the twelve months ended december   the provision for loan and lease losses of million was a decrease of million from the million for the same period in this decrease was partially the result of a million  or  decline in net loan charge offs for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the decrease in net loan charge offs was concentrated in the commercial mortgage  leasing and residential mortgage segments of the portfolio 
non interest income for the twelve months ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period in largely contributing to the increase in non interest income was an million  or  increase in fees for wealth management services  as the additions of pwmg in may and dtc in may had a significant impact on wealth management revenue 
augmenting the wealth management revenue increase was a million  or  increase in the gain on sale of residential mortgage loans for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in during  the corporation experienced a surge in the volume of residential mortgage loan originations  as the low interest rate climate spurred on another refinancing boom 
non interest expense for the twelve months ended december   was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period in contributing to this increase were a million increase in salaries and employee benefits and a million increase in due diligence and merger related expenses 
during  the corporation completed two transactions which not only accounted for the due diligence and merger related expense increase  but also added overhead costs in the form of salaries and employee benefits as well as occupancy costs related to the new employees and facilities 
balance sheet asset quality remained relatively stable as of december  the allowance for loan and lease losses of million was of portfolio loans and leases  as of december   as compared to million  or of portfolio loans and leases  at december  the increase in the allowance as of december   as compared to december   is reflective of the increase in the balance of loan portfolio between the dates 
total portfolio loans and leases of billion at december  increased million  or  as compared to billion at december  the loan growth was concentrated in the commercial mortgage and commercial and industrial segments of the portfolio and was largely related to the million of loans acquired from fbd 
the corporation s investment portfolio at december  had a fair market value of million  as compared to million at december   as cash inflows from maturities  calls and pay downs as well as deposit inflows were reinvested 
deposits of billion  as of december   increased million from december  the increase was partially the result of the million of deposits acquired from fbd  along with significant organic growth concentrated in the money market segment of the portfolio 
compared to income statement in general  the differences in the results of operations for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  were significantly impacted by the july  merger with fkf and the may  acquisition of pwmg 
the corporation reported net income of million or diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  for the same period in roe and roa for the twelve months ended december   were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for the same period in the increase in net income and  in turn  roe and roa for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily related to a million increase in net interest income  a million increase in non interest income and a million decrease in provision 
these improvements were partially offset by a million increase in non interest expense and a million increase in income tax expense for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the million  or increase in the corporation s tax equivalent net interest income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  was largely attributed to a million  or  increase in tax equivalent interest income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in which was primarily the result of a million increase in average portfolio loans between the periods 
the corporation s tax equivalent net interest margin increased to for the twelve months ended december  from for the same period in for the twelve months ended december   the provision for loan and lease losses of million was a decrease of million  or  from the million for the same period in this decrease resulted from the million  or  decline in net loan charge offs for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the decrease in net loan charge offs was primarily related to the million decrease in net charge offs of commercial and industrial loans between the periods 
increases in non performing loans  primarily related to two residential construction loan relationships which became non performing during  required additional provision  partially offsetting the charge off declines 
non interest income for the twelve months ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period in largely contributing to the increase in non interest income for the twelve months ended december  was a million  or  increase in fees for wealth management services 
this increase was primarily attributable to the may  acquisition of pwmg  which initially added billion to the corporation s assets under management  administration  supervision and brokerage 
partially offsetting the increase in wealth management revenues was a million decrease in the gain on sale of residential mortgage loans for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in during  the corporation experienced a decline in the volume of residential mortgage loan originations  as the refinancing boom of dropped off and did not continue into in addition  the corporation elected to retain a larger portion of the originated residential loans in its portfolio 
non interest expense for the twelve months ended december   was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period in contributing to this increase were a million increase in salaries and benefits expenses  a million increase in occupancy related expenses  a thousand increase in impairment of mortgage servicing rights  a million increase in other operating expenses and a million increase in intangible asset amortization 
these increases were substantially offset by a million decrease in due diligence and merger related expenses between the periods 
components of net income net income is comprised of five major elements net interest income  or the difference between the interest income earned on loans  leases and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds  provision for loan and lease losses  or the amount added to the allowance to provide for estimated inherent losses on portfolio loans and leases  non interest income which is made up primarily of wealth management revenue  gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans  gains and losses from the sale of available for sale investment securities and other fees from loan and deposit services  non interest expense  which consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  intangible asset amortization  professional fees and other operating expenses  and income taxes  which include state and federal jurisdictions

the significant growth in average interest bearing assets included a million increase in average loans  much of which was the result of loan originations  as opposed to the acquisition of loans from fbd  which occurred midway through the fourth quarter of in addition  the strategic decision to prepay the corporation s million of subordinated debt during the third and fourth quarters of contributed to the reduction in tax equivalent rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
tax equivalent net interest income and margin compared to the tax equivalent net interest margin increased basis points to for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  for the same period in tax equivalent net interest income for the twelve months ended december   of million  was million  or  higher than the tax equivalent net interest income of million for the same period in this increase was primarily the result of the million increase in average interest earning assets for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase in average interest earning assets was not only related to the assets acquired in the july  merger with fkf  which were present for all of  as opposed to only six months during  it was also the result of the organic loan growth of million which occurred during the twelve months ended december  partially offsetting the increase in interest earning assets was the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in this increase was largely related to the deposits and other borrowings assumed in the fkf merger 
during the twelve months ended december   the balance of interest bearing liabilities declined million  as fhlb advances and other borrowings decreased by million and the corporation elected to prepay its million of junior subordinated debentures  which had been acquired in the merger with fkf 
the tax equivalent average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities for the twelve months ended december  was  a decrease of basis points from for the same period in largely contributing to this decrease was the basis point decline in tax equivalent rates paid on interest bearing deposits  as lower rate money market deposits and non interest bearing deposits replaced the scheduled run off of higher rate time and wholesale deposits 
tax equivalent net interest margin quarterly comparison the tax equivalent net interest margin and related components for the past five quarters are shown in the table below quarter year earning asset yield interest bearing liability cost net interest spread effect of non interest bearing sources tax equivalent net interest margin th rd nd st th interest rate sensitivity the corporation actively manages its interest rate sensitivity position 
the objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements and to achieve sustainable growth in net interest income 
the corporation s asset liability committee alco  using policies and procedures approved by the corporation s board of directors  is responsible for the management of the corporation s interest rate sensitivity position 
the corporation manages interest rate sensitivity by changing the mix  pricing and re pricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities  through the management of its investment portfolio  its offerings of loan and selected deposit terms and through wholesale funding 
wholesale funding consists of multiple sources including borrowings from the fhlb  the federal reserve bank of philadelphia s discount window  certificates of deposit from institutional brokers  certificate of deposit account registry service cdars  insured network deposit ind program  institutional deposit corporation idc and pennsylvania local government investment trust plgit 
the corporation uses several tools to manage its interest rate risk including interest rate sensitivity analysis  or gap analysis  market value of portfolio equity analysis  interest rate simulations under various rate scenarios and tax equivalent net interest margin reports 
the results of these reports are compared to limits established by the corporation s alco policies and appropriate adjustments are made if the results are outside the established limits 
the following table demonstrates the annualized result of an interest rate simulation and the estimated effect that a parallel interest rate shift  or shock  in the yield curve and subjective adjustments in deposit pricing  might have on the corporation s projected net interest income over the next months 
this simulation assumes that there is no growth in interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities over the next twelve months 
the changes to net interest income shown below are in compliance with the corporation s policy guidelines 
summary of interest rate simulation december  dollars in thousands estimated change in net interest income over next months change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points basis points the interest rate simulation above demonstrates that the corporation s balance sheet as of december  is asset sensitive  indicating that an increase in interest rates will have a positive impact on net interest income over the next months while a decrease in interest rates will negatively impact net interest income 
in the above simulation  net interest income will increase if rates increase  or basis points 
because the corporation s internal prime loan rate is set  as of december   at  or basis points above the wall street journal prime rate of  a basis point increase in interest rates would have a less significant effect than it would had the corporation not set this prime rate limit 
the basis point decrease scenario shows a million  or  decrease in net interest income over the next twelve months as many of the corporation s liabilities bear rates of interest below and therefore would not be able to sustain the entire decrease 
the four scenarios are directionally consistent with the december  simulation  but reflect a higher interest income increase and percentage change in net interest income due to the current rate environment 
the interest rate simulation is an estimate based on assumptions  which are based on past behavior of customers  along with expectations of future behavior relative to interest rate changes 
in today s uncertain economic environment and the current extended period of very low interest rates  the reliability of the corporation s interest rate simulation model is more uncertain than in other periods 
actual customer behavior may be significantly different than expected behavior  which could cause an unexpected outcome and may result in lower net interest income 
gap report the interest sensitivity  or gap report  identifies interest rate risk by showing repricing gaps in the corporation s balance sheet 
all assets and liabilities are reflected based on behavioral sensitivity  which is usually the earliest of either repricing  maturity  contractual amortization  prepayments or likely call dates 
non maturity deposits  such as now  savings and money market accounts are spread over various time periods based on the expected sensitivity of these rates considering liquidity and the investment preferences of the corporation 
non rate sensitive assets and liabilities are spread over time periods to reflect the corporation s view of the maturity of these funds 
non maturity deposits demand deposits in particular  are recognized by the bank s regulatory agencies to have different sensitivities to interest rate environments 
consequently  it is an accepted practice to spread non maturity deposits over defined time periods in order to capture that sensitivity 
commercial demand deposits are often in the form of compensating balances  and fluctuate inversely to the level of interest rates  the maturity of these deposits is reported as having a shorter life than typical retail demand deposits 
additionally  the bank s regulatory agencies have suggested distribution limits for non maturity deposits 
however  the corporation has taken a more conservative approach than these limits would suggest by forecasting these deposit types with a shorter maturity 
the following table presents the corporation s gap analysis as of december  dollars in millions to days to days years over years non rate sensitive total assets interest bearing deposits with banks investment securities loans and leases allowance cash and due from banks other assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity demand  non interest bearing savings  now and market rate time deposits wholesale non maturity deposits wholesale time deposits short term borrowings fhlb advances and other borrowings other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities cumulative difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities cumulative earning assets as a of cumulative interest bearing liabilities investment securities include available for sale and trading 
loans include portfolio loans and leases and loans held for sale 
the table above indicates that the corporation is asset sensitive and should experience an increase in net interest income in the near term  if interest rates rise 
accordingly  if rates decline  net interest income should decline 
actual results may differ from expected results for many reasons including market reactions  competitor responses  customer behavior and or regulatory actions 
fair value adjustments impacting the statement of income the following table details the actual effect for the twelve month periods ended december   and  and the projected effect  for each of the five years ending december   and thereafter  of the accretable and amortizable fair value adjustments attributable to the fkf merger and the fbd transaction  on net interest income  net non interest income and pretax income 
the projected accretion and amortization is subject to change in future periods related to  among other things  changes in the corporation s estimates of loan cash flows  deposit maturities  loan prepayments  and prepayments of fhlb advances

certain loans were acquired which exhibited deteriorated credit quality since origination and for which the corporation does not expect to collect all contractual payments 
accounting for these purchased credit impaired loans is done in accordance with asc  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the loans were recorded at fair value  reflecting the present value of the amounts expected to be collected 
income recognition on these loans is based on a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected 
acquired loans deemed impaired and considered collateral dependent  with the timing of the sale of loan collateral indeterminate  remain on non accrual status and have no accretable yield 
management evaluates purchased credit impaired loans individually for further impairment 
the balance of the corporation s loan and lease portfolio is evaluated on either an individual basis or on a collective basis for impairment 
refer to notes f and h in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more information regarding the corporation s impaired loans and leases 
general discussion of the allowance for loan and lease losses the balance of the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based on the corporation s review and evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio in relation to past loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions  and other pertinent factors  including the corporation s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
increases to the allowance are implemented through a corresponding provision expense in the corporation s statement of income 
loans and leases deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance 
while the corporation considers the allowance to be adequate  based on information currently available  future additions to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions or the corporation s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses and the corporation s intent with regard to the disposition of loans 
in addition  the pennsylvania department of banking and the federal reserve bank of philadelphia  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance 
the corporation s allowance is the combination of four components that are calculated based on various independent methodologies 
all components of the allowance are based on management s estimates 
these estimates are summarized earlier in this document under the heading critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates 
the four components of the allowance are as follows specific loan evaluation component includes the specific evaluation of larger classified loans historical charge off component applies a rolling  twelve quarter  historical charge off rate to pools of non classified loans additional qualitative factors component the loan and lease portfolios are broken down into multiple homogenous sub classifications  upon which multiple factors such as delinquency trends  economic conditions  loan terms  credit grade  state of origination  industry  regulatory environment and other relevant information are evaluated  resulting in an allowance amount for each of the sub classifications 
the sum of these amounts comprises the additional qualitative factors component 
unallocated component this amount represents a reserve against all loans for factors not included in the components mentioned above 
as part of the process of allocating the allowance to the different segments of the loan and lease portfolio  management considers certain credit quality indicators 
for the commercial mortgage  construction and commercial and industrial loan segments  periodic reviews of the individual loans are performed by both in house employees as well as an external loan review service 
the results of these reviews are reflected in the risk grade assigned to each loan 
these internally assigned grades are as follows pass loans considered satisfactory with no indications of deterioration 
special mention loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention 
if left uncorrected  these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date 
substandard loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard loans have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
loan balances classified as doubtful have been reduced by partial charge offs and are carried at their net realizable values 
consumer credit exposure  which includes residential mortgages  home equity lines and loans  leases and consumer loans  are assigned a credit risk profile based on payment activity that is  their delinquency status 
refer to note f in the notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding credit quality indicators associated with the bank s loan and lease portfolio 
portfolio segmentation the corporation s loan and lease portfolio is divided into specific segments of loans and leases having similar characteristics 
these segments are as follows commercial mortgage home equity lines and loans residential mortgage construction commercial and industrial consumer leases refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and page of this md a under the heading portfolio loans and leases for details of the corporation s loan and lease portfolio  broken down by portfolio segment 
impairment measurement in accordance with guidance provided by asc  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the corporation employs one of three methods to determine and measure impairment the present value of future cash flow method  the fair value of collateral method  the observable market price of a loan method 
the majority of loans and leases are evaluated for impairment on a collective basis 
however  loans and leases for which there is an indication that all contractual payments may not be collectible are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis 
loans that are evaluated on an individual basis include non performing loans  troubled debt restructurings and purchased credit impaired loans 
nonaccrual loans in general  loans and leases that are delinquent on contractually due principal or interest payments for more than days are placed on nonaccrual status and any unpaid interest is reversed as a charge to interest income 
when the loan resumes payment  all payments principal and interest are applied to reduce principal 
after a period of six months of satisfactory performance  the loan may be placed back on accrual status 
any interest payments received during the nonaccrual period that had been applied to reduce principal are reversed and recorded as a deferred fee which accretes to interest income over the remaining term of the loan or lease 
in certain cases  the corporation may have information about a particular loan or lease that may indicate a future disruption or curtailment of contractual payments 
in these cases  the corporation will preemptively place the loan or lease on nonaccrual status 
troubled debt restructurings tdrs the corporation follows guidance provided by asc  troubled debt restructurings by creditors 
a restructuring of a debt constitutes a tdr if the creditor  for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider in the normal course of business 
a concession may include an extension of repayment terms which would not normally be granted  a reduction of interest rate or the forgiveness of principal and or accrued interest 
if the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty and the creditor has granted a concession  the corporation will make the necessary disclosures related to the tdr 
in certain cases  a modification may be made in an effort to retain a customer who is not experiencing financial difficulty 
this type of modification is not considered to be a tdr 
once a loan or lease has been modified and is considered a tdr  it is reported as an impaired loan or lease 
if the loan or lease deemed a tdr has performed for at least six months at the level prescribed by the modification  it is not considered to be non performing  however  it will generally continue to be reported as impaired 
loans and leases that have performed for at least six months are reported as tdrs in compliance with modified terms 
refer to notes g in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the corporation s tdrs 
charge off policy the corporation s charge off policy is that  on a periodic basis  not less often than quarterly  delinquent and non performing loans that exceed the following limits are considered for charge off open ended consumer loans exceeding days past due 
closed ended consumer loans exceeding days past due 
all commercial business purpose loans exceeding days past due 
all leases exceeding days past due 
any other loan or lease  for which the corporation has reason to believe collectibility is unlikely  and for which sufficient collateral does not exist  is also charged off 
refer to notes f in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the corporation s charge offs and factors which influenced management s judgment with respect thereto 
asset quality and analysis of credit risk as of december   total non performing loans and leases of million representing of portfolio loans and leases  as compared to  or million  as of december  the thousand increase in non performing loans and leases is comprised of a million increase in nonperforming commercial and industrial loans and a thousand increase in nonperforming residential mortgages 
these increases were substantially offset by reductions of thousand and thousand in nonperforming commercial mortgages and construction loans  respectively  between the dates 
the provision for the twelve month periods ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively

liquidity the corporation has significant sources and availability of liquidity at december  as discussed in this section 
the liquidity position is managed on a daily basis as part of the daily settlement function and on a monthly basis as part of the asset liability management process 
the corporation s primary liquidity is maintained by managing its deposits along with the utilization of purchased federal funds  borrowings from the fhlb and utilization of other wholesale funding sources 
secondary sources of liquidity include the sale of investment securities and certain loans in the secondary market

the corporation s policy is to keep the investment portfolio at a minimum of of total assets

in november  the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic approved section of the dodd frank act providing temporary unlimited coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts 
the term of this unlimited coverage ended on december  off balance sheet risk the corporation becomes party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and create off balance sheet risk 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to a customer for a third party 
such standby letters of credit are issued to support private borrowing arrangements 
the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is similar to that involved in granting loan facilities to customers 
the following chart presents the off balance sheet commitments of the corporation as of december   listed by dates of funding or payment dollars in millions total within year years years after years unfunded loan commitments standby letters of credit total estimated fair values of the corporation s off balance sheet instruments are based on fees and rates currently charged to enter into similar loan agreements  taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties credit standing 
collateral requirements for off balance sheet items are generally based upon the same standards and policies as booked loans 
since fees and rates charged for off balance sheet items are at market levels when set  there is no material difference between the stated amount and the estimated fair value of off balance sheet instruments 
contractual cash obligations of the corporation as of december  dollars in millions total within year years years after years deposits without a stated maturity wholesale and retail certificates of deposit short term borrowings fhlb advances and other borrowings operating leases purchase obligations non discretionary pension contributions total other information regulatory matters and pending legislation on june   the federal reserve approved proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to the corporation and the bank 
the fdic and the occ subsequently approved these proposed rules on june  the proposed rules implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the dodd frank act 
basel iii refers to two consultative documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision in december  the rules text released in december  and loss absorbency rules issued in january  which include significant changes to bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements 
the comment period for the proposed rules has ended and a final ruling is pending 
the proposed rules include new risk based capital and leverage ratios  which would be phased in from to  and would refine the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios 
the proposed new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the corporation and the bank under the proposals would be i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of for all institutions 
the proposed rules would also establish a capital conservation buffer of above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements  which must consist entirely of common equity tier capital and would result in the following minimum ratios i a common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of  and iii a total capital ratio of 
the new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in january at of risk weighted assets and would increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in january an institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends  engaging in share repurchases  and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount 
these limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions 
basel iii provided discretion for regulators to impose an additional buffer  the countercyclical buffer  of up to of common equity tier capital to take into account the macro financial environment and periods of excessive credit growth 
however  the proposed rules permit the countercyclical buffer to be applied only to advanced approach banks ie  banks with billion or more in total assets or billion or more in total foreign exposures  which currently excludes the corporation and the bank 
the proposed rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with basel iii regarding the various components of tier capital  including common equity  unrealized gains and losses  as well as certain instruments that will no longer qualify as tier capital  some of which would be phased out over time 
the federal bank regulatory agencies also proposed revisions to the prompt corrective action framework  which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions  including the bank  if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness 
these revisions would take effect january  under the prompt corrective action requirements  which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer  insured depository institutions would be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as well capitalized i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of increased from 
the proposed rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk weighted assets  which we would be required to utilize beginning january  the standardized approach proposed rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights  and also addresses i proposed alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with section a of the dodd frank act  ii revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation  iii rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans  iv revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo style transactions  and v disclosure requirements for top tier banking organizations with billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the advance approach rules that apply to banks with greater than billion in consolidated assets 
the dodd frank act expanded the base for fdic insurance assessments  requiring that assessments be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
on february   the fdic approved a final rule to implement the foregoing provision of the dodd frank act and to make other changes to the deposit insurance assessment system applicable to insured depository institutions with over billion in assets 
among other things  the final rule eliminated risk categories and the use of long term debt issuer ratings in calculating risk based assessments  and instead implemented a scorecard method  combining camels ratings and certain forward looking financial measures to assess the risk an institution poses to the deposit insurance fund 
the final rule also revised the assessment rate schedule for large institutions and highly complex institutions to provide assessments ranging from to basis points 
except as specifically provided  the final rule took effect for the quarter beginning april  effects of inflation inflation has some impact on the corporation s operating costs 
unlike many industrial companies  however  substantially all of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the corporation s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of goods and services 
effect of government monetary policies the earnings of the corporation are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies 
an important function of the federal reserve board is to regulate the money supply and interest rates 
among the instruments used to implement those objectives are open market operations in united states government securities and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments  and deposits  and their use may also affect rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 
the corporation is a member of the federal reserve system and  therefore  the policies and regulations of the federal reserve board have a significant effect on its deposits  loans and investment growth  as well as the rate of interest earned and paid  and are expected to affect the corporation s operations in the future 
the effect of such policies and regulations upon the future business and earnings of the corporation cannot be predicted
