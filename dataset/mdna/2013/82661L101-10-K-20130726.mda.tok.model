table of contents overview the company operates in one business segment as an independent provider of ems  which includes printed circuit board assemblies and completely assembled box build electronic products 
in connection with the production of assembled products  the company also provides services to its customers  including automatic and manual assembly and testing of products  material sourcing and procurement  manufacturing and test engineering support  design services  warehousing and distribution services  and assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies 
the company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the united states  mexico  china  vietnam and taiwan 
on may   sigmatron acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of spitfire 
spitfire was a privately held illinois corporation with captive manufacturing sites in chihuahua  mexico and suburban ho chi minh city  vietnam 
both manufacturing sites were among the assets acquired by the company 
spitfire was an original equipment manufacturer of electronic controls  with a focus on the major appliance white goods industry 
although north america is currently its primary market  spitfire has applications that can be used worldwide 
the company provided manufacturing solutions for spitfire since  and was a strategic partner to spitfire as it developed its oem electronic controls business 
the company s spitfire division provides cost effective designs as control solutions for its customers  primarily in high volume applications of domestic cooking ranges  dishwashers  refrigerators  and portable appliances 
it is a member of the association of home appliance manufacturers aham  as well as other industry related trade associations and is iso certified 
the acquisition has enabled the company to offer design services for the first time in specific markets 
the company relies on numerous third party suppliers for components used in the company s production process 
certain of these components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  a customer s specifications may require the company to obtain components from a single source or a small number of suppliers 
the loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
further  the company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers 
the company does not enter into long term purchase agreements with major or single source suppliers 
the company believes that short term purchase orders with its suppliers provides flexibility  given that the company s orders are based on the changing needs of its customers 
sales can be a misleading indicator of the company s financial performance 
sales levels can vary considerably among customers and products depending on the type of services consignment versus turnkey rendered by the company and the demand by customers 
consignment orders require the company to perform manufacturing services on components and other materials supplied by a customer  and the company charges only for its labor  overhead and manufacturing costs  plus a profit 
in the case of turnkey orders  the company provides  in addition to manufacturing services  the components and other materials used in assembly 
turnkey contracts  in general  have a higher dollar volume of sales for each given assembly  owing to inclusion of the cost of components and other materials in net sales and cost of goods sold 
variations in the number of turnkey orders compared to consignment orders can lead to significant fluctuations in the company s revenue and gross margin levels 
consignment orders accounted for less than of the company s revenues for the year ended april  in an effort to facilitate growth of our china operation  the company established a new chinese entity in october that allows the company to provide services competitively to the domestic market in china 
nonetheless  in fiscal year and  the company continued to see a trend of chinese costs increasing  thereby making mexico a more competitive manufacturing location to service north america 
indications suggest that this trend will continue 
we feel the company s international footprint provides our customers with flexibility within the company to manufacture in china  mexico or vietnam 
we believe this strategy has continued to serve the company well during these difficult economic times as its customers continuously evaluate their supply chain strategies 

table of contents in the past  the timing of production and delivery of orders  primarily at the direction of its customers  has caused the company to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in its revenues and earnings 
the company continued to experience pricing pressures from both its customer and suppliers 
the company expects continuing pressure on margins until the economy achieves a sustained recovery 
the company is hopeful to see that start the second half of calendar until that time  the company will continue to carefully manage its cost structure 
the company continues to add new customers and new programs with existing customers 
some are not launching or transitioning as quickly as initially forecasted by the company s customers  but the company believes they will eventually add to its revenue base 
we continue to work on integrating spitfire into sigmatron  which the company believes is proceeding on plan and has started to add to our menu of services that we can offer customers 
due to the acquisition of spitfire  effective june   the company discontinued selling to spitfire and instead began selling directly to spitfires customers 
on may   the company entered into a real estate lease agreement to relocate its tijuana  mexico operation to a new facility within tijuana  mexico 
the relocation was completed in july as of april   the company has incurred approximately  in relocation expenses as a result of the move as of april  all incentives realized under the lease will be recognized over the term of the lease  which is five years 
critical accounting policies management estimates and uncertainties the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include depreciation and amortization periods  the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for inventory and valuation of long lived assets 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of the company s electronic manufacturing services business are recognized when the finished good product is shipped to the customer 
in general  and except for consignment inventory  it is the company s policy to recognize revenue and related costs when the finished goods have been shipped from its facilities  which is also the same point that title passes under the terms of the purchase order 
finished goods inventory for certain customers is shipped from the company to an independent warehouse for storage or shipped directly to the customer and stored in a segregated part of the customer s own facility 
upon the customer s request for finished goods inventory  the inventory is shipped to the customer if the inventory was stored off site  or transferred from the segregated part of the customer s facility for consumption or use by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue upon such shipment or transfer 
the company does not earn a fee for such arrangements 
the company from time to time may ship finished goods from its facilities  which is also the same point that title passes under the terms of the purchase order  and invoice the customer at the end of the calendar month 
this is done only in special circumstances to accommodate a specific customer 
further  from time to time customers request the company hold finished goods after they have been invoiced to consolidate finished goods for shipping purposes 
the company generally provides a day warranty for workmanship only and does not have any installation  acceptance or sales incentives although the company has negotiated longer warranty terms in certain instances 
the company assembles and tests assemblies based on customers specifications 
historically  the amount of returns for workmanship issues has been de minimis under the company s standard or extended warranties 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
in the event of an inventory write down  the company records expense to state the inventory at lower of cost or market 
the company establishes inventory reserves for valuation  shrinkage  and excess and obsolete inventory 
the company records provisions for inventory shrinkage based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect the company s inventories and cost of products sold 
the company records provisions for excess and obsolete inventories for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
actual product demand or market conditions could be different than that projected by management 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the company to assess goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment 
the company is permitted the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its corresponding carrying value 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  the company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its corresponding carrying value then the company is not required to take further action 
however  if the company concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test  including computing the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  a second step of the test is required to determine if recorded goodwill is impaired 
the company also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for goodwill in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
the company will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of february  and determined no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets for impairment 
property  machinery and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment 
if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment  the company s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long lived assets are largely independent of other groups of its assets and liabilities 
this analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology  the continued success of product lines  and future volume  revenue and expense growth rates 
the company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment  and review business plans for possible impairment 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset group 
when impairment is indicated  the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value 
income tax the company s income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
the company is subject to income taxes in both the us and several foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates by management are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense assessment 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and tax credit carryforwards 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  the company begins with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies  and incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment and estimates by management about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  the company considers three years of cumulative operating income and or loss 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 

table of contents a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may only be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
the company adjusts its tax liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
new accounting standards there are no recent accounting standards that had  or are expected to have  a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements
