you should specifically consider the various risk factors identified in this filing that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
executive overview what were our key financial results our net sales in increased to million compared to million in  including a increase in net sales of converted product and a decrease in parent roll sales 
this marks the first time the company has achieved more than million in net sales 
net sales of converted product were million during  a new twelve month record 
converted product net sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in our earnings per diluted common share in increased to per diluted common share compared with per diluted common share in our ebitda in increased to million compared to million in we continued our trend of positive operating cash flow in of million 
we have generated positive operating cash flow each of the last ten years 
what did we focus on in in  we focused on increasing sales of converted product to fill out our converting capacity 
our efforts centered on new product development in both paper making and converting and combining those efforts with an effective sales and marketing plan 
as a result of these efforts  we continued to expand our product offerings into the mid and premium tier markets  creating new sales opportunities which resulted in shipments of million in  a increase over cases shipped in these efforts were instrumental in allowing us to secure new understandings for with several retailers for approximately million cases of new business 
approximately million cases of these new understandings were scheduled to begin shipment early in the first quarter of  while the remainder were expected to begin shipment by the beginning of the third quarter of we achieved a new record for annual converted product net sales at million and surpassed million in total net sales for the first time in the company history 
we also focused considerable efforts on controlling production costs while improving quality attributes  such as bathroom tissue softness  to supplement the higher product quality production capabilities of the new converting line 
these efforts will continue in as we continue our expansion into the mid tier and premium tier markets 

table of contents the following graph shows shipments of our mid tier and premium tier products as a percentage of total cases shipped graphic over the past year  we explored various strategic alternatives that may be available to the company 
the review of strategic alternatives was conducted under the supervision of our board of directors with the assistance of a financial advisor retained by the company 
the review process involved an analysis of both strategic and financial alternatives that are available to the company to potentially enhance stockholder value 
the strategic alternatives considered the acquisition of a complimentary business or the possible sale or merger of the company 
at this time  we have not been successful in finding an acceptable acquisition  sale  or merger opportunity that would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
accordingly  the board of directors determined that we should conclude our formal review of strategic alternatives in conjunction with the company financial advisor 
we will continue to implement our stand alone strategy  particularly our efforts to increase capacity and efficiency  in order to maximize the company competitive position 
the company excess cash flow will continue to be used to return cash to its stockholders in the form of quarterly dividends 
although we have concluded our present formal review  the board of directors will continue to opportunistically seek strategic alternatives  with a view towards further increasing stockholder value 
what challenges and opportunities did our business face in the price of recycled fiber  our primary cost component in the production of parent rolls  decreased in compared to additionally  increased production in our converted product operations allowed for improved absorption of fixed costs 
however  due to a very competitive environment  selling prices of converted products remained flat 
we also incurred higher than normal repairs and maintenance expense in our paper mill due to equipment repairs 
we improved the efficiency of our equipment in our converting plant during this helped reduce our converting production costs per case by compared to those experienced in 
table of contents what will we focus on in in  we will continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts on obtaining new business to fill out our expected converting capacity of approximately million cases 
as discussed above  we have secured understandings for million cases of new business that we expect will increase our annual run rate to approximately million cases by the third quarter of we intend to focus our sales efforts on the mid tier and premium tier product categories and to broaden our customer base  as well as take advantage of strategic opportunities with existing customers 
through our new product development efforts  we have positioned ourselves to produce higher quality tissue products with attractive cost characteristics that provide good price points for retailers and good value for consumers 
in  we intend to build upon the mid tier sales achieved during to further increase our converted product sales 
our paper making operation will continue to work on quality improvement to provide enhanced product attributes for our converting operation  which will aid in our sales efforts to penetrate the higher quality mid tier market 
due to the expected increase in our annual converting run rate  we believe the majority of the paper rolls produced in our paper mill will be utilized in our converting operation 
therefore  the number of parent rolls available for us to sell on the open market will decrease 
we will continue to focus on optimizing our existing operating assets in both converting and paper mill operations 
specific emphasis will be placed on maximizing the efficiency of our converting lines 
emphasis will continue to be placed on identifying root causes of issues that impede productivity and to identify ways to improve our overall production costs 
business overview we are an integrated manufacturer of tissue products serving the private label  or at home market 
we produce bulk tissue paper  known as parent rolls  and convert parent rolls into finished products  including paper towels  bathroom tissue and paper napkins 
we sell any remaining parent rolls to other converters 
our core customer base consists of dollar stores and other discount retailers 
by dollar stores  we mean retailers that offer a limited selection across a broad range of products at everyday low prices in a smaller store format 
we have focused on the dollar stores which are also referred to as discount retailers and the broader discount retail market because of their overall market growth  their consistent order patterns and low number of stock keeping units skus 
the at home tissue market consists of several quality levels  including a value tier  mid tier and premium tier 
our historical business strategy has focused on the value tier market  primarily due to the dollar stores concentration of product offerings in that market and  to some extent  limitations of certain manufacturing equipment 
as part of our growth strategy  we began to systematically invest in manufacturing assets to improve quality  expand our product offerings and strengthen our position as a low cost manufacturer 
this process began with the investment in a new paper machine in which provided the opportunity to produce parent rolls for value tier  mid tier and premium tier converted products and improved our cost structure 
further  we undertook an expansion project that included the purchase and installation of a new converting line and the construction of a new converted product warehouse in mid this project had three main objectives increase the capacity of our converting operation  provide the capability to produce higher quality mid tier and premium tier converted products and reduce warehousing costs by centralizing all warehousing and shipping 
our products are sold primarily under our customers private labels and  to a lesser extent  under our brand names such as colortex  my size  velvet  big mopper  linen soft  soft fluffy  tackle and noble 
all of our converted product revenue is derived pursuant to truck load purchase orders from our customers 
parent roll revenue is derived from purchase orders that generally cover a one month time period 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our customers  which is normal practice within our industry 
because our product is a daily consumable item  the order stream from our customer base is fairly 
table of contents consistent with no significant seasonal fluctuations 
however  we do typically experience some mild seasonal softness in the first and fourth quarters of each year  primarily due to the effects of winter weather on consumers buying habits and occasional effects of holidays on shipping schedules 
changes in the national economy  in general  do not materially affect the market for our converted products 
our profitability depends on several key factors  including the market price of our product  the cost of fiber used in producing paper  the efficiency of operations in both our paper mill and converting facility  and the cost of energy 
the private label market of the tissue industry is highly competitive  and discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  it is difficult to effect price increases 
we expect these competitive conditions to continue 
at present  our parent roll production capacity exceeds the requirements of our converting operation 
as result  we have excess parent rolls that we sell into the open market 
our strategy is to sell all of the parent rolls we manufacture as converted products which generally carry higher margins than parent rolls 
we estimate that at million cases of annual converted product production  we will consume all of our parent roll production in our converting operation and therefore any production beyond that estimate will result in the need to purchase parent rolls on the open market  which we expect would have an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin

liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash and short term investments 
our cash requirements have historically been satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt financings

net proceeds from the offering were million 
following the offering   shares of common stock  par value 
per share  were outstanding 
in july  we effected a for stock split increasing the shares of common stock outstanding to  shares outstanding 
we completed the public offering primarily to help implement our strategy to eliminate our need at that time to purchase paper from third party suppliers through the purchase and installation of a new paper machine 
the funding from the public offering  additional bank financing and cash flow from operations funded the million project 
in  we completed a follow on stock offering that provided million in net proceeds

inventory at december  increased million as compared to for the following reasons we increased finished goods inventories in anticipation of increased converted product business in  we increased inventories of bulk paper rolls to ensure we could meet these increased converted product requirements and to cover e a planned six day outage of our newer paper machine in early january  and we began to carry virgin kraft fiber inventories to meet production requirements related to mid tier and premium tier converted products 
cash flows provided by used in investing activities decreased million in to million cash outflow compared to million cash inflow in  primarily due to million of capital expenditures and million of cash moved into a short term investment account during  compared to million in proceeds received from the sale of investment securities in  which was partially offset by million of capital expenditures

table of contents million for the new converting line  million for the finished goods warehouse and million for the expansion of the waste water treatment plant 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in  primarily attributable to the company debt refinancing  in which we repaid million of long term debt and million on our revolving credit line  assisted by borrowing million at lower interest rates and more flexible terms 
additionally  we paid million of dividends to stockholders in cash flows provided by financing activities in was million  primarily due to million of additional borrowings  offset by million of debt repayments 
on april   the company paid off the remaining unmatured loans under our existing credit facility which totaled million and entered into a new million credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase consisting of the following an million revolving credit line due april  a million real estate term loan with a year term due april and amortized as if it had a year life  and a million machinery and equipment term loan with a year term due july and amortized as if it had a year life 
the credit agreement had the effect of i extending and increasing the company revolving line of credit from million to million  ii refinancing and extending the company current million term loan to a million term loan and iii refinancing and extending the company two construction loans of million into a single million term loan 
under the terms of the credit agreement  amounts outstanding will bear interest  at the company election  at the prime rate with a floor of the adjusted one month libor rate  as defined in the credit facility agreement or libor  plus a margin 
the margin for the revolver and term loan is based on the company funded debt to ebitda ratio  and is adjusted quarterly 
the margin ranges from negative basis points to basis points for prime rate loans and from basis points to basis points for libor rate loans 
the margin for term loan is fixed at basis points over libor 
obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company assets 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type  including  but not limited to  limitations on additional borrowings  additional investments and asset sales  and maximum annual capital expenditures of million 
we believe the most significant covenants under our credit facility are the funded debt to ebitda ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum tangible net worth 
the table below compares the actual ratios with the limits specified in the credit agreement 
actual as of required in credit agreement excess funded debt to ebitda ratio fixed charge coverage ratio tangible net worth under the terms of the credit agreement  base tangible net worth is million as of april   and increases each fiscal year by of positive net income for the fiscal year

as of december   our 
table of contents qualified receivables were million and our qualified inventory was million  which  when added to the million of equipment availability yielded a total borrowing base of million and consequently the full million revolving credit facility was not available to us 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit line at december  contractual obligations as of december   our contractual cash obligations were our long term debt and associated interest  and natural gas contract 
we do not have any material leasing commitments or debt guarantees outstanding as of december  we do not have any defined benefit pension plans or any obligation to fund any postretirement benefit obligations for our work force 
maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period years contractual cash obligations total and and after in thousands long term debt interest payments natural gas contract total under our revolving credit and term loan agreements  the maturity of outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with our loan covenants 
our long term debt carries interest at variable rates 
these amounts have been calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december   which were for term loan and for term loan in october  we entered into a contract to purchase  mmbtu per year of natural gas requirements at per mmbtu plus a per mmbtu management fee for the period from april through march subsequently  the agreement has been extended as follows period mmbtus price per mmbtu management fee per mmbtu april march april march april march april december april september additional  month october march additional  month april december additional  month january march april june july september october december if we are unable to purchase the contracted amounts and the market price at that time is less than the contracted price  we would be obligated under the terms of our agreement to reimburse an amount

off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in significant off balance sheet liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
our management must make estimates of accounts receivable that will not be collected 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer creditworthiness as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
trade receivables are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted  including  but not limited to  external third party collection efforts and litigation 
while such credit losses have historically been within management expectations and the provisions established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
no provision for doubtful accounts was recognized during the years ended december   or the provision for doubtful accounts was reduced by   and  during  and  respectively  based on historical experience and an evaluation of the quality of existing accounts receivable 
there were no recoveries or write offs of accounts receivable during the years ended december   and inventory 
our inventory consists of converted finished goods  bulk paper rolls and raw materials and is based on standard cost  specific identification  or fifo first in  first out 
standard costs approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
material  labor and factory overhead necessary to produce the inventories are included in the standard cost 
our management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on the age of the inventory and forecasts of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
our inventory is monitored each quarter and all potential obsolete items due to product appearance change were written off during the current year 
during the year ended december   we increased the inventory valuation reserve by  which was partially offset by  of write offs of obsolete inventory items 
the reserve requirement was higher at year end due to the introduction of new products during  thereby rendering older products obsolete  and obsolescence of certain chemicals used in our paper mill operation 
during the year ended december   we decreased the inventory valuation reserve by  the reserve requirement was lower at year end due to improved execution of new product packaging changes resulting in less unused and obsolete packaging 
during the year ended december   we increased the inventory valuation reserve by  
table of contents property  plant and equipment 
significant capital expenditures are required to establish and maintain a paper mill and converting facility 
our property  plant and equipment consists of land  buildings and improvements  machinery and equipment  vehicles  parts and spares and construction in process  which are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
our management regularly reviews estimated useful lives to determine whether any changes are necessary to reflect the related assets actual productive lives 
the lives of our property  plant and equipment currently range from to years 
as of december   we estimate that a year decrease in useful lives would have increased our depreciation expense by approximately million  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our gross profit and operating income
