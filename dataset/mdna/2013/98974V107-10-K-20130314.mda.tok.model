overview we are the most prominent online  technology enabled real estate brokerage company in the united states 
our company owned and operated real estate brokerage serves metropolitan markets with over  licensed realtors 
we serve an additional markets through our powered by zip  or pbz  business  which provides our technology platform as an enterprise cloud based application 
we operate ziprealty 
com  the most visited brokerage website with approximately million unique monthly visitors 
we also provide consumers with highly rated mobile applications that offer all of the key features of our website and optimize them for all major platforms and devices 
both our owned and operated brokerage and our powered by zip network share the same internal engine the powerful proprietary customer service technology  known as zap  and the online marketing capabilities that form the foundation of our business 
we developed zap over a year period during which our technology team partnered with realtors across the country to collaboratively develop a customer service platform that empowers real estate professionals to deliver superior customer service in a significantly more efficient approach 
we refer to this innovation feedback loop as our innovation factory and believe that our disciplined management of this process directly led to zap s success in our brokerage and powered by zip network and also allows us to keep this application on the cutting edge 
in december  we launched a transformational zap upgrade that made it even easier for realtors to efficiently manage small and large contact pools with follow up plans  that features an enhanced intelligence engine which predicts client behaviors and propensity to transact  and that is completely redesigned with an intuitive stylized web interface 
we consider our innovation factory to be one of our core competencies  helping us maintain our technology leadership in the residential real estate industry 
as the direct result of offering the most accurate  timely and comprehensive housing information  buyers using our services can quickly find relevant home listings that meet their search criteria and are well positioned when they are ready to interact with local realtors affiliated with our owned and operated brokerage or our pbz network 
at the same time  sellers using our system gain assurance that their listings are marketed effectively online to interested home buyers 
our proprietary technology  established reputation as full service online brokerage  and powered by zip network  as well as our prominence both online and in mobile  allow us to serve three main constituencies in the residential real estate industry first and foremost  we serve serious consumers  which we define as those who expect to purchase or sell a home within the next six to eighteen months 
we offer these consumers our technology and services to provide control  choice and seamless  customized service 
through ziprealty 
com and our award winning mobile apps  we provide consumers with the most accurate and relevant data on homes currently for sale wrapped up in a beautiful and easy to use interface and  when they are ready  connect them with knowledgeable local realtors to assist them through every step of their real estate transaction 
second  we serve real estate professionals in our owned and operated brokerage business 
for these professionals  who seek more productive ways to conduct business in the fiercely competitive residential real estate industry  we generate a large base of customer leads which  through an advanced algorithm developed over the course of years  have been systematically matched to yield productive agent client relationships 
these leads are made even more valuable with zap  which is a system that helps incubate customer relationships with the assistance of powerful prospecting tools and real time data on client activity that enables agents to provide excellent anticipatory service 
we also market ziprealty affiliated realtors on ziprealty 
com by showcasing their local know how and real estate activity and by providing them with personalized agent websites 
third  we serve other real estate brokerages and their affiliated agents who seek a competitive edge in this new era in which consumers are increasingly using online services for home buying and selling 
for these brokerages  we not only generate online leads on their behalf  but we also provide them access to zap as an enterprise cloud based application that better enables them to turn these leads into closed transactions 
zap gives these brokerages crystal clear  real time visibility on their transaction pipeline  brokerage operations and financials  while facilitating a paperless office environment 
because zap is a cloud based application  our brokerage partners benefit from our rapid innovation cycle without the burden of expensive it maintenance and software upgrade costs 
geographic reach we conduct our owned and operated brokerage services in markets nationwide  all of which were opened prior to may austin  tx  baltimore  md  boston  ma  chicago  il  dallas  tx  denver  co  houston  tx  las vegas  nv  los angeles  ca  orange county  ca  orlando  fl  phoenix  az  richmond  va  sacramento  ca  san diego  ca  the san francisco bay area  ca  seattle  wa  portland  or  and washington  dc 
our powered by zip network serves leading local brokerages in markets where we do not otherwise conduct business atlanta  ga  jacksonville  fl  nashville  tn  the greater philadelphia area  pa  raleigh durham  nc  salt lake city  ut  tucson  az  westchester bronx  ny  tampa  fl  palm beach  fl  long island  ny  brooklyn  ny  miami  fl  minneapolis  mn  and virginia beach  va 
the markets in our owned and operated brokerage and powered by zip network are served by approximately  local  licensed real estate agents  all of whom are independent contractors 
in  we extended our mls coverage to include several new markets where we do not yet have a physical presence or a pbz partner 
this expanded coverage facilitates expansion of our pbz network 
at december   our total coverage area encompassed of the us population 
all of our revenues derive from our core business of offering the best proprietary technology and online marketing capabilities available in our industry 
we derive the majority of our net revenues from commissions earned in our owned and operated brokerage representing buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we record commission revenues net of any commission discount  transaction fee adjustment or  when applicable  rebate 
net transaction revenues are principally driven by our base of real estate professionals whose productivity leads to the number of transactions closed and the average net revenue per transaction 
average net revenue per transaction is a function of the home sales price and percentage commission received on each transaction and can vary significantly by market 
we also derive revenues from net commission earned by brokerages in our powered by zip network 
brokerages in our powered by zip network typically pay a combination of a monthly subscription and transaction based success fee for our full saas solution 
this solution includes a co branded website  online agent marketing  a steady stream of leads for their metropolitan area  the zap brokerage operating system for managing the business  and the full agent functionality of the zap platform for managing the client interaction  lead incubation and customer service 
additionally  we derive revenues from our website through marketing arrangements with residential mortgage service providers as well as the sale of online display advertising 
finally  we earn lead referral fees 
for  marketing and other revenues  which includes powered by zip revenues  represented approximately of our net revenues 
recent developments restructuring and realignment in early  we began a restructuring to refocus on our core strengths in technology  online marketing and on our most attractive local real estate markets 
to that end  we closed our offices in markets in the first quarter of fresno central valley  ca  charlotte  sc  naples  fl  jacksonville  fl  miami  fl  palm beach  fl  tampa  fl  hartford  ct  minneapolis  mn  virginia beach  va  tucson  az  atlanta  ga 
we continued our restructuring in the fourth quarter of by closing our offices in raleigh durham  nc  and the greater philadelphia area  pa  and in by closing our offices in salt lake city  ut  and in westchester county long island  ny 
in connection with several of our office closings  we transitioned our local operations to eight third party brokerages in our powered by zip network  who now serve tucson  az  atlanta  ga  raleigh durham  nc  the greater philadelphia area  pa  salt lake city  ut  westchester  ny  long island  ny and brooklyn  ny 
in early  we reorganized our corporate structure by realigning our organization to operate more efficiently and to refocus our resources on the highest value priorities 
we combined our product and marketing functions  and we separated our brokerage operations from our technology and marketing functions 
we recruited a real estate veteran  van davis  to be our president of brokerage operations 
mr 
davis conducted a further reorganization of our field sales team  which has empowered our local offices and real estate professionals to make decisions that are better tailored to the dynamics of their particular markets  with the goal of increasing productivity and customer service levels 
in total  we reduced our corporate overhead  which excludes cost of revenues  by approximately when comparing to legal settlement on september   we signed a settlement agreement with the state of california s department of labor standards enforcement  or dlse  for a release of all its claims that we failed to pay our california real estate agents  who were at the time in question classified as employees  minimum wage and overtime mandated by california laws 
pursuant to that settlement  in the fourth quarter of  we paid million to the dsle for attorneys fees and costs and million to a trust for disbursement to our former employees as back wages 
as this trust disburses funds to our former employees  we will be required to pay the employer s share of fica taxes and other employer tax responsibilities on back wages on those disbursements  as well as the administrative costs of the claims administrator for the trust  which totaled million for the fourth quarter of  which totaled million in  and which could total an additional million if all remaining former employee claimants participate 
a liability and corresponding expense for this additional million of employer taxes and administrative fees have not been reflected within the balance sheet because an estimate of the ultimate liability for payment of these payroll taxes cannot be reasonably determined 
given the unique qualitative test that applies under california law in evaluating the outside sales exemption and the deference afforded the dlse in the context of a law enforcement action  we believed that this settlement was a reasonable resolution in this case 
further  by agreeing to settle this issue  which relates to an employee agent model that we discontinued in and early  we were able to avoid potentially millions of dollars in future litigation costs and the diversion of excessive time and attention of our management and employees from key business initiatives 
powered by zip in  we launched the powered by zip program to provide third party real estate brokerages with our robust proprietary end to end technology solution 
since then  we have built a network of independent brokerages that use our technology  which we refer to as our powered by zip network 
over the past year  we have gained significant experience serving our powered by zip customers 
the terms on which we offer our technology vary among these brokerages because we are still developing  testing and building our business model  and because each brokerage is at a different stage of adoption and incorporation of the technology and services into their business 
we currently evaluate each individual brokerage s performance using the same metrics that we do for our owned and operated brokerage  as well as other subjective measures such as the agents experience and level of engagement with our technology 
we are developing new pricing schedules for our current offering  which is currently offered on an exclusive basis in any one metropolitan area 
additionally  our technology and product teams are developing new versions of the offering  including a version designed to serve multiple customers in the same metropolitan area nonexclusively  and a subscription model for real estate professionals 
we are also in the process of developing a formal organizational structure for the powered by zip business and  within the next several quarters  we expect to hire managers and staff in sales  account management  operations and integration  and product development 
customer service platform zap zap is the proprietary technological engine that drives our business 
we continually upgrade zap in response to feedback from consumers  real estate professionals  field leadership  and corporate management and staff 
this year  we embarked upon an aggressive program to develop and deliver the most transformational change to zap in over five years 
to that end  in december  we launched a transformational upgrade that made it even easier for realtors to efficiently manage small and large contact pools with follow up plans  that features a new intelligence engine that predicts client behaviors and their propensity to transact  and that is completely redesigned with an intuitive  stylized web sheen 
we believe that adoption of the upgraded zap in our owned and operated and powered by zip businesses will help improve agent productivity in market conditions and trends in our business we compete in the domestic residential real estate market 
for the past few years  this market has been negatively impacted by the significant correction in the total value of homesale transactions in and the deep economic recession that followed 
the federal reserve responded to these events by implementing an extraordinary accommodation policy designed to improve economic activity 
in  the country experienced an increase in economic activity as measured by gross domestic product gdp 
the us department of commerce  bureau of economic analysis bea recently announced that gdp grew in versus in however  the bea recently reported that real gdp grew at an annual rate of just in the fourth quarter of there are signs that a recovery may be underway  but there are reasons to be cautious 
macroeconomic forces the current federal reserve monetary policy is one of the most significant economic variables affecting the real estate market 
for the past few years  the federal reserve has been pursuing an accommodative monetary policy designed to spur economic growth 
in  perhaps in response to the continued perception that the pace of economic recovery was sluggish  the federal reserve messaged a direct connection between the federal funds rate and macroeconomic factors 
specifically  as detailed in the january  press release  the federal reserve stated its plan to maintain the federal funds rate at to until unemployment drops below  long term inflation defined as that rate projected for the twelve month period between one and two years in the future rises above  and projections of the inflation rate more than two years ahead remain consistent with the federal reserve s inflation rate 
this statement appears to be designed to message that the federal reserve is committed to keeping interest rates low until the domestic economy returns to the healthy economic parameters of unemployment below and inflation at or below 
this accommodative monetary policy continues to depress mortgage rates 
according to freddie mac  in november and december  the national average commitment for a year  conventional  fixed rate mortgage was  the lowest rate on record 
these low rates make housing more affordable for new entrants and existing homeowners who are able to refinance their mortgages and also encourages investors to purchase residential real estate for resale or rental 
in  we believe that the health of the residential housing market will continue to be significantly affected by the availability of credit  inventory and shadow inventory levels  the pace at which banks process their foreclosure pipelines  and interest rates  as well as any significant change in unemployment levels 
we cannot predict any changes in those macroeconomic forces  nor can we predict the combined impact of those changes on the residential real estate market 
federal action the federal government  state governments and related agencies have acted repeatedly to address the decline in the residential real estate market and the availability of home mortgage credit 
currently  under the dodd frank wall street reform act  federal regulators must develop rules to discourage risky home mortgage lending practices by requiring lenders to retain of the risk in the mortgages they originate  other than qualified residential mortgages  also known as qrms  and other than mortgages that are backed by federally insured mortgage programs 
mortgages that do not meet these exemptions could carry higher interest rates or be less available to home buyers  which could dampen the housing market  particularly if the definition of a qrm is drawn narrowly 
it is too soon to tell what the final rules will require 
to the extent that governments and related agencies take actions to address the residential real estate market or the home mortgage market  there can be no assurance that those activities will have a positive  meaningful and lasting impact on either market  or that they will not result in unintended consequences 
current residential real estate market conditions recent indicators of national residential real estate market include the following volume according to the national association of realtors  or nar  total sales in were the highest in five years 
nar s preliminary annual total for existing home transactions in was million  up percent from million in this volume level represented the highest level since s transaction volume of million 
further  the volume increase in was the highest since persistently low mortgage interest rates seem to have played a large role in affecting sales volume  although inventory shortages and tight lending criteria may be limiting buying opportunities 
price nar s preliminary estimate of median existing home price for the full year was  up percent from  in this year over year increase represented the highest annual price gain since  when the median price rose percent 
the price increase may have been due  in part  to a decrease in the percentage of national home sales that represented distressed properties  as well as inventory shortages 
inventory nar reported a december housing inventory level of million homes  which it stated was approximately a month supply at its estimated current sales pace 
once again  this level is the lowest since may of  which is the year many consider to be at or near the peak of the housing boom 
the sharp decrease in housing inventory is a recent phenomenon housing inventory dropped percent over the past twelve months 
tight inventory supplies can distort the market by causing sharp price increases that are typically only sustainable over a short period of time 
distressed properties currently  a significant percentage of our sales transaction volume is composed of distressed properties 
distressed properties are homes that are in foreclosure  are real estate owned  or reo  by the lending bank  government agency or government loan insurer after an unsuccessful sale as a foreclosure auction  or are short sales  meaning a sale where the sale price is less than the loans or debt secured by the home listed for sale 
in the fourth quarter of  the percentage of our sales transactions composed of distressed properties in our owned and operated markets was approximately  which was down from in the fourth quarter of for those same markets 
distressed properties not only tend to sell at reduced prices  but they also tend to put downward pressure on the values of other homes for sale in the same and nearby neighborhoods 
we expect distressed properties to continue to represent a significant portion of the residential real estate market and of our business for the foreseeable future 
shadow inventory shadow inventory refers to distressed and other properties that have not yet been listed for sale  as well as properties that homeowners wish to sell  but will not sell at current market prices 
for october  corelogic  a leading provider of consumer  financial and property information  analytics and services to business and government  estimated shadow inventory at million properties  which consisted of million properties backed by loans classified as seriously delinquent   properties with loans that were in some stage of foreclosure  and  properties that were reo 
the corelogic report estimated that the october shadow inventory number fell by year over year 
shadow inventory is problematic because it represents properties that would negatively impact the housing market if placed on the market for sale 
the timing and volume of such action is driven by a wide range of variables including the financial health of the lender that holds the title  an owner s financial income  federal and state regulations on foreclosure and local government foreclosure moratoriums 
it is impossible to accurately assess the current volume of shadow inventory and its future impact on the residential real estate market  particularly given the uncertainty surrounding the foreclosure processing delays instituted by many major mortgage lenders as they settle their disputes with regulators concerning their lending practices 
fluctuations in quarterly profitability we have experienced fluctuations in profitability from period to period 
our profitability has been impacted by various factors  including ongoing market challenges  government intervention  seasonality  market expansions and closures  and legal settlements such as the september settlement with the california dlse discussed above 
industry seasonality and cyclicality the residential real estate brokerage market is influenced both by seasonal factors and by overall economic cycles 
while individual markets vary  transaction volume nationally tends to increase progressively from january through the summer months  then to slow gradually over the last three to four months of the calendar year 
revenues in each quarter are significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter  given the typical to day time lag between contract execution and closing for traditional home purchases 
for non traditional sales  the time lag from contract execution to closing can be longer 
we have been  and believe we will continue to be  influenced by overall market activity and seasonal forces 
we generally experience the most significant impact in the first and fourth quarters of each year  when our revenues are typically lower relative to the second and third quarters as a result of traditionally slower home sales activity and reduced listings inventory between thanksgiving and presidents day 
the impact of seasonality can be masked by the general health of the residential real estate market at any given point in time  whether affected by macroeconomic events  periodic business cycles or other factors 
generally  when economic conditions are fair or good  the housing market tends to perform well 
if the economy is weak  if interest rates dramatically increase  if mortgage lending standards tighten  or if there are disturbances such as terrorist attacks or threats  the outbreak of war or geopolitical uncertainties  the housing market likely would be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and of those policies  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been delivered and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we derive the majority of our net revenues from commissions earned in our owned and operated residential real estate brokerage  and from commission referrals earned from brokers in our powered by zip network 
we recognize commission based revenues upon closing of a sale and purchase transaction  net of any rebate  commission discount or transaction fee adjustment 
these transactions typically do not have multiple deliverable arrangements 
non commission based revenues are derived primarily from marketing agreements with residential mortgage service providers  the sale of online advertising  lead referral fees and other revenues 
we classify these revenues as marketing and other revenues 
marketing service revenues are recognized over the term of the agreements as the contracted services are delivered 
advertising revenues on contracts are recognized as impressions are delivered or as clicks are provided to advertisers 
advertising and marketing contracts may consist of multiple deliverables which generally include a blend of various impressions or clicks as well as other marketing deliverables 
revenues related to revenue sharing arrangements are recognized based on revenue reports received from our partners  provided that collectability is reasonably assured 
internal use software and website development costs we account for internal use software and website development costs  including the development of our customer service platform which we refer to as zap  in accordance with the guidance set forth in the related accounting standards 
we capitalize internal costs consisting of payroll and direct payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software  as well as any external direct costs 
we amortize these costs over their estimated useful lives  which typically is months 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
the estimated life is based on management s judgment as to the product life cycle 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of capitalized internal use software and website development costs for impairment when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
as of december   we have not recorded any charges for impairment of capitalized internal use software and website development costs to date 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of accounting standards for share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees  consultants and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases  based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the accounting standards  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which incorporates various assumptions including volatility  expected life and interest rates 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected life of options is estimated by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
we estimate expected forfeitures based on various factors including employee class and historical experience 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period adjusted for the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent historical results and our expectations for the future 
historically  we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  the majority of which relate to net operating loss carryforwards and we maintain that a full valuation allowance should be accounted for against our net deferred tax assets at december  restructuring charges in connection with our cost reduction initiatives  we record restructuring charges for employee termination costs  costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased  fixed asset impairments and other exit related costs 
formal plans are developed and approved by management 
restructuring costs related to employee severance and related expenses are recorded when probable and estimable 
fixed assets impaired as a result of restructuring are typically accounted for as assets held for sale or abandoned 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing  and costs associated with the planned restructuring activity  including estimating sublease income and the fair value  less selling costs  of fixed assets being disposed of 
estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or to reduce or reverse the amount of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued liabilities to ensure their adequacy  that no excess accruals are retained and that the utilization of the provisions is for the intended purpose in accordance with the approved restructuring plan 
in the event circumstances change and the provision is no longer required  the provision is reversed 
litigation we are involved in legal proceedings on an ongoing basis 
based upon our evaluation and consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we accrue for losses related to litigation if we determine that a loss is probable and it can be reasonably estimated 
if only a range of estimated losses can be determined  then we record an amount within the range that  in our judgment  reflects the most likely outcome  if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record the low end of the range 
any such accrual is charged to expense in the appropriate period 
we record litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
 disclosure about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu will require the company to disclose information about offsetting related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effects of those arrangements on its financial position 
the new guidance is effective for the company s interim period ending march  the disclosures required are to be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
the company does not expect that this guidance will have an impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure only in nature 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires entities to present information regarding reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements 
the amendment becomes effective for reporting periods beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
the company has adopted this guidance during the year ended december  this guidance did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as it is an enhancement to current required disclosures

same markets operating data excludes markets closed as the result of our and restructuring plans 
these plans included closing our owned and operated brokerage operations in selected underperforming markets and  in certain markets  transitioning operations to a third party brokerage joining our powered by zip network 
we closed our owned and operated brokerage offices in fresno central valley  charlotte  naples  jacksonville  miami  palm beach  tampa  hartford  minneapolis  virginia beach  atlanta  and tucson during the quarter ended march  and we closed philadelphia and raleigh durham during the quarter ended december  operations in atlanta  tucson  raleigh  and philadelphia were transitioned to our powered by zip network of third party brokerages 
our brokerage operations in salt lake city were closed and transitioned to a brokerage in the powered by zip network during the quarter ended march  the westchester bronx portion and the long island portion of our new york brokerage operations were transitioned to third party brokerages in the powered by zip network during the quarter ended june  and september   respectively  and are excluded from the owned and operated data for all periods 
the term transaction refers to each representation of a buyer or seller in a real estate purchase or sale 
average net revenue per transaction equals net transaction revenues divided by number of transactions with respect to each period 
net revenues net transaction revenues consist primarily of commissions earned in our owned and operated residential real estate brokerage

year ended december  increase percent decrease change in thousands net transaction revenues same market    closed market   marketing and other revenues   total net revenues    the decrease in our net transaction revenues of million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was driven primarily by a decrease in the number of transactions closed during the period of  or compared to the last year 
transactions closed during the period on a same market basis were  compared to  last year  a decrease of  or 
we believe the decrease in same market transaction volume was attributable to the disruption to our business model and to our agent population from our restructuring and the conversion of our agents to independent contractors 
the market continues to be impacted by weak economic conditions and reduced availability of mortgage financing  although  as noted above  there are signs that a recovery may be underway 
same market average net revenue per transaction for the period was  compared to  last year  an increase of or 
we discontinued our commission rebate program during late summer resulting in lower cash rebates paid during the year which increased average net revenue per transaction in by approximately compared to the prior year 
the remaining increase in the same market average net revenue per transaction was due to the impact of higher average homesale prices and changes in our average commission rates 
the decrease in marketing and other revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributable to a decrease in lead generation income and advertising revenue of approximately million offset by an increase in transaction referrals  principally from brokers in our powered by zip network  of approximately million 
we expect our net revenues will increase modestly in compared to  driven by an increase in the overall number of transactions closed and an increase in the average net revenue per transaction 
we also expect our marketing and other revenue will increase for primarily attributable to increased transaction commission referrals earned from brokers in our powered by zip network 
cost of revenues during the quarter ended march   we completed the transition of our agent force from an employee model to an independent contractor model 
under the employee model  our cost of revenues consisted principally of commissions  payroll taxes  benefits including health insurance  performance and tenure based award programs and agent expense reimbursements 
under the independent contractor model  our cost of revenues consists principally of commissions and related costs 
agent commissions are generally paid on net transaction revenues plus referral and other revenues generated by our agent 
year ended december  increase percent decrease change in thousands cost of revenues same markets    closed markets   total    the decrease in cost of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily related to the overall decrease in net revenues on which we pay agent commissions 
same market cost of revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  agent commissions decreased by approximately million or 
agent performance and tenure based programs  benefits and expense reimbursements decreased by approximately million or attributable to the transition of our agents to independent contractors who do not qualify for benefits and expense reimbursements and to the elimination of performance and tenure based programs as a component of agent compensation 
same market cost of revenues as a percentage of net transaction revenues was in compared to in we expect our cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars in  compared to  because of an expected increase in net revenues 
our cost of revenues move in relation to the market net revenues on which commissions are based and also increases or decreases as a result of the mix of commission rates paid to our agents 
product development product development expenses include our information technology costs relating to the maintenance of our website  proprietary technology platforms and system infrastructure 
these costs consist primarily of compensation and benefits  software  equipment and infrastructure costs consisting primarily of facilities  communications and other operating expenses 
product development expenses also include amortization of capitalized internal use software and website development costs 
year ended december  increase percent decrease change in thousands product development    the decrease in product development expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to decreases in salaries and benefits of million attributable to reductions in headcount  technology infrastructure costs of million and depreciation of computer hardware and software expense of million 
as a percentage of net revenues  product development expenses decreased by for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we expect to continue enhancing tools and features on our website and technology platform for consumers and brokers in our powered by zip network and expect that our product development expenses will increase in in absolute dollars

year ended december  increase percent decrease change in thousands interest income interest income fluctuates as our cash equivalents and short term investment balances change and applicable interest rates increase or decrease 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was due primarily to lower interest rates earned on lower average balances 
the lower interest rates were primarily attributable to overall decreases in market interest rates combined with maintaining higher money market account balances yielding lower interest rates as we decreased our short term investments positions 
the lower average balances were primarily attributable to cash used in our operating activities as a result of the losses incurred during the year 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity for were our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december  and  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at fair value of million and million  respectively 
we had no bank debt  line of credit or equipment facilities at december  and operating activities our operating activities used cash in the amount of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss of million partially offset by million of depreciation and amortization  million of non cash stock based compensation expense and net changes in working capital

cash used in the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss of million partially offset by million of depreciation and amortization  million of non cash stock based compensation expense and net changes in working capital 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of our net commission income from escrow companies or similar intermediaries in the real estate transaction closing process offset by cash payments for agent commissions and related costs as well as for product development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs including employee compensation  benefits  client acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
due to the structure of our commission arrangements  our accounts receivable are settled in cash on a short term basis and our accounts receivable balances at period end have historically been significantly less than one month s net revenues

cash used for the year ended december  primarily represents the purchase of property and equipment  including amounts expended for internal use software and website development costs offset by the net proceeds from the sale and purchase of short term investments 
currently  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million primarily attributable to amounts capitalized for internal use software and website development costs as well as expenditures for increased server capacity and software 
in the future  our ability to make significant capital investments may depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to obtain adequate financing  if necessary and available 
financing activities our financing activities provided cash of million in the year ended december   primarily from stock option exercises  and provided cash of an insignificant amount in the year ended december  the use of cash of million for the year ended december  primarily represents the repurchase of shares of our common stock in connection with the payment of withholding and payroll taxes due upon vesting of employee restricted stock awards 
future needs we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund cash used in our operations  restructurings and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of investment in technology and online marketing initiatives  our rate of growth in our local markets and in expanding our powered by zip broker referral network and possible litigation settlements and legal fees 
although there are signs that an economic recovery may be underway  if the recent depressed macroeconomic environment and residential real estate market continues without recovering or worsens  we may have a greater need to fund our business by using our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  which could not continue indefinitely without raising additional capital 
we currently have no bank debt or line of credit facilities 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business and results of operations will likely suffer

non gaap measure the table below shows the trend of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands net revenue    adjusted ebitda   adjusted ebitda margin we present adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as a supplemental measure of our performance 
we believe adjusted editda provides useful information regarding the operating results of our core business activity and prospects for the future 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss less interest income plus interest expense  provision for benefit from income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  stock based compensation and further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing core operating performance including litigation settlement charges associated with our former model for our agents  which has since been transitioned from an employee to an independent contractor model 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda to evaluate our financial results and business strategies  develop budgets  manage expenditures and as a factor in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation 
our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash stock based compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges or credits resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective of our core ongoing operations  and other companies  including companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
when evaluating our performance  adjusted ebitda should be considered alongside other financial measures  including net income and our other gaap results 
the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most comparable gaap measure  net loss  for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands reconciliation of non gaap adjusted ebitda to net income loss net loss    add back interest income provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization    stock based compensation expense    restructuring charges  net   litigation settlement charges non core operating  non gaap adjusted ebitda   restructuring charges  net for adjusted ebtida reconciliation purposes excludes  of non cash stock based compensation expense associated with a modification of certain awards previously granted to employees affected by the restructuring which are reflected in the stock based compensation expense line 
litigation settlement charges non core operations represents amounts we consider not reflective of our core ongoing operations and includes settlement and claim expense for litigation associated with our former model for our agents which has since been transitioned from an employee to an independent contractor model 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income consistent with minimizing risk of material loss 
we believe this investment policy is prudent  and helps to reduce  but does not prevent  loss of principal  and results in minimal interest rate exposure on our investments 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and our short term investments consisted primarily of highly liquid interest bearing securities 
the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities and short term investments are carried at fair value 
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument is limited 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are fixed income investments 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   there would be a negligible increase or decline in fair market value of the portfolio 
exchange rate sensitivity we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal  as we do not have any sales or expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
we have not engaged in any hedging or other derivative transactions to date
