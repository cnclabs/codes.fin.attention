item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview for a number of years and through the end of the third quarter of  the company s reporting units were consistent with its operating segments of north america  europe and emerging markets latin america and asia pacific 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reorganized its business segments from geography to end market to reflect its realigned segment reporting structure and management of these global businesses enterprise cabling and security solutions  electrical and electronic wire and cable and oem supply 
all prior period amounts related to the segment change have been retrospectively reclassified throughout these consolidated financial statements to conform to the new presentation 
while was challenging from a macro economic perspective  which is reflected in lower sales in the oem supply segment  the company s continuing implementation of its strategic growth initiatives  combined with strong day to day execution  enabled it to report record sales and improve its competitive position across all segments 
in addition to achieving record annual and fourth quarter sales  other highlights of the year included the mid year acquisition of jorvex  a peruvian wire cable distributor  which has performed well to date and added million of sales for the year  the company s joint venture in saudi arabia which is performing ahead of expectations 
importantly  this project illustrates the company s global capabilities that differentiate it from key competitors and highlights the importance of the company s targeted europe and middle east strategy  continued growth in supply chain solutions with expanded capabilities and penetration  in fiscal  the company generated cash flow from operations of million  which along with the company s strong balance sheet position  allowed it to fund the jorvex acquisition  fund a contribution to the us pension plan that lowers long term pension obligations and costs  and return million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and special dividends 
finally  the company took aggressive and disciplined actions in to restructure its business to align its cost structure with current views of the markets in which the company operates 
with these actions  the company reduced its two largest areas of operating expense  personnel and facility costs  and better positioned it for and beyond 
the company s exposure to customers in a diverse range of industries provided it with some pockets of solid sales particularly in natural resource extraction and power generation 
driven by strong sales in those markets and the acquisition of jorvex  the wire and cable segment achieved a record fourth quarter 
the company also achieved a significant milestone in its security solutions business  exceeding billion in annual sales for the first time 
the company s outlook for is for low to mid single digit organic revenue growth for the first half of the year improving to mid single digit growth in the second half which the company believes should drive mid to high single digit incremental operating profit leverage 
the company continues to be well positioned to leverage its global supply chain platform through economic cycles 
while global markets are difficult to predict  the company s strategic growth initiatives position it well to expand its leadership position within its segments 
in this more uncertain environment  the company has continued to manage expenses and working capital carefully  while pursuing strategic investments to expand its business 
finally  the company believes that in more challenging economic environments  the company s business model  which is based on helping the company s customers lower their supply chain costs and reduce execution risk  delivers the greatest value to its customers 
the company expects to grow through a combination of the following adding new products to its portfolio  developing a presence in electrical and electronic wire and cable and oem supply in countries where the company s current presence is large but limited primarily to the enterprise cabling and security solutions end market  and selectively expanding the company s geographic presence 
the aggressive and disciplined actions taken in to manage and restructure the company s cost structure and to lower long term pension costs are expected to result in approximately million of annual savings 
coming off a year where the company faced ongoing uncertainty from the global macro environment  it is anticipated that some of the headwinds of  most specifically the delays in enterprise spending and the investment in growth of the wire and cable business  may become tailwinds as the company progresses through consolidated results of operations in millions  except per share amounts years ended december  december  december  net sales gross profit operating expenses impairment of goodwill and long lived assets operating income other expense interest expense net loss on retirement of debt other  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income diluted income per share continuing operations discontinued operations net income items impacting comparability of results in addition to the results provided in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap above  this report includes certain financial measures computed using non gaap components as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec

the company believes that by reporting organic growth which excludes the impact of acquisitions  foreign exchange and copper prices  both management and investors are provided with meaningful supplemental sales information to understand and analyze the company s underlying trends and other aspects of its financial performance 
from time to time  the company may also exclude other items from reported financial results eg  impairment charges  inventory adjustments  restructuring charges  etc

at the end of the second quarter of  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of jorvex  sa jorvex  an electrical wire and cable distributor based in lima  peru 
the company paid million  net of cash acquired  and assumed approximately million in debt 
the acquisition resulted in the allocation of million to goodwill 
as a result of the acquisition of jorvex  sales and operating income were favorably affected in as compared to the prior year by million and million  respectively 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  the company acquired all the outstanding shares of clark security products  inc and the assets and operations of general lock  llc collectively clark 
clark  based in san diego  california  is a distributor of security products and locksmith supplies to commercial  industrial and government entities throughout the united states  with major distribution centers in san diego  california  dallas  texas  sacramento  california  denver  colorado  lexington  kentucky  silver spring  maryland  phoenix  arizona  and kent  washington 
clark s broad array of products includes locking hardware  access control devices  closed circuit television systems  along with various technical support services 
the company paid approximately million for the two companies in offset in by million which was returned to the company as a result of net working capital adjustments 
as a result of the acquisition of clark  sales and operating income were favorably affected in as compared to by million and million  respectively 
the acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and the respective results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisitions 
had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the year of the acquisitions  the company s operating results would not have been significantly different 
the company s operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities  primarily copper  which are components in some of the products sold 
generally  as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices  the company s mark up percentage to customers remains relatively constant  resulting in higher sales revenue and gross profit 
in addition  existing inventory purchased at previously lower prices and sold as prices increase may result in a higher gross profit margin 
conversely  a decrease in commodity prices in a short period of time would have the opposite effect  negatively affecting financial results 
the degree to which spot market copper prices change affects product prices and the amount of gross profit earned will be affected by end market demand and overall economic conditions 
importantly  however  there is no exact measure of the effect of changes in copper prices  as there are thousands of transactions in any given quarter  each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions 
therefore  all references to the effect of copper prices are estimates

in the emerging markets the results were mixed 
the company s ecs segment continued to benefit from strong global trends in security  with the ecs security sales growing by in accounting for of segment sales 
w c the company s strength in wire and cable was global  with organic growth across nearly all geographies  led by organic growth in emerging markets  record sales in canada and continued strength in the us the segment continued to experience solid project activity in the power generation  industrial  oil and gas and mining sectors 
the initiative to expand into industrial automation continued to build momentum with additional products and an expanded vendor base during oem supply the sales decline in reflects reduced production by many of the segment s large customers 
the reductions were primarily driven by weaker demand for customers products  consistent with widely reported industrial production statistics in the us and europe where over of the segment s business is concentrated with each region roughly equal in size 
in the us  oem supply continues to be impacted by the heavy truck industry  which had a soft second half of the europe oem supply business had a similar decline in sales  reflecting the broader and more persistent weakness in the european region

the strategic addition of clark accounted for approximately one third of the segment s sales growth 
geographically  organic sales growth was in north america  a decline of in europe and growth of in the emerging markets as compared to the prior year 
this segment experienced a lower growth rate as compared to oem supply due to both a challenging comparison to the prior year period and a slowdown in billings due to project delays 
w c the on going investments in emerging markets contributed solid growth 
sales increased in this region over as compared to the prior year  as project business remained strong while the day to day business continued to grow as well 
sales in this segment were influenced by strong growth in canada where project business remains very healthy 
this segment experienced a lower growth rate as compared to oem supply  especially in europe  due to both a challenging comparison to the prior year period and a slowdown in billings due to project delays 
oem supply organic sales in north america increased year on year  while europe was up and emerging markets was up 
the global oem supply business continued to benefit from improving demand for capital industrial goods and durable consumer goods combined with market share gains through the addition of new customers and new part sets to existing customers 
gross margin gross margin decreased in to as compared to in the prior two fiscal years 
during  the company recorded an inventory lower of cost or market adjustment of million 
the effects of lower copper prices did not impact gross margin percentages significantly in any year 
the lower margin in versus the prior two years was driven by the wire and cable segment which had the biggest impact on total gross margin  with two major drivers first a product mix shift from its oem vertical market to the industrial market 
the company experienced a mix shift reflecting production declines at its oem customers which is a higher margin market  secondly  within the us and canada industrial business  the company experienced a doubling in the number of projects 
similarly  the segment achieved sizeable growth in large projects in latin america and europe 
while this mix shift was dilutive to margins in the year  the company believes this is an important opportunity to drive margins going forward as the segment increases the supply chain solutions it can offer on its project business 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in to  million in and to  million in operating expenses in include an incremental million related to the clark acquisition  million due to changes in foreign exchange rates as compared to and a million restructuring charge 
operating expenses for include an incremental million related to the jorvex acquisition while changes in foreign exchange rates decreased operating expenses by million as compared to the current year increase in operating expenses include pension and restructuring costs of million which are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

ecs adjusted operating margin was in compared to in the previous year and in persistent weakness in the european economy and a product mix shift as security became an increasing part of the overall sales mix were the primary drivers of the margin decline versus the previous periods 
this segment has also experienced what it believes to be a temporary slowdown in the datacenter market and some pricing pressure in its us business 
w c adjusted operating margin was in both and but in the flat year over year results are largely a result of a mix shift from oem to industrial products in north america and an increase in lower margin project activity outside of the us which has been offset by the lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales 
results since have improved due to the strong growth in this segment and the success that has been achieved in the emerging markets  including the acquisition of jorvex 
oem supply adjusted operating margin was in compared to and in and  respectively 
the weakness in this segment was a result of its exposure to the heavy truck market in the us as well as its significant exposure to manufacturing in the europe region which accounts for nearly of the oem supply business 
in  this segment was negatively impacted by cost pressures in the company s european oem supply business due to significant unilateral cost increases from european based fastener manufacturers resulting from the european union imposition of anti dumping duties on fasteners imported from china 
interest expense and other consolidated interest expense was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense is driven by the million incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of the notes due the company s average cost of debt was  and in   and  respectively 
the company s average cost of debt increase in is due to the issuance of million of notes due to pre fund the retirement of million convertible notes due in february due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies  primarily in latin america where there are few cost effective means of hedging  the company recorded a foreign exchange loss of million in and million in in  the company recorded foreign exchange losses of million 
these losses were offset by a foreign exchange gain of million which was associated with the remeasurement of venezuela s bolivar denominated monetary assets on the venezuelan balance sheet at the parallel exchange rate 
the combined effect of changes in both the equity and bond markets in each of the last three fiscal years resulted in changes in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance policies associated with the company sponsored deferred compensation program 
the company recorded gains on the cash surrender value in and of million and million  respectively 
in  the company recorded a loss of million 
as a result of the retirement of debt in  the company recognized a pre tax loss of million 
income taxes the tax provision on continuing operations for was million compared to million in the prior year and million in during the first quarter of  the company recorded a tax benefit of million primarily related to the reversal of deferred income tax valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the prior year results included a net tax benefit of million primarily related to the reversal of deferred income tax valuation allowances 
the provision includes a reversal of million for prior years foreign taxes 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate for was as compared to in the prior year and in excluding the impact of these items as well as the other items impacting the comparability of results discussed above  the adjusted tax rate in was compared to in the prior year and in the declining adjusted tax rate from is due to the favorable mix of taxable income and changes to the capital structure in several countries

capital commitments for property  plant and equipment are limited to information technology assets  warehouse equipment  office furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  since the company operates almost entirely from leased facilities 
therefore  in any given reporting period  the amount of cash consumed or generated by operations other than from net earnings will primarily be due to changes in working capital as a result of the rate of increases or decreases in sales 
in periods when sales are increasing  the expanded working capital needs will be funded first by cash from operations  then from additional borrowings and lastly from additional equity offerings 
in periods when sales are decreasing  the company will have improved cash flows due to reduced working capital requirements 
during such periods  the company will use the expanded cash flow to reduce the amount of leverage in its capital structure until such time as the outlook for improved economic conditions and growth is clear 
also  the company will  from time to time  issue or retire borrowings or equity in an effort to maintain a cost effective capital structure consistent with its anticipated capital requirements 
net cash provided by operations was million in which compares to million of cash provided by operations in excluding the million contribution to the pension plan to fund the majority of the lump sum payment option offered to terminated vested participants  cash flow provided by operations was million representing an increase of million 
the increase in cash flow provided by operations was due to an improvement in working capital as a percentage of sales 
net cash provided by operating activities in compares to million in the decrease in was due to a change in working capital requirements to support organic sales growth 
consolidated net cash used in investing activities was million 
this compares to net cash provided by investing activities of million in  which included million from the sale of the company s aerospace business offset by million in capital expenditures 
this compares to net cash used in investing activities during of million for the acquisition of clark and capital expenditures 
in  the company paid million  net of cash acquired  and assumed approximately million in debt to acquire jorvex 
capital expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in as the company continues to invest in the consolidation of certain acquired facilities in north america and europe  warehouse equipment  information system upgrades and new software to support its infrastructure 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in the first half of  the company issued million principal amount of notes due and repaid million of borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
this compares to repayments of borrowings of million in the prior year period 
using available borrowings under the company s long term revolving credit facility  the company retired the remainder of its zero coupon convertible notes due notes due for million over the course of and over the last three fiscal years  the company has returned approximately million of excess capital to shareholders through the repurchase of common stock and special dividends 
liquidity and capital resources the company may from time to time repurchase additional amounts of the company s outstanding shares or outstanding debt obligations 
the company maintains the flexibility to utilize future cash flows to invest in the growth of the business  and it believes that the current leverage on the balance sheet positions the company to effectively capitalize on the improved economic environment as well as additional acquisition opportunities when they become available 
the company will continue to balance its focus on sales and earnings growth with continuing efforts in cost control and working capital management 
maintaining a strong and flexible financial position continues to be vital to funding investment in strategic long term growth initiatives 
at the end of fiscal  the company had approximately million in available  committed  unused credit lines with financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings as well as million of outstanding borrowings under its million accounts receivable securitization facility  resulting in over million of available liquidity at the end of with a year end cash balance of million and available committed credit facilities  the company will continue to evaluate the optimal use of these funds 
the company s debt to total capitalization was  and at the end of fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company is in compliance with all of its covenant ratios and believes that there is adequate margin between the covenant ratios and the actual ratios given the current trends of the business 
as of december   the total availability of all revolving lines of credit at anixter inc would be permitted to be borrowed 
for further information  including information regarding the company s credit arrangements  see note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual cash obligations and commitments at the end of fiscal  the company has various contractual cash obligations and commitments and the following table represents the associated payments due by period 
the amounts due by period will not necessarily correlate to amounts reflected as short term and long term liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets at the end of any given period 
this is due to the difference in the recognition of liabilities of non cancellable obligations for accounting purposes at the end of a given period as well giving consideration to the company s intent and ability to settle such contractual commitments that might be considered short term 
payments due by period beyond total in millions debt a contractual interest b purchase obligations c operating leases deferred compensation liability d pension plans e total obligations liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of million were excluded from the table above  as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements with taxing authorities 
various foreign subsidiaries of the company had aggregate cumulative net operating loss nol carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes of approximately million at december   which are subject to various provisions of each respective country 
approximately million of this amount expires between and  and million of the amount has an indefinite life 
see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits 
a the million outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility will mature in the book value of the notes due was million at december  and will accrete to million through maturity on february  the book value of the notes due was million at december  and will accrete to million in borrowings under the company s long term revolving credit facilities of million mature in the notes due and the notes due are million and million  respectively 
b interest payments on debt outstanding at december  through maturity 
for variable rate debt  the company computed contractual interest payments based on the borrowing rate at december  c purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for products sourced from unaffiliated third party suppliers  in addition to commitments related to various capital expenditures 
many of these obligations may be cancelled with limited or no financial penalties 
d a non qualified deferred compensation plan was implemented on january  the plan provides for benefit payments upon retirement  death  disability  termination or other scheduled dates determined by the participant 
at december   the deferred compensation liability was million 
in an effort to ensure that adequate resources are available to fund the deferred compensation liability  the company has purchased variable  separate account life insurance policies on the plan participants with benefits accruing to the company 
at december   the cash surrender value of these company life insurance policies was million 
e the majority of the company s various pension plans are non contributory and cover substantially all full time domestic employees and certain employees in other countries 
retirement benefits are provided based on compensation as defined in the plans 
the company s policy is to fund these plans as required by the employee retirement income security act  the internal revenue service and local statutory law 
at december   the current portion of the company s net pension liability of million was million 
the company currently estimates that it will be required to contribute million to its foreign and domestic pension plans in due to the future impact of various market conditions  rates of return and changes in plan participants  the company cannot provide a meaningful estimate of its future contributions beyond critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following are critical areas of accounting that either require significant judgment by management or may be affected by changes in general market conditions outside the control of management 
as a result  changes in estimates and general market conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
historically  with the exception of the goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges in and  the company s estimates in these critical areas have not differed materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and december   the company reported net accounts receivable of  million and  million  respectively 
the company carries its accounts receivable at their face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts which was million and million at the end of and  respectively 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances  as well as credit conditions and history of write offs and collections 
each quarter the company segregates the doubtful receivable balances into the following major categories and determines the bad debt reserve required as outlined below customers that are no longer paying their balances are reserved based on the historical write off percentages  risk accounts are individually reviewed and the reserve is based on the probability of potential default 
the company continually monitors payment patterns of customers  investigates past due accounts to assess the likelihood of collection and monitors industry and economic trends to estimate required allowances  and the outstanding balance for customers who have declared bankruptcy is reserved at the outstanding balance less the estimated net realizable value 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced or increased by a material amount 
inventory obsolescence at december  and december   the company reported inventory of  million and  million  respectively net of inventory reserves of million and million  respectively 
each quarter the company reviews for excess inventories and makes an assessment of the net realizable value 
there are many factors that management considers in determining whether or not the amount by which a reserve should be established 
these factors include the following return or rotation privileges with vendors price protection from vendors expected future usage whether or not a customer is obligated by contract to purchase the inventory current market pricing historical consumption experience risk of obsolescence if circumstances related to the above factors change  there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of the inventories 
pension expense accounting rules related to pensions and the policies used by the company generally reduce the recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the net benefit cost  as any significant actuarial gains losses are amortized over the remaining service lives of the plan participants 
these actuarial gains and losses are mainly attributable to the return on plan assets that differ from that assumed and differences in the obligation due to changes in the discount rate  plan demographic changes and other assumptions 
a significant element in determining the company s net periodic benefit cost in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles us gaap is the expected return on plan assets 
for  the company had assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be 
this expected return on plan assets is included in the net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year ended as a result of the combined effect of valuation changes in both the equity and bond markets  the plan assets produced an actual gain of approximately in as compared to a gain of in as a result  the fair value of plan assets is million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal when the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is significant  the difference is amortized into expense over the service lives of the plan participants 
these amounts are reflected on the balance sheet through charges to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the measurement date for all plans of the company is december st 
accordingly  at the end of each fiscal year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities to their present value 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate at the end of and  the company reviewed rates of return on relevant market indices ie  the citigroup pension liability index 
these rates are adjusted to match the duration of the liabilities associated with the pension plans 
at december  and december   the company determined the consolidated weighted average rate of all plans to be and  respectively  and used this rate to measure the projected benefit obligation at the end of each respective fiscal year end 
the decrease in the discount rate and the weakening of the us dollar has increased the projected benefit obligation 
partially offsetting this increase are the pension plan changes outlined below 
as a result  the projected benefit obligation increased to million at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal the company s consolidated net pension liability was million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the end of in the fourth quarter of  the company took two actions related to the anixter inc pension plan in the united states that will reduce future expenses and contributions 
first  the company offered a one time lump sum payment option to terminated vested participants that resulted in million of additional contributions by the company to fund million of payments 
this resulted in a settlement charge of million related to the immediate recognition of actuarial losses accumulated in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
the additional contributions of million were made using excess cash from operations  positively influencing the funded status of the plan 
second  the company made changes to its existing us defined benefit plan which are effective as of december  that freeze benefits provided to employees hired on or before june  this change resulted in a remeasurement of the projected benefit obligation  resulting in a reduction of the balance by million in the fourth quarter of these employees will be covered under the personal retirement account pension formula described more fully in note pension plans  post retirement benefits and other benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
due to the settlement charge in the fourth quarter of  and a decline in the consolidated weighted average discount rate from in to in  the company recognized a consolidated pre tax net periodic cost of million in  up from million in excluding the settlement charge  the company estimates its net periodic cost to decrease approximately to primarily due to the amendment described above 
the combination of these changes to the pension plan and the restructuring actions outlined in note restructuring charge will drive approximately million in annual costs savings beginning immediately 
due to its long duration  the pension liability is very sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decline in the assumed discount rate would result in an increase in the pension expense of approximately million and an increase in the projected benefit obligations at december  of million 
a basis point decline in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in an increase in the expense of approximately million 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in september  the fasb issued new guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment  giving companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and  in some cases  skip the two step impairment test 
the qualitative assessment considers specific factors  based on the weight of evidence  and the significance of all identified events and circumstances in the context of determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the company utilized the qualitative assessment approach to test goodwill for impairment during the annual assessment performed in the third quarter 
in addition to the qualitative approach  the company also performed a combination of the quantitative evaluation of the income and market approach to determine the fair value of the company s former european segment 
as a result of the change in segments in the fourth quarter of and in accordance with asc related to goodwill and intangibles  the company was required to reassign the carrying amount of goodwill to its new reporting units based on the relative fair value assigned as of the effective date of the company s change in segment reporting in the fourth quarter of an interim assessment of the recoverability of goodwill assigned to the reporting units was necessitated as a result of this change 
in connection with the company s fourth quarter interim assessment to test for goodwill impairment  the company utilized a combination of the income and market approach  both of which are broadly defined below 
for further information  see note impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
the income approach is a quantitative evaluation to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
under the income approach the company determined the fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return a market participant would expect to earn 
the inputs used for the income approach were significant unobservable inputs  or level inputs  as described in the accounting fair value hierarchy 
estimated future cash flows were based on the company s internal projection models  industry projections and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management 
the market approach measures the fair value of a reporting unit through the analysis of recent sales  offerings  and financial multiples sales or ebitda of comparable businesses 
consideration is given to the financial conditions and operating performance of the reporting unit being valued relative to those publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using the qualitative assessment  the company performs the two step impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using the income approach and or the market approach as described above 
if step one of the test indicates a carrying value above the estimated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
other than goodwill  the company does not have any material indefinite lived intangible assets 
the company s long lived assets consists of definite lived intangible assets which are primarily related to customer relationships  as well as property and equipment which consists of office furniture and equipment  computer software and hardware  warehouse equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its long lived assets warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators are present  the company assesses whether the future estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are greater than their carrying amounts 
if these future estimated cash flows are less than carrying value  the company then measures an impairment loss for the amount that carrying value exceeds fair value of the assets 
at the end of fiscal  the company expects the carrying amount of goodwill  allocated to each of its segments  and its long lived assets to be fully recoverable 
deferred tax assets at december  and december   the company s allowance for deferred tax assets was million and million  respectively 
the company maintains valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances are included in the company s tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
assessments are made at each balance sheet date to determine how much of each deferred tax asset is realizable 
these estimates are subject to change in the future  particularly if earnings of a particular subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected  or if management takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 
uncertain tax positions in the normal course of business  the company is audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions 
the company recognizes the benefit of tax positions when a benefit is more likely than not ie  greater than likely to be sustained on its technical merits 
recognized tax benefits are measured at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained  based on cumulative probability  in final settlement of the position 
the company s effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
as of december   the aggregate amount of global uncertain tax position liabilities and related interest and penalties recorded was approximately million 
the uncertain tax positions cover a range of issues  including intercompany charges and withholding taxes  and involve numerous different taxing jurisdictions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rate changes  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be highly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item eg  various foreign currency denominated accounts 
the company s counterparties to its derivative contracts have investment grade credit ratings 
the company expects the creditworthiness of its counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in other  net in the company s consolidated statements of income 
during periods of volatility in foreign exchange rates  the company can be subject to significant foreign exchange gains and losses since there is a time lag between when the company incurs the foreign exchange exposure and when the company has the information to properly hedge the exposure 
foreign exchange risk the company s foreign currency denominated sales were in  in and in the company s exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relate to europe euro and british pound and canada canadian dollar 
the company also has exposure to currency rate fluctuations related to more volatile markets such as argentina peso  australia dollar  brazil real  chile peso  colombia peso  mexico peso and venezuela bolivar 
the company s investments in several subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at the end of each period during consolidation using period end exchange rates  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
these fluctuations and the results of operations for foreign subsidiaries  where the functional currency is not the us dollar  are translated into us dollars using the average exchange rates during the year  while the assets and liabilities are translated using period end exchange rates 
the assets and liabilities related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  foreign currency translation  which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  as the company s subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in currencies other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur 
borrowings are raised in certain foreign currencies to minimize the exchange rate translation adjustment risk 
several of the company s subsidiaries conduct business in a currency other than the legal entity s functional currency 
transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid 
a change in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of functional currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction 
that increase or decrease in expected functional currency cash flows is a foreign exchange transaction gain or loss that is included in other  net in the consolidated statements of income 
the company purchases foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currency denominated accounts on its reported income 
the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
at december  and december   the notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its foreign currency forward contracts assuming a adverse change in the value of foreign currency contracts outstanding 
the hypothetical adverse changes would have resulted in the company recording a million and million loss in fiscal and  respectively 
however  as these forward contracts are intended to be perfectly effective economic hedges  the company would record offsetting gains as a result of the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary accounts being hedged 
venezuela foreign exchange the company s functional currency for financial reporting purposes in venezuela is the us dollar usd 
inventory is sourced from vendors in the united states including the parent company of the venezuelan subsidiary  anixter inc and paid for in usd 
sales to customers are invoiced in the local bolivar currency and bolivars are collected from customers to settle outstanding receivables 
since  local government restrictions have made it increasingly difficult to transfer cash out of venezuela 
historically  the company utilized the parallel market which involves using bolivars to purchase venezuelan securities and then swapping those securities for usd denominated investments to obtain usd to settle usd liabilities  which resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange rates as compared with the official rate in venezuela 
as a result of the factors that led to increased usage of the parallel market  including cash remittance to the parent  the company re evaluated its historical practice of remeasuring bolivar denominated monetary assets primarily cash and accounts receivable into usd using the official exchange rate for financial reporting purposes 
as a result of this re evaluation  the company concluded that the use of the parallel rate for remeasurement purposes was most appropriate 
in  the venezuelan government suspended trading in the parallel market and replaced it with a system called transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme  under the control of the central bank of venezuela 
under the new regulations  the company is limited to converting the venezuelan bolivar to usd at a rate of  per day  up to a maximum of  per month  as permitted by the central bank of venezuela 
the bolivar to usd exchange rate under sitme was adjusted to bolivars to one usd in the second quarter of  resulting in a pre tax foreign exchange gain of million 
the bolivar to usd exchange rate was bolivars to one usd at the end of  and through the end of fiscal  the rate at which the company obtained permission to repatriate cash through sitme varied and was determined by the central bank 
the rate reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements has been the average exchange rate obtained during the reporting period for transactions that the company executes through sitme 
the company received small approval amounts from the regulatory authority in venezuela at rates of  however  the company has not historically considered this representative of the rate at which it can repatriate significant cash in a consistent manner 
therefore  the company has not used the official rate for us gaap accounting 
in february  the venezuela government announced a devaluation of the bolivar from the rate of bolivars to one usd to bolivars to one usd 
in addition  venezuelan officials announced that they would be discontinuing the sitme system 
the company believes that the new official rate of bolivars to one usd will be the rate that the company will be allowed to use to repatriate cash from venezuela 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this change but it is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
for further information  see note subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk at december   the company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   the company had gbp million of notional amount outstanding in an interest rate swap agreement 
the company used the interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with the objective of converting variable interest to fixed interest associated with forecasted interest payments resulting from revolving borrowings in the uk and were designated as hedging instruments 
the company does not enter into interest rate swaps for speculative purposes 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was determined by means of a mathematical model that calculated the present value of the anticipated cash flows from the transaction using mid market prices and other economic data and assumptions  or by means of pricing indications from one or more other dealers selected at the discretion of the respective banks 
these inputs would be considered level in the fair value hierarchy described in accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
at december   the interest rate swap was revalued at then current interest rates  with the changes in valuation reflected directly in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the fair market value of the company s previous interest rate agreement  which was the estimated exit price that the company would pay to cancel the interest rate agreement  was not significant at december  fair market value of debt instruments the fair value of the company s debt instruments is measured using observable market information which would be considered level in the fair value hierarchy described in recently issued accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
the carrying value of the company s nonconvertible fixed rate debt specifically  notes due  notes due and notes due was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the fair value of the nonconvertible fixed rate debt instruments was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s notes due  notes due and notes due bear interest at a fixed rate of  and  respectively 
therefore  changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the nonconvertible fixed rate debt but interest rates do affect the fair value 
if interest rates were to increase by  the fair market value of the nonconvertible fixed rate debt would decrease by and at december  and december   respectively 
if interest rates were to decrease by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would increase by and at december  and december   respectively 
the carrying value of the company s outstanding convertible fixed rate debt specifically  notes due was million at december  and million at december  during  the company retired its notes due as a result of repurchases and bondholder conversions 
as the company s outstanding convertible fixed rate debt may be converted into the company s common stock  the price of the company s common stock may affect the fair value of the company s convertible debt 
the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding convertible debt decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decline in the estimated fair value of the company s convertible debt is primarily due to the stock price during fiscal a hypothetical increase in the price of the company s common stock from the price at december  and december  would have increased the fair value of its then outstanding convertible debt by million and million  respectively 
changes in the fair market value of the company s debt do not affect the reported results of operations unless the company is retiring such obligations prior to their maturity 
this analysis did not consider the effects of a changed level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
see note summary of significant accounting policies interest rate agreements and foreign currency translation and note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on interest rate agreements and outstanding debt obligations
