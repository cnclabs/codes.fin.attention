the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our most significant accounting policies relate to the sale  purchase  and promotion of our products and services 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from the sale of products ie  server  storage  and point of sale hardware  and software  support  maintenance and subscription services and professional services 
revenue is recorded in the period in which the goods are delivered or services are rendered and when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we reduce revenue for estimated discounts  sales incentives  estimated customer returns  and other allowances 
discounts are offered based on the volume of products and services purchased by customers 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold 
revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies 
we frequently enter into multiple element arrangements with customers including hardware  software  professional consulting services and maintenance support services 
for arrangements involving multiple deliverables  when deliverables include software and non software products and services  we evaluate and separate each deliverable to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting based on the following criteria a the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and b if the contract includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control 
for arrangements entered into or materially modified after april   consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the unit relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to each deliverable i vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of selling price besp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable 
vsoe is established for our software maintenance services and we use tpe or besp to establish selling prices for our non software related services 
besp is primarily used for elements that are not consistently priced within a narrow range or tpe is not available 
we determine besp for a deliverable by considering multiple factors including product class  geography  average discount  and management historical pricing practices 
amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and software elements are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
amounts allocated to the undelivered maintenance and other services elements are recognized as the services are provided or on a straight line basis over the service period 
in certain instances  customer acceptance is required prior to the passage of title and risk of loss of the delivered products 
in such cases  revenue is not recognized until the customer acceptance is obtained 
delivery and acceptance generally occur in the same reporting period 
for arrangements entered into prior to april   we have not applied besp 
in such arrangements  if we have the requisite evidence of selling price for the undelivered elements but not for the delivered elements  we apply the residual method to allocate arrangement consideration 
in situations where our solutions contain software that is more than incidental  revenue related to the software and software related elements is recognized in accordance with authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition 
for the software and software related elements of such transactions  revenue is allocated based on the relative fair value of each element  and fair value is determined by vsoe 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  but fair value exists for the undelivered elements  we use the residual method to recognize revenue 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
revenue recognition for complex contractual arrangements  especially those with multiple elements  requires a significant level of judgment and is based upon a review of specific contracts  past experience  the selling price of undelivered elements when sold separately  creditworthiness of customers  international laws and other factors 
changes in judgments about these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized between periods 
revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled 
a majority of our hardware sales involves shipment directly from its suppliers to the end user customers 
in these transactions  we are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer  and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods 
as the principal contact with the customer  we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
in certain limited instances  as shipping terms dictate  revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site 
we offer proprietary software as well as remarketed software for sale to our customers 
we offer our customers the right to license the software under a variety of models 
our customers can license our software under a perpetual model for an upfront fee or a subscription model 
for subscription arrangements  we allow customers the right to use software  receive unspecified products as well as unspecified upgrades and enhancements and entitle the customer to receive hosting services for a specified term 
the subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically three to five years 
revenue from subscription service arrangements is included in support  maintenance and subscription services in the consolidated statements of operations 
a majority of our software sales do not require significant production  modification  or customization at the time of shipment physically or electronically to the customer 
substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
as such  revenue from both proprietary and remarketed software sales is typically recognized when the software has been shipped 
for software delivered electronically  delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer either takes possession of the software via downloading or has been provided with the requisite codes that allow for immediate access to the software based on the us eastern time zone time stamp 
we also offer proprietary and third party services to our customers 
proprietary services generally include consulting  installation  integration and training 
many of our software arrangements include consulting services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts 
when the arrangements qualify as service transactions  consulting revenue from these arrangements are accounted for separately from the software revenue 
the significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of the services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments  and the impact of milestones or other customer acceptance criteria on revenue realization 
if there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for consulting services  the revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
for certain long term proprietary service contracts with fixed or not to exceed fee arrangements  we estimate proportional performance using the hours incurred as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project consistent with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
accordingly  revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the proportion of the work performed on the contract 
if there is no sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion  the revenue is recognized when final customer acceptance is received 
adjustments to contract price and estimated service hours are made periodically  and losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined 
the aggregate of collections on uncompleted contracts in excess of related revenue is shown as a current liability 
if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software and consulting services  then the software revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentage of completion or completed contract method of accounting 
contract accounting is applied to arrangements that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect the collection of revenue  significant modification or customization of the software  or provisions that tie the payment for the software to the performance of consulting services 
we also offer proprietary and third party support to our customers 
support generally includes support and maintenance of software and hardware products and subscription services 
revenue relating to proprietary support services is recognized evenly over the coverage period of the underlying agreement within support  maintenance and subscription revenue 
in instances where we offer third party support contracts to our customer  the supplier is the primary obligor in the transaction although we bear credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer 
since we are acting as an agent or broker with respect to such sales transactions  we report revenue at the time of the sale  only in the amount of the commission equal to the selling price less the cost of sale received rather than reporting revenue in the full amount of the selling price with separate reporting of the cost of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk  as well as historical trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to mitigate this credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  net of related reserves 
the cost of inventory is computed using a weighted average costing method 
our inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation 
adjustments of inventories to lower of cost or market  if necessary  are based upon contractual provisions governing turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
we provide a reserve for obsolescence  which is calculated based on several factors including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
income taxes 
income tax expense includes us and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march  and million as of march   related to substantially all of our deferred income tax assets in jurisdictions where there is uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of a benefit from those assets 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the tax valuation allowance would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made 
we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
no tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold 
interest related to uncertain tax positions is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized 
our income taxes are described further in note to consolidated financial statements titled  income taxes 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually  unless it is determined after a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount 
goodwill is measured for impairment on an annual basis  or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist 
for fiscal  we conducted a qualitative assessment step zero analysis to determine whether it would be necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
it was determined based on the step zero analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the hsg business segment exceeded its carrying amount as of february  in prior years  we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test on february st of each fiscal year 
the fair values of the reporting units for fiscal were estimated using a combination of an income approach and a market approach  weighted and  respectively 
the income approach is based on projected future debt free cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows 
this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit expected long term operating and cash flow performance 
the income approach is based on a reporting unit projection of operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital 
the projection is based upon our best estimate of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates  estimate of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements based on management projections 
the market approach is based on direct transactional evidence  or where such transactional evidence does not exist  the observed earnings and revenue trading multiples  or equity value  or enterprise value of comparable peer group companies is used 
the reporting units are assessed based on qualitative and quantitative comparisons against the peer group  including size  expected growth  profitability  and product diversification 
this approach provides that if the respective reporting unit is comparable to the peer group  then a similar multiple of equity value is a reasonable indication of the value of the reporting unit 
we believe this methodology provides reasonable estimates of a reporting unit fair value and that this estimate is consistent with how a market participant would view the reporting unit fair value 
fair value computed by this methodology is arrived at using a number of factors  including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping  and the cost of capital 
we weigh the income approach more heavily than the market approach in its analysis because management believes that there is not a strong comparability with the peer group companies  and therefore  the income approach provides a better measure of fair value 
there are inherent uncertainties  however  related to these factors and to management judgment in applying them to this analysis 
nonetheless  we believe that this method provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units 
our goodwill and long lived assets are described further in note to consolidated financial statements titled  goodwill and intangible assets 
restructuring charges 
we recognize restructuring charges when a plan that materially changes the scope of our business  or the manner in which that business is conducted  is adopted and communicated to the impacted parties  and the expenses have been incurred or are reasonably estimable 
our restructuring reserves principally include estimates related to employee separation costs and the consolidation and impairment of facilities that will no longer be used in continuing operations 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
facility reserves are calculated using a present value of future minimum lease payments  offset by an estimate for future sublease income provided by external brokers 
present value is calculated using a credit adjusted risk free rate with a maturity equivalent to the lease term 
share based compensation 
we have a stock incentive plan under which we may grant non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  stock settled stock appreciation rights  time vested restricted shares  restricted share units  performance vested restricted shares  and performance shares 
shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares 
we record compensation expense related to stock options  stock settled stock appreciation rights  restricted shares  and performance shares granted to certain employees and non employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date 
the fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date 
the fair value of stock option and stock settled appreciation right awards is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing model  which includes assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  dividend yield  life of the award  and the volatility of our common shares 
additional information regarding the assumptions used to value share based compensation awards is provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements titled  share based compensation 
capitalized software development costs 
we capitalize certain costs related to the development of computer software 
capitalization of these costs begins when a detail program design or working model has been produced as evidenced by the completion of design  planning  coding and testing  such that the product meets its design specifications and has thereby established technological feasibility 
capitalization of these costs ends when the resulting product is available for general release to the public 
amortization of the capitalized software is classified within products cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
for each capitalized software product  the annual amortization is equal to the greater of i the amount computed using the ratio that the software product s current fiscal year gross revenue bears to the total current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or ii the amount computed based on straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  which is a range between three and eight years 
the amount by which unamortized software costs exceeds the net realizable value  if any  is recognized as a charge to income in the period it is determined 
we capitalized approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized software was million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb  issued accounting standards update  asu  no 
 testing for goodwill impairment  which modifies the process of testing goodwill for impairment 
the update will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines it is more likely than not  based on a qualitative assessment  the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
the guidance also includes a number of events and circumstances to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we adopted this guidance as of april  and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which modifies the requirements for presenting net income and other comprehensive income and requires that all non owner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendment requires presentation of each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb issued amendments to the guidance to allow the fasb time to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income in all periods presented 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  we adopted this guidance april  and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is then necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value 
otherwise  the quantitative impairment test is not required 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  and early adoption is permitted 
asu no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which modifies the disclosure requirements for offsetting financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements and the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
we adopted this guidance on january   and it did not have impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which amends certain provisions in asc comprehensive income 
these provisions require the disclosure of significant amounts that are reclassified out of other comprehensive income into net income in its entirety during the reporting period 
these provisions are effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance as of april  and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 
management continually evaluates the potential impact  if any  of all recent accounting pronouncements on its financial position  results of operations  cash flows  or related disclosures and  if significant  makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have assets  liabilities  and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk 
we sell products and services internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  we are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements 
for the fiscal years  and  revenue from international operations was  and  respectively of total revenue 
the effects of foreign currency on operating results did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the  and fiscal years 
at march   a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar would not materially affect our financial statements 
we believe that inflation has had a nominal effect on our results of operations in fiscal years  and and do not expect inflation to be a significant factor in fiscal 
table of contents until july  we maintained a million loan and security agreement with bank of america  na  as lender  dated may  credit facility 
we terminated the credit facility in july in conjunction with the sale of tsg 
as a result of the proceeds that we received from the sale of tsg  we determined that we no longer required the liquidity provided by the credit facility 
as a result of the termination of the credit facility  we expensed approximately million in unamortized deferred financing fees that related to the credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal
