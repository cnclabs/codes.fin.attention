item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a master limited partnership operating in the midstream portion of the natural gas and ngls industry  providing transportation  storage  gathering and processing services for those commodities 
our pipeline systems originate in the gulf coast region  oklahoma and arkansas and extend north and east to the midwestern states of tennessee  kentucky  illinois  indiana and ohio 
we own and operate natural gas and ngls pipelines  including integrated storage facilities 
our pipeline systems originate in the gulf coast region  oklahoma and arkansas  and extend northeasterly to the midwestern states of tennessee  kentucky  illinois  indiana and ohio 
our pipeline systems contain approximately  miles of interconnected natural gas pipelines  directly serving customers in thirteen states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern us through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines and more than miles of ngl pipelines serving customers in louisiana 
in  our pipeline systems transported approximately tcf of natural gas and approximately mmbbls of ngls 
average daily throughput on our natural gas pipeline systems during was approximately bcf 
our natural gas storage facilities are comprised of fourteen underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately bcf and our ngls storage facilities located in louisiana consist of eight salt dome caverns with a storage capacity of mmbbls 
we also have two salt dome caverns for use in providing brine supply services and to support ngls cavern operations 
we conduct all of our business through our operating subsidiaries as one reportable segment 
our transportation services consist of firm natural gas transportation  whereby the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at certain receipt and delivery points along our pipeline systems  plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported  and interruptible natural gas transportation  whereby the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used 
we offer firm natural gas storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity  including injection and withdrawal rights  and interruptible storage and pal services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used 
some pal agreements are paid for at inception of the service and revenues for these agreements are recognized as service is provided over the term of the agreement 
our ngls contracts are generally fee based and are dependent on actual volumes transported or stored  although in some cases minimum volume requirements apply 
our ngls storage rates are market based rates and contracts are typically fixed price arrangements with escalation clauses 
we are not in the business of buying and selling natural gas and ngls other than for system management purposes  but changes in the level of natural gas and ngls prices may impact the volumes of gas transported and stored on our pipeline systems 
our operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of products transported  with the exception of fuel consumed at our compressor stations  which is included in fuel and gas transportation expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
recent developments in october  we acquired louisiana midstream from pl logistics  llc for million in cash  subject to customary adjustments and net of cash acquired 
the purchase price was funded through borrowings under a term loan facility and our revolving credit facility and through the issuance and sale of common units 
louisiana midstream provides salt dome storage  pipeline transportation  fractionation and brine supply services for producers and consumers of petrochemicals  ngls and natural gas through two hubs in southern louisiana  the choctaw hub in the mississippi river corridor and the sulphur hub in the lake charles area 
the assets have approximately mmbbls of salt dome storage capacity  including bcf of working natural gas storage capacity  significant brine supply infrastructure  and more than miles of pipeline transportation assets  including an extensive ethylene distribution system in louisiana 
refer to item for further discussion of our projects 
market conditions and contract renewals the amount of natural gas being produced from unconventional natural gas production areas has greatly increased in recent years 
this dynamic drove the pipeline industry  including us  to construct substantial new pipeline infrastructure to support this development 
however  the oversupply of gas from these and other production areas has resulted in gas prices that are substantially lower than in recent years  which has caused producers to scale back production to levels below those that were expected when the new infrastructure was built 
in addition  certain of these new supply basins  such as the marcellus and utica shale plays  are closer to the traditional high value markets served by interstate pipelines like us  a development that has further affected how natural gas moves across the interstate pipeline grid 
these factors have led to increased competition in certain pipeline markets  as well as substantially narrower price differentials than previous years between producing supply areas  and market areas basis spreads  which has put significant downward pressure on pricing for both firm and interruptible transportation capacity that we are currently marketing 
we do not expect basis spreads on our system to improve in the current year 
as of december   a substantial portion of our transportation capacity was contracted for under firm transportation agreements having a weighted average remaining life of approximately years 
however  each year a portion of our firm transportation agreements expire and must be renewed or replaced 
we renewed or replaced contracts for most of the firm transportation capacity that expired in  though on average at lower rates 
the amount of contracted transportation capacity which will expire in is greater than in recent years 
in light of the market conditions discussed above  we expect that transportation contracts we renew or enter into in will be at lower rates than our expiring contracts 
remaining available capacity will be marketed and sold on a short term firm or interruptible basis  which will also be at lower rates  based on current market conditions 
we expect that these circumstances will negatively affect our transportation revenues  ebitda and distributable cash flows in the market for storage and pal services is also impacted by the factors discussed above  as well as by natural gas price differentials between time periods  such as winter to summer time period price spreads 
time period price spreads declined from to and improved in the first half of  however  we believe that current forward pricing curves indicate that the spreads for may not be as favorable 
forward pricing curves change frequently as a result of a variety of market factors including weather  levels of storage gas  and available capacity  among others and as such may not be a reliable predictor of actual future events 
accordingly  we cannot predict our future revenues from interruptible storage and pal services due to the uncertainty and volatility in market conditions discussed above 
pipeline system maintenance we incur substantial costs for ongoing maintenance of our pipeline systems and related facilities  including those incurred for pipeline integrity management activities  equipment overhauls  general upkeep and repairs 
phmsa has developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas 
these regulations have resulted in an overall increase in our ongoing maintenance costs 
due to recent widely known incidents that have occurred on certain pipelines in the us  it is possible that phmsa may develop more stringent regulations 
we could incur significant additional costs if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety requirements are implemented 
results of operations in the fourth quarter  hp storage  a joint venture between us and bphc  acquired the assets of petal  hattiesburg and related entities 
effective february   we acquired bphc equity ownership interest in hp storage  which was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control 
our financial statements have been recast as though we had fully consolidated hp storage from the beginning of the reporting period during which hp storage was under common control 
compared with our net income for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net income was primarily the result of the acquisitions of hp storage and louisiana midstream  items which negatively impacted the period  and other items noted below 
operating revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to  million  compared to  million for the year ended december  the increase was due to million of revenues from hp storage and louisiana midstream and higher pal and storage revenues of million  resulting from improved market conditions 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in retained fuel of million primarily due to lower natural gas prices 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers of the decrease were lower fuel costs of million primarily due to lower natural gas prices  lower administrative and general expenses of million as a result of cost management activities  particularly with regard to outside services  corporate fees and labor and million lower operation and maintenance expenses primarily from lower maintenance project costs and outside services 
these decreases were partially offset by million of expenses incurred by the acquired entities  million of which was from depreciation and amortization 
we also recorded million of asset impairment charges in  of which million was related to our owensboro  kentucky  office facilities and the remainder related to the expected retirement of certain small diameter pipeline assets 
the period was unfavorably impacted by an impairment charge of million related to materials and supplies which were subsequently sold  a million charge related to a fire at our carthage compressor station and a million natural gas storage loss at our bistineau facility  and favorably impacted by million of gains from the sale of storage gas 
total other deductions for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  driven by a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt recognized in the period  partially offset by higher interest expense of million resulting from increased debt levels in and interest rate derivatives 
compared with our net income for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net income was a result of a charge related to our materials and supplies  decreased pal and storage revenues  increased operations and maintenance expenses and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt 
these unfavorable impacts to net income were partially offset by higher gas transportation revenues from increased capacities 
operating revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to  million  compared to  million for the year ended december  gas transportation revenues  excluding fuel  increased million primarily from increased capacities resulting from the completion of several compression projects in  operating our fayetteville lateral at its design capacity and the acquisition of hp storage 
pal and storage revenues decreased million due to decreased parking opportunities from unfavorable natural gas price spreads between time periods and fuel retained decreased million primarily due to lower natural gas prices 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  in  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to materials and supplies  most of which was subsequently sold 
operation and maintenance expenses increased by million primarily due to maintenance projects for pipeline integrity management and reliability spending and lower amounts of labor capitalized from fewer growth projects 
other drivers for the increased operating expenses were higher depreciation and property taxes of million associated with an increase in our asset base  reduced gains from the sale of storage gas of million and million incurred by hp storage  including acquisition costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower fuel consumed of million primarily due to lower natural gas prices 
total other deductions increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  driven by a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and higher interest expense of million resulting from higher average interest rates on our long term debt and lower capitalized interest 
liquidity and capital resources we are a partnership holding company and derive all of our operating cash flow from our operating subsidiaries 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities  our revolving credit facility  debt issuances and sales of limited partner units 
our operating subsidiaries use cash from their respective operations to fund their operating activities and maintenance capital requirements  service their indebtedness and make advances or distributions to boardwalk pipelines 
boardwalk pipelines uses cash provided from the operating subsidiaries and  as needed  borrowings under our revolving credit facility to service outstanding indebtedness and make distributions or advances to us to fund our distributions to unitholders 
we have no material guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties 
capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million million and million 
growth capital expenditures  including costs associated with our expansion projects  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and we expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately million in  including approximately million for maintenance capital  million of which will be related to pipeline integrity management 
our more significant growth projects for consist of southeast market expansion we expect to spend approximately million to construct an interconnection between our gulf south and hp storage subsidiaries  add additional compression facilities to our system and construct approximately miles of inch and inch pipeline in southeastern mississippi  of which we expect to spend approximately million in south texas eagle ford expansion we expect to spend approximately million to construct a gathering pipeline and a cryogenic processing plant in south texas  of which we spent approximately million in and expect to spend million in to complete the project 
natural gas salt dome storage project in  we expect to place into service approximately bcf of additional working gas capacity associated with the development of a salt dome natural gas storage cavern 
we spent million in capital expenditures on this project in and expect to spend million in to complete the project 
choctaw brine supply expansion projects we are engaged in two brine supply service expansion projects 
the first project consists of developing a one million barrel brine pond  which was placed into service january we spent million on the project in and expect to spend million in the second project consists of constructing miles of inch pipeline from our facilities to a petrochemical customer plant 
we spent million on the project in and expect to spend million in to complete the project 
refer to item for further discussion of these projects 
equity and debt financing we anticipate that our existing capital resources  including our revolving credit facility and future cash flows will be adequate to fund our operations  including our maintenance capital expenditures 
we may seek to access the capital markets to fund some or all of our growth capital expenditures  acquisitions or for general corporate purposes  including to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  a significant amount of which matures in the next five years 
in our recent acquisitions of louisiana midstream and hp storage  loews contributed a substantial portion of the equity capital necessary to complete the purchase 
we subsequently purchased loews equity interest in the acquired companies using proceeds from public offerings of our units  as discussed below 
loews has no obligation to provide financing or other capital support to us for acquisitions  expansion or growth projects or otherwise and loews may not be able or willing to provide capital for future transactions that we may wish to pursue 
our ability to access the capital markets for equity and debt financing under reasonable terms depends on our financial condition  credit ratings and market conditions 
in november  we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting initial purchaser discounts and offering expenses of million from the sale of million of senior unsecured notes of boardwalk pipelines due february  we used the proceeds to repay all borrowings outstanding under our subordinated loan agreement and to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in october  we completed a public offering of million of our common units at a price of per unit 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million and including a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
the net proceeds were used to acquire louisiana midstream and to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in october  our boardwalk acquisition company  llc  subsidiary entered into a million  variable rate term loan due october  the proceeds of the term loan were used to finance the acquisition of louisiana midstream 
interest on the term loan is payable monthly at a rate that is based on the one month libor rate plus an applicable margin 
in august  we completed a public offering of million of our common units at a price of per unit 
we received net cash proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million and including a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in june  we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting initial purchaser discounts and offering expenses of million from the sale of million of senior unsecured notes of gulf south due june  notes 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to redeem gulf south notes due august in february  we completed a public offering of million of our common units at a price of per unit 
we received net cash proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million and including a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which increased our available borrowing capacity under the facility 
revolving credit facility as of december   we had million of loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of and no letters of credit issued thereunder 
as of february   we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million  resulting in available borrowing capacity of million 
the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants and other usual and customary terms and conditions  including the incurrence of additional debt  the sale of assets and sale leaseback transactions 
the financial covenants under the credit facility require us and our subsidiaries to maintain  among other things  a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the amended credit agreement measured for the previous twelve months of not more than to  or up to to for the three quarters following an acquisition 
we and our subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenant requirements under the credit facility as of december  note in item of this report contains more information regarding our revolving credit facility 
retirement of debt in november  we repaid million which was outstanding under our subordinated loan agreement with bphc using proceeds received from our november debt offering 
there is no additional borrowing capacity remaining under the subordinated loan agreement 
in september  we repaid in full hp storage million variable rate term loan due december   and have no further available borrowing capacity under that term loan 
the retirement of this debt was financed through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in august  million aggregate principal amount of gulf south notes due matured and were retired in full 
the retirement of this debt was financed through the issuance of the notes discussed above 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes significant contractual cash payment obligations under firm commitments as of december   by period in millions total less than year years years more than years principal payments on long term debt interest on long term debt capital commitments pipeline capacity agreements operating lease commitments total includes our senior unsecured notes  having maturity dates from to  million of loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility  having a maturity date of april  and million of loans outstanding under our term loan  having a maturity date of october  interest obligations represent interest due on our senior unsecured notes at fixed rates 
future interest obligations under our revolving credit facility are uncertain  due to the variable interest rate and fluctuating balances 
based on a weighted average interest rate and an unused commitment fee of as of december   million  million and million would be due in less than one year  years and years 
interest obligations under the term loan are also subject to variable interest rates 
based on a weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the term loan as of december   million  million and million would be due in less than one year  years and years 
capital commitments represent binding commitments under purchase orders for materials ordered but not received and firm commitments under binding construction service agreements existing at december  the amounts shown are associated with pipeline capacity agreements on third party pipelines that allow our operating subsidiaries to transport gas to off system markets on behalf of our customers 
pursuant to the settlement of the texas gas rate case in  we are required to annually fund an amount to the texas gas pension plan equal to the amount of actuarially determined net periodic pension cost  including a minimum of million 
in  we expect to fund approximately million to the texas gas pension plan 
distributions for the years ended december   and  we paid distributions of million  million and million to our partners 
note in item of this report contains further discussion regarding our distributions 
changes in cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period  primarily due to an million increase in net income and timing of cash flows associated with our receivables and payables 
changes in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period 
the increase was primarily driven by an million increase in capital expenditures and a million increase in cash used for acquisitions  partially offset by a million decrease in proceeds from the sale of operating assets  insurance reimbursements and other recoveries 
changes in cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was a result of net proceeds of million received from the issuance and sale of equity  including related general partner contributions  and an increase in net long term debt borrowings of million including borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was partly offset by net payments of million to purchase the remaining equity ownership interests in hp storage and louisiana midstream and a million increase in distributions to our partners 
impact of inflation the cumulative impact of inflation over a number of years has resulted in increased costs for current replacement of productive facilities 
the majority of our property  plant and equipment is subject to rate making treatment  and under current ferc practices  recovery is limited to historical costs 
amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable unless a rate case is filed 
however  cost based regulation  along with competition and other market factors  may limit our ability to price jurisdictional services to ensure recovery of inflation s effect on costs 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no guarantees of off balance sheet debt to third parties  no debt obligations that contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligations in the event of specified levels of declines in credit ratings  and no other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting estimates and policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we review our estimates and judgments on a regular  ongoing basis 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
the following accounting policies and estimates are considered critical due to the potentially material impact that the estimates  judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies might have on our reported financial information 
regulation most of our natural gas pipeline subsidiaries are regulated by ferc 
pursuant to ferc regulations certain revenues that we collect may be subject to possible refunds to our customers 
accordingly  during an open rate case  estimates of rate refund reserves are recorded based on regulatory proceedings  advice of counsel and estimated risk adjusted total exposure  as well as other factors 
at december  and  there were no liabilities for any open rate case recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
currently  none of our regulated companies are involved in an open general rate case 
when certain criteria are met  gaap requires that certain rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates regulatory accounting 
this basis of accounting is applicable to operations of our texas gas subsidiary which records certain costs and benefits as regulatory assets and liabilities in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future periods  but is not applicable to operations associated with the fayetteville and greenville laterals due to rates charged under negotiated rate agreements and a portion of the storage capacity due to the regulatory treatment associated with the rates charged for that capacity 
regulatory accounting is not applicable to our other ferc regulated entities 
we monitor the regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate to determine that any regulatory assets continue to be probable of recovery 
if we were to determine that all or a portion of our regulatory assets no longer met the criteria for recognition as regulatory assets  that portion which was not recoverable would be written off  net of any regulatory liabilities 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our regulatory assets and liabilities 
in the course of providing transportation and storage services to customers  the natural gas pipelines may receive different quantities of gas from shippers and operators than the quantities delivered by the pipelines on behalf of those shippers and operators 
this results in transportation and exchange gas receivables and payables  commonly known as imbalances  which are primarily settled in cash or the receipt or delivery of gas in the future 
settlement of natural gas imbalances requires agreement between the pipelines and shippers or operators as to allocations of volumes to specific transportation contracts and timing of delivery of gas based on operational conditions 
the receivables and payables are valued at market price for operations where regulatory accounting is not applicable and are valued at the historical value of gas in storage for operations where regulatory accounting is applicable  consistent with the regulatory treatment 
fair value measurements fair value refers to an exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal market in which the reporting entity transacts based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming its highest and best use 
a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions giving priority  from highest to lowest  to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level  observable inputs not included in level  for example  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities level  and unobservable data level  for example  a reporting entity s own internal data based on the best information available in the circumstances 
we use fair value measurements to record our derivatives  asset retirement obligations and impairments 
we also use fair value measurements to perform our goodwill impairment testing and report fair values for certain items in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
notes and contain more information regarding our fair value measurements 
environmental liabilities our environmental liabilities are based on management s best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation for probable costs associated with environmental assessment and remediation of our operating sites 
these estimates are based on evaluations and discussions with counsel and operating personnel and the current facts and circumstances related to these environmental matters 
at december   we had accrued approximately million for environmental matters 
our environmental accrued liabilities could change substantially in the future due to factors such as the nature and extent of any contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  and the involvement of and direction taken by the epa  ferc and other governmental authorities on these matters 
we continue to conduct environmental assessments and are implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the estimated environmental costs 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our environmental liabilities 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets we evaluate whether the carrying amounts of our long lived and intangible assets have been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of those assets may not be recoverable 
this evaluation is based on undiscounted cash flow projections expected over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted sum of cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding impairments we have recognized 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently when events occur and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in  we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units from december to november the change is preferable because it better aligns our goodwill impairment testing procedures with our planning process and alleviates resource constraints in connection with our year end closing and financial reporting process 
due to significant judgments and estimates that are utilized in a goodwill impairment analysis  we determined it was impracticable to objectively determine operating and valuation estimates as of each november for periods prior to november  as a result  we prospectively applied the change in the annual impairment test date from november  the change in accounting principle does not delay  accelerate  or avoid an impairment charge 
accounting requirements provide that a reporting entity may perform an optional qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  or the optional qualitative assessment is not performed  a quantitative analysis is performed under a two step impairment test to measure whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if based upon a quantitative analysis the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill  the reporting entity must perform an analysis of the fair value of all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined to be less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units as of november  the fair value measurement of the reporting units was derived based on judgments and assumptions we believe market participants would use in pricing the reporting unit 
these judgments and assumptions included the valuation premise  use of a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value and inputs to the valuation model 
the inputs included our five year financial plan operating results  the long term outlook for growth in natural gas demand in the us and measures of the risk free rate  equity premium and systematic risk used in the calculation of the applied discount rate under the capital asset pricing model 
based upon the results of our goodwill impairment testing  no impairment charge related to goodwill was recorded during   or the use of alternate judgments and assumptions could substantially change the results of our goodwill impairment analysis  potentially resulting in the recognition of an impairment charge in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
defined benefit plans we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on our pension and postretirement benefit costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors in the us such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies  as well as our policies regarding management of the plans such as the allocation of plan assets among investment options 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on obligations and related expense associated with these plans 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilize current market information and liability information provided by our plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the merrill lynch aa corporate bond index is consistently used as the basis for the change in discount rate from the last measurement date with this measure confirmed by the yield on other broad bond indices 
additionally  we supplement our discount rate decision with a yield curve analysis 
the yield curve is applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans 
the yield curve is developed by the plans actuaries and is a hypothetical aa aa yield curve represented by a series of annualized discount rates reflecting bond issues having a rating of aa or better by moody investors service  inc or a rating of aa or better by standard poor

forward looking statements investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this report  as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements made by our officials and our subsidiaries during presentations about us  are forward looking 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may project  indicate or imply future results  events  performance or achievements  and may contain the words expect  intend  plan  anticipate  estimate  believe  will likely result  and similar expressions 
in addition  any statement made by our management concerning future financial performance including future revenues  earnings or growth rates  ongoing business strategies or prospects  and possible actions by our partnership or our subsidiaries  are also forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and their potential impact on us 
while management believes that these forward looking statements are reasonable as and when made  there is no assurance that future events affecting us will be those that we anticipate 
all forward looking statements are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected 
these risks and uncertainties include  among others our ability to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts and to sell short term capacity on our pipelines  the costs of maintaining and ensuring the integrity and reliability of our pipeline systems  the impact of new pipelines or new gas supply sources on competition and basis spreads on our pipeline systems  the impact of changes to laws and regulations  such as the proposed greenhouse gas legislation and other changes in environmental regulations  the recently enacted pipeline safety bill  and regulatory changes that result from that legislation applicable to interstate pipelines  on our business  including our costs  liabilities and revenues  the timing  cost  scope and financial performance of our recent  current and future growth projects  the expansion into new product lines and geographic areas  volatility or disruptions in the capital or financial markets  the impact of ferc s rate making policies and actions on the services we offer and the rates we charge and our ability to recover the full cost of operating our pipelines  including earning a reasonable return  operational hazards  litigation and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not have adequate or appropriate insurance coverage  the future cost of insuring our assets  our ability to access new sources of natural gas and the impact on us of any future decreases in supplies of natural gas in our supply areas  the consummation of contemplated transactions and agreements  and the impact on our system throughput and revenues from changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas  including as a result of commodity price changes 
developments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update these statements to reflect any change in our expectations or beliefs or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk with the exception of our revolving credit facility and our term loan  for which the interest rates are periodically reset  our debt has been issued at fixed rates 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the debt instruments but do not directly affect earnings or cash flows 
the following table presents market risk associated with our fixed rate long term debt at december in millions  except interest rates carrying amount of fixed rate debt fair value of fixed rate debt basis point increase in interest rates and resulting debt decrease basis point decrease in interest rates and resulting debt increase weighted average interest rate at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 
a increase in interest rates would increase our cash payments for interest on our variable rate debt by million on an annualized basis 
at december   we had million outstanding under variable rate agreements at a weighted average interest rate of 
approximately half of our debt  including our revolving credit facility  will mature over the next five years 
we expect to refinance the debt either prior to or at maturity 
our ability to refinance the debt at interest rates that are currently available is subject to risk at the magnitude illustrated in the table above 
we expect to refinance the remainder of our debt that will mature based on our assessment of the term rates of interest available in the market 
at december  and  million and million of our undistributed cash  shown on the balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents  was primarily invested in treasury fund accounts 
due to the short term nature of the treasury fund accounts  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
commodity risk our pipelines do not take title to the natural gas and ngls which they transport and store  therefore they do not assume the related commodity price risk associated with the products 
however  certain volumes of our gas stored underground are available for sale and subject to commodity price risk 
at december  and  approximately million and million of gas stored underground  which we own and carry as current gas stored underground  was available for sale and exposed to commodity price risk 
we manage our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of futures  swaps and option contracts 
note of item contains additional information regarding our derivative contracts 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time our existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to renewal or marketing 
we actively monitor future expiration dates associated with our contract portfolio 
the revenue we will be able to earn from renewals of expiring contracts will be influenced by the price differential between physical locations on our pipeline systems basis spreads and other factors discussed below 
we compete with numerous interstate and intrastate pipelines 
our ability to market available natural gas transportation capacity is impacted by supply and demand for natural gas  competition from other pipelines  natural gas price volatility  basis spreads  economic conditions and other factors 
over the past several years  new sources of natural gas have been identified throughout the us and new pipeline infrastructure has been developed which has led to changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins  pooling points and market areas and an overall weakening of basis spreads across our pipeline systems 
we do not expect basis spreads to improve in the near future 
as of december   a substantial portion of our transportation capacity was contracted for under firm transportation agreements having a weighted average remaining life of approximately years 
however  each year a portion of our firm transportation agreements expire and must be renewed or replaced 
we renewed or replaced contracts for most of the firm transportation capacity that expired in  though on average at lower rates 
the amount of contracted transportation capacity which will expire in is greater than in recent years 
in light of the market conditions discussed above  we expect that transportation contracts we renew or enter into in will be at lower rates than our expiring contracts 
remaining available capacity will be marketed and sold on a short term firm or interruptible basis  which will also be at lower rates  based on current market conditions 
we expect that these circumstances will negatively affect our transportation revenues  ebitda and distributable cash flows in the principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity  rates  terms of service  access to gas supplies  flexibility and reliability of service 
in many cases  the elements of competition  in particular flexibility  terms of service and reliability  are key differentiating factors between competitors 
this is especially the case with capacity being sold on a longer term basis 
we are focused on finding opportunities to enhance our competitive profile in these areas by increasing the flexibility of our pipeline systems to meet the demands of customers such as power generators and industrial users  and are continually reviewing our services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options 
credit risk our credit exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by us to them  generally under pal and no notice services 
natural gas price volatility can materially increase credit risk related to gas loaned to customers 
if any significant customer of ours should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas they owe to us  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately trillion british thermal units tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per million british thermal units mmbtu  the market value of that gas was approximately million 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per mmbtu  the market value of this gas at december   would have been approximately million 
as of december   the amount of ngls owed to the operating subsidiaries due to imbalances was approximately mmbbls  which had a market value of approximately million 
although nearly all of our customers pay for our services on a timely basis  we actively monitor the credit exposure to our customers 
we include in our ongoing assessments amounts due pursuant to services we render plus the value of any gas we have lent to a customer through no notice or pal services and the value of gas due to us under a transportation imbalance 
our natural gas pipeline tariffs contain language that allow us to require a customer that does not meet certain credit criteria to provide cash collateral  post a letter of credit or provide a guarantee from a credit worthy entity in an amount equaling up to three months of capacity reservation charges 
for certain agreements  we have included contractual provisions that require additional credit support should the credit ratings of those customers fall below investment grade
