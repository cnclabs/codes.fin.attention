factors affecting brand recognition are often outside the company s control  and the company s efforts to create or enhance favorable brand recognition  such as making significant investments in marketing and advertising campaigns  product design and anticipation of fashion trends  may not have their desired effects 
additionally  the company relies on its licensors to maintain favorable brand recognition of their respective brands  and the company often has no control over the brand management efforts of its licensors 
finally  although the company s independent distributors are subject to contractual requirements to protect the company s brands  it may be difficult to monitor or enforce such requirements  particularly in foreign jurisdictions 
any decline in perceived favorable recognition of the company s owned or licensed brands could materially and adversely affect future results of operations and profitability 
if the company is unable to respond to changes in consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner  sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
fashion trends and consumer demands and tastes often shift quickly 
the company attempts to monitor these trends in order to adapt its product offerings to suit customer demand 
there is a risk that the company will not properly perceive changes in trends or tastes  which may result in the failure to adapt the company s products accordingly 
in addition  new model designs are regularly introduced into the market for all brands to keep ahead of evolving fashion trends as well as to initiate new trends of their own 
there is risk that the public may not favor these new models or that the models may not be ready for sale until after the trend has passed 
if the company fails to respond to and keep up to date with fashion trends and consumer demands and tastes  its brand image  sales  profitability and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents if the company misjudges the demand for its products  high inventory levels could adversely affect future operating results and profitability 
consumer demand for the company s products can affect inventory levels 
if consumer demand is lower than expected  inventory levels can rise causing a strain on operating cash flow 
if the inventory cannot be sold through the company s wholesale or retail outlets  additional write downs or write offs to future earnings could be necessary 
conversely  if consumer demand is higher than expected  insufficient inventory levels could result in unfulfilled customer orders  loss of revenue and an unfavorable impact on customer relationships 
in particular  volatility and uncertainty related to macro economic factors make it more difficult for the company to forecast customer demand in its various markets 
failure to properly judge consumer demand and properly manage inventory could have a material adverse effect on profitability and liquidity 
an increase in product returns could negatively impact the company s operating results and profitability 
the company recognizes revenue as sales when merchandise is shipped and title transfers to the customer 
the company permits the return of damaged or defective products and accepts limited amounts of product returns in certain instances 
accordingly  the company provides allowances for the estimated amounts of these returns at the time of revenue recognition based on historical experience 
while such returns have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past 
any significant increase in damaged or defective products or expected returns could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
the company s business relies on the use of independent parties to manufacture its products 
any loss of an independent manufacturer  or the company s inability to deliver quality goods in a timely manner  could have an adverse effect on customer relations  brand image  net sales and results of operations 
the company employs a flexible manufacturing model that relies on independent manufacturers to meet shifts in marketplace demand 
most of these manufacturers rely on third party suppliers for the various component parts needed to assemble finished watches sold to the company 
all such independent manufacturers and suppliers must achieve and maintain the company s high quality standards and specifications 
the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet the company s high quality standards and specifications could cause the company to miss committed delivery dates with customers  which could result in cancellation of the customers orders 
in addition  delays in delivery of satisfactory products could have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability  particularly if the delays cause the company to be unable to market certain products during the seasonal periods when its sales are typically higher 
see risk factors the company s business is seasonal  with sales traditionally greater during certain holiday seasons  so events and circumstances that adversely affect holiday consumer spending will have a disproportionately adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
a majority of the swiss watch movements used in the manufacture of movado  ebel  concord and esq watches are purchased from two suppliers  one of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the company s competitors 
additionally  the company generally does not have long term supply commitments with its manufacturers and thus competes for production facilities with other organizations  some of which are larger and have greater resources 
any loss of an independent manufacturer or disruption in the supply chain with respect to critical component parts may 
table of contents result in the company s inability to deliver quality goods in a timely manner and could have an adverse effect on customer relations  brand image  net sales and results of operations 
if the company loses any of its license agreements  there may be significant loss of revenues and a negative effect on business 
the company has the right to produce  market and distribute watches under the brand names of esq  coach  tommy hilfiger  hugo boss  juicy couture  scuderia ferrari and lacoste pursuant to license agreements with the respective owners of those trademarks 
there are certain minimum royalty payments as well as other requirements associated with these agreements 
failure to meet any of these requirements could result in the loss of the license 
additionally  after the term of any license agreement has concluded  the licensor may decide not to renew with the company 
for the fiscal year ended january   the above mentioned licensed brands represented approximately of the company s net sales 
no individual licensed brand represented net sales greater than of the company s total consolidated net sales 
the loss of one or more of the company s licenses could result in loss of future revenues which could adversely affect its financial condition 
changes in the sales or channel mix of the company s products could impact gross profit margins 
the individual brands that are sold by the company are sold at a wide range of price points and yield a variety of gross profit margins 
in addition  sales of excess and or discontinued inventory into the liquidation channel generate a lower gross profit margin than non liquidation sales 
thus  the mix of sales by brand as well as by distribution channel can have an impact on the gross profit margins of the company 
if the company s sales mix shifts unfavorably toward brands with lower gross profit margins than the company s historical consolidated gross profit margin or if a greater proportion of liquidation sales are made  it could have an adverse effect on the results of operations 
the company s business is seasonal  with sales traditionally greater during certain holiday seasons  so events and circumstances that adversely affect holiday consumer spending will have a disproportionately adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s sales are seasonal by nature 
the company s us sales are traditionally greater during the christmas and holiday season 
internationally  major selling seasons center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring 
the amount of net sales and operating income generated during these seasons depends upon the general level of retail sales at such times  as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
the second half of each year accounted for   and of the company s net sales for the fiscal years ended january    and  respectively 
if events or circumstances were to occur that negatively impact consumer spending during such holiday seasons  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales  profitability and results of operations 
sales in the company s retail stores are dependent upon customer foot traffic 
the success of the company s retail stores is  to a certain extent  dependent upon the amount of customer foot traffic generated by the outlet center in which those stores are located 
most of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations 

table of contents factors that can affect customer foot traffic include decline in customer discretionary spending  the location of the outlet center  the location of the company s store within the outlet center  the other tenants in the outlet center  the occupancy rate of the outlet center  the success of the outlet center and tenant advertising to attract customers  increased competition in areas surrounding the outlet center  and increased competition from shopping over the internet and other alternatives such as mail order 
additionally  since most of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations  factors that affect travel could decrease outlet center traffic 
such factors include the price and supply of fuel  travel concerns and restrictions  international instability  terrorism and inclement weather 
a reduction in foot traffic in relevant shopping centers could have a material adverse effect on retail sales and profitability 
if the company is unable to maintain existing space or to lease new space for its retail stores in prime outlet center locations or is unable to complete construction on a timely basis  the company s ability to achieve favorable results in its retail business could be adversely affected 
the company s outlet stores are strategically located in top outlet centers in the united states  most of which are located near vacation destinations 
if the company cannot maintain and secure locations in prime outlet centers for its outlet stores  it could jeopardize the operations of the stores and business plans for the future 
additionally  if the company cannot complete construction in new stores within the planned timeframes  cost overruns and lost revenue could adversely affect the profitability of the retail segment 
the company on average plans for two to three new stores or renovations per fiscal year 
the average time required to build out or renovate each store and open it after delivery of possession is generally less than days 
current or future cost reduction  streamlining  restructuring or business optimization initiatives could result in the company incurring various one time  non recurring or unusual charges and other items  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported earnings per share and other unadjusted financial measures 
in the course of the company s efforts to implement its business plan to adapt to the changing economic environment  the company may be required to take actions that could result in the incurrence of various one time  non recurring or unusual charges and other items 
these charges and other items may include severance and relocation expenses  write offs or write downs of assets  impairment charges  facilities closure costs or other business optimization costs 
in general  these costs will reduce the company s operating income and net income along with the associated unadjusted per share measures 
therefore  such charges and other items could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported results of operations and the market price of the company s securities 

table of contents if the company is unable to successfully implement its growth strategies  its future operating results could suffer 
there are certain risks involved in the company seeking to expand its business through acquisitions  license agreements  joint ventures and other initiatives 
there is risk involved with each of these 
acquisitions and new license agreements require the company to ensure that new brands will successfully complement the other brands in its portfolio 
the company assumes the risk that the new brand will not be viewed by the public as favorably as its other brands 
in addition  the integration of an acquired company or licensed brand into the company s existing business can strain the company s current infrastructure with the additional work required and there can be no assurance that the integration of acquisitions or licensed brands will be successful or that acquisitions or licensed brands will generate sales increases 
the company needs to ensure it has the adequate human resources and systems in place to allow for successful assimilation of new businesses 
the inability to successfully implement its growth strategies could adversely affect the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the loss or infringement of the company s trademarks or other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
the company believes that its trademarks and other intellectual property rights are vital to the competitiveness and success of its business and therefore it takes all appropriate actions to register and protect them 
such actions may not be adequate to prevent imitation of the company s products or infringement of its intellectual property rights  or to assure that others will not challenge the company s rights  or that such rights will be successfully defended 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries  including some in which the company sells its products  may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  which could make it more difficult to successfully defend such challenges to them 
the company s inability to obtain or maintain rights in its trademarks  including its licensed marks  could have an adverse effect on brand image and future results of operations 
fluctuations in the pricing of commodities or the cost of labor could adversely affect the company s ability to produce products at favorable prices 
some of the company s higher end watch offerings are made with materials such as diamonds  precious metals and gold 
the company relies on independent contractors to manufacture and assemble the majority of its watch brands 
a significant change in the prices of these commodities or the cost of third party labor could adversely affect the company s business by reducing gross profit margins  forcing an increase in suggested retail prices  which could lead to decreasing consumer demand  which could lead to higher inventory levels 
any and all of the above events could adversely affect the company s future cash flow and results of operations 

table of contents the company s business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
a significant portion of the company s inventory purchases are denominated in swiss francs 
the company reduces its exposure to the swiss franc exchange rate risk through a hedging program 
under the hedging program  the company manages most of its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows it to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets 
in the event these exposures do not offset  the company has the ability under a hedging program to utilize forward exchange contracts and purchased foreign currency options to mitigate foreign currency risk 
if these hedge instruments are unsuccessful at minimizing the risk or are deemed ineffective  any fluctuation of the swiss franc exchange rate could impact the future results of operations 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect relative prices at which the company and its foreign competitors sell products in the same market 
additionally  a portion of the company s net sales are recorded in its foreign subsidiaries in a currency other than the local currency of that subsidiary 
this predominantly occurs in the company s hong kong and swiss subsidiaries when they sell to euro and british pound based customers 
this exposure is not hedged by the company 
any fluctuation in the euro and british pound exchange rate in relation to the hong kong dollar and swiss franc would have an effect on these sales that are recorded in euro and british pound 
the currency effect on these sales has an equal effect on their recorded gross profit since the costs of these sales are recorded in the entities respective local currency 
as a result of these and other foreign currency sales  certain of the company s subsidiaries have outstanding foreign currency receivables 
at times  the company reduces its exposure to this exchange rate risk  partially  under the hedging program utilizing forward exchange contracts 
furthermore  since the company s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars  revenues  income and expenses  as well as assets and liabilities of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries must be translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the company s reported revenues  earnings  financial position and the comparability of results of operations from period to period 
the grinberg family owns a majority of the voting power of the company s stock 
each share of common stock of the company is entitled to one vote per share while each share of class a common stock of the company is entitled to ten votes per share 
while the members of the grinberg family do not own a majority of the company s outstanding common stock  by their significant holdings of class a common stock they control a majority of the voting power represented by all outstanding shares of both classes of stock 
consequently  the grinberg family is in a position to significantly influence any matters that are brought to a vote of the shareholders including  but not limited to  the election of the board of directors and any action requiring the approval of shareholders  including any amendments to the company s certificate of incorporation  mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
this concentration of ownership also may delay  defer or even prevent a change in control of the company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the grinberg family 
these transactions might include proxy contests  tender offers  mergers or other purchases of common stock that could give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for shares of the company s common stock 

table of contents the company s stock price could fluctuate and possibly decline due to changes in revenue  operating results and cash flow 
the company s revenue  results of operations and cash flow can be affected by several factors  some of which are not within its control 
those factors include  but are not limited to  those described as risk factors in this item a and under forward looking statements on page any or all of these factors could cause a decline in revenues or increased expenses  both of which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations 
if the company s earnings failed to meet the expectations of the public in any given period  the company s stock price could fluctuate and possibly decline 
if the company were to lose its relationship with any of its key customers or distributors or any of such customers or distributors were to experience financial difficulties or go out of business  there may be a significant loss of revenue and operating results 
the company s customer base covers a wide range of distribution including national jewelry store chains  department stores  independent regional jewelers  licensors retail stores and a network of independent distributors in many countries throughout the world 
except for its agreements with independent distributors  the company does not have long term sales contracts with its customers  nor does it have a significant backlog of unfilled orders 
customer purchasing decisions could vary with each selling season 
a material change in the company s customers purchasing decisions could have an adverse effect on its revenue and operating results 
the company extends credit to its customers based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition usually without requiring collateral 
should any of the company s larger customers experience financial difficulties  it could result in the company s curtailing of doing business with them  an increased rate of product returns or an increase in its exposure related to its accounts receivable 
the inability to collect on these receivables could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results and cash flows 
the inability or difficulty of the company s customers  suppliers and business partners to obtain credit  could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and liquidity 
many of the company s customers  suppliers and business partners rely on a stable  liquid and well functioning financial system to fund their operations and a disruption in their ability to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions to or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to the company  including delivering product ordered by the company and placing or paying for future orders of the company s products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and liquidity 
the company s wholesale business could be negatively affected by further changes of ownership  contraction and consolidation in the retail industry 
a large portion of the company s us wholesale business is based on sales to major jewelry store chains and department stores 
in recent years  the retail industry has experienced changes in ownership  contraction and consolidations  with a number of jewelry chain stores and department store operators going out of business and liquidating their inventory 
future reorganizations  changes of ownership and consolidations could further reduce the number of retail doors in which the company s products are sold 
table of contents and increase the concentration of sales among fewer national or large regional retailers  which could materially adversely affect the company s wholesale business 
if the company were to lose key members of management or be unable to attract and retain the talent required for the business  operating results could suffer 
the company s ability to execute key operating initiatives as well as to deliver product and marketing concepts appealing to target consumers depends largely on the efforts and abilities of key executives and senior management s competencies 
the unexpected loss of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the future business 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain the talent and skills needed in the future 
if the company cannot secure financing and credit on favorable terms  the company s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
credit and equity markets remain sensitive to world events and macro economic developments 
therefore  the company s cost of borrowing may increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for the company s operations or to refinance long term obligations as they become payable 
in addition  the company s borrowing costs can be affected by independent rating agencies short and long term debt ratings which are based largely on the company s performance as measured by credit metrics including interest coverage and leverage ratios 
a decrease in these ratings would likely also increase the company s cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for it to obtain financing 
a significant increase in the costs the company incurs in order to finance its operations may have a material adverse impact on its business results and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted outside of the united states 
many factors affecting business activities outside the united states could adversely impact this business 
the company produces all of its watches in europe and asia 
the company also generates approximately of its revenue from international sources 
factors that could affect this business activity vary by region and market and generally include without limitation instability or changes in social  political and or economic conditions that could disrupt the trade activity in the countries where the company s manufacturers  suppliers and customers are located  the imposition of additional duties  taxes and other charges on imports and exports  changes in foreign laws and regulations  the adoption or expansion of trade sanctions  recessions in foreign economies  and a significant change in currency valuation in specific countries or markets 

table of contents if the company was unable to protect the security of personal information about its customers or employees or prevent a privacy breach  it could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and suffer significant negative publicity which could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
as part of the normal course of business the company is involved in the receipt and storage of electronic information about customers and employees  as well as proprietary financial and non financial data 
although the company believes it has taken reasonable and appropriate actions to protect the security of this information  if the company were to experience a security breach  acts of vandalism  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors or other similar events  it could result in government enforcement actions and private litigation  attract a substantial amount of media attention  and damage the company s reputation and its relationships with its customers and employees  materially adversely affecting the company s sales and results of operations

the company s net sales historically have been higher during the second half of the fiscal year 
the second half of each year accounted for   and of the company s net sales for the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
the company s retail operations consist of outlet stores located throughout the united states and  until february   also included the movado brand flagship store located at rockefeller center in new york city which was closed on that date  as the company did not renew its lease 
the significant factors that influence annual sales volumes in the company s retail operations are similar to those that influence us wholesale sales 
in addition  most of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations and  therefore  the seasonality of these stores is driven by the peak tourist seasons associated with these locations 

table of contents gross margins 
the company s overall gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors brand and product sales mix  product pricing strategy  manufacturing costs and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  in particular the relationship between the us dollar and the swiss franc and the euro 
gross margins for the company may not be comparable to those of other companies  since some companies include all the costs related to their distribution networks in cost of sales whereas the company does not include the costs associated with its us and asia warehousing and distribution facilities nor the occupancy costs for the retail segment in the cost of sales line item 
gross margins vary among the brands included in the company s portfolio and also among watch models within each brand 
watches in the luxury category generally earn lower gross margin percentages than watches in the accessible luxury category 
gross margins in the company s outlet business have historically been lower than those in the wholesale business since the outlets primarily sell seconds and discontinued models that generally command lower selling prices 
in the current fiscal year  gross margins for the outlet business were in line with that of the wholesale business as the segment was less promotional year over year 
all of the company s brands compete with a number of other brands on the basis of not only styling but also wholesale and retail price 
the company s ability to improve margins through price increases is therefore  to some extent  constrained by competitors actions 
cost of sales of the company s products consists primarily of component costs  royalties  assembly costs  depreciation  amortization and unit overhead costs associated with the company s supply chain operations in switzerland and asia 
the company s supply chain operations consist of logistics management of assembly operations and product sourcing in switzerland and asia and minor assembly in switzerland 
through productivity improvement efforts  the company has controlled the level of overhead costs and maintained flexibility in its cost structure by outsourcing a significant portion of its component and assembly requirements 
cost of sales of the company s products includes costs for raw material and components  as well as labor for assembly of finished goods  all of which can be impacted by inflation 
while inflation in costs has negatively impacted gross margin percentage  this effect has not been material to the company s results of operations for the periods presented in this report 
a significant increase in these costs due to inflation could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
while the company may seek to offset the negative inflationary impact on these costs with price increases on its products  its ability to effectively do so will depend on the extent it can pass on price increases and still remain competitive in the marketplace 
effective february   the company changed its method of valuing its us inventories to the average cost method 
in prior years  primarily all us inventories were valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
with this change  all of the company s inventories are now valued using the average cost method 
the comparative consolidated financial statements of prior periods presented have been adjusted to apply the accounting method retroactively

since a substantial amount of the company s product costs are incurred in swiss francs  fluctuations in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate can impact the company s cost of goods sold and  therefore  its gross margins 
the company reduces its exposure to the swiss franc exchange rate risk through a hedging program 
under the hedging program  the company manages most of its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows it to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets 
in the event these exposures do not offset  the company has the ability to hedge its swiss franc purchases using a combination of forward contracts and purchased currency options 
the company s hedging program had the effect of reducing the exchange rate impact on product costs and gross margins for fiscal years  and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
the company s sg a expenses consist primarily of marketing  selling  distribution  general and administrative expenses 
in fiscal and  the company recorded a million pre tax charge related to donations made to the movado group foundation

in fiscal  the company also recorded a benefit of million resulting from the reversal of a previously recorded liability for a retirement agreement with the company s former chairman 
annual marketing expenditures are based principally on overall strategic considerations relative to maintaining or increasing market share in markets that management considers to be crucial to the company s continued success as well as on general economic conditions in the various markets around the world in which the company sells its products 
marketing expenses include various forms of media advertising  digital advertising and co operative advertising with customers and distributors and other point of sale marketing and promotion spending 
for fiscal  and  the company increased its investment in marketing and advertising in order to elevate its connection to consumers and better position its brands in the marketplace 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  sales force travel and related expenses  depreciation and amortization  expenses associated with baselworld  the annual watch and jewelry trade show  and other industry trade shows and operating costs incurred in connection with the company s retail business 
sales commissions vary with overall sales levels 
retail selling expenses consist primarily of payroll related and store occupancy costs 
distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries of distribution staff  rental and other occupancy costs  security  depreciation and amortization of furniture and leasehold improvements and shipping supplies 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee compensation including performance based compensation  employee benefit plan costs  office rent  management information systems costs  professional fees  bad debts  depreciation and amortization of furniture  computer software and leasehold improvements  patent and trademark expenses and various other general corporate expenses 
interest expense 
to the extent it borrows  the company will record interest expense on its revolving credit facility 
additionally  interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the company s revolving credit facility 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and those significant policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and the application of certain critical accounting policies require management to make judgments based on estimates and assumptions that affect the information reported 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to sales discounts and markdowns  product returns  bad debt  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  impairments  stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources on historical experience  contractual commitments and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in the wholesale segment  the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss in accordance with its fob shipping point terms of sale and after the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the retail segment  transfer of title and risk of loss occurs at the time of register receipt 
the company records estimates for sales returns and sales and cash discount allowances as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the sales are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis  customer agreements and or currently known factors that arise in the normal course of business 
while returns have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past 
in the event that returns are authorized at a rate significantly higher than the company s historic rate  the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on its operating results for the period in which such results materialize 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million related to the repositioning of the coach watch brand from a collection priced to be sold in a department store s fine watch department to one suitable for sale in the fashion watch department 
the charge represents the company s estimated cost of the aggregate sales allowance to coach watch retailers affected by the repositioning 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable  assessments of collectability based on historic trends  the financial condition of the company s customers and an evaluation of economic conditions 
in general  the actual bad debt losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the allowances it established 
as of january   except for those accounts provided for in the reserve for doubtful accounts  the company knew of no situations with any of the company s major customers which would indicate the customer s inability to make their required payments 

table of contents inventories the company valued its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
effective february   the company changed its method of valuing its us inventories to the average cost method 
in prior years  primarily all us inventories were valued using the fifo method 
with this change  all of the company s inventories are now valued using the average cost method 
the company believed that the average cost method of inventory valuation is preferable because it permits the company to use a single method of accounting for all of the company s us and international inventories  it aligns costing with the company s forecasting and procurement decisions  and since a number of the company s key competitors use the average cost method  it improves comparability of the company s financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements of prior periods presented have been adjusted to apply the accounting method retroactively  as described in the applicable accounting guidance for accounting changes and error corrections 
the company performed reviews of its on hand inventory to determine amounts  if any  of inventory that is deemed discontinued  excess  or unsaleable 
inventory classified as discontinued  together with the related component parts which can be assembled into saleable finished goods  is sold primarily through the company s outlet stores 
when management determines that finished product is unsaleable or that it is impractical to build the remaining components into watches for sale  a charge is recorded to value those products and components at the lower of cost or market 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a net pre tax profit of million related to the sale of certain ebel proprietary watch movements that were previously written down in the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  there were events and circumstances  as described below  that resulted in the company recording a non cash charge of approximately million to write down certain inventories to market value  primarily inventories of certain non core gold watches and related parts and mechanical movements 
certain watches in the ebel brand line used proprietary watch movements that were assembled by the company from parts purchased from third party suppliers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed a strategic review of the ebel brand and concluded that the future direction for the brand would not include the production of these proprietary movements  making inventory of these movement parts excess and obsolete 
as a result  the company recorded a charge to cost of sales for the future disposition of such inventory  net of estimated recovery 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company concluded it would significantly reduce its offering of gold watches  considering particularly the recent increases in the price of gold  and therefore recorded a charge to cost of sales related to non core gold inventory 
ordinarily  the company would utilize its outlet stores to dispose of this excess inventory  however  in performing a detailed review of the non core inventory  the company concluded that the time  effort and costs to sell most of the gold watches were excessive and that the current salvage value provided a quicker and adequate return 
these gold watches and components were valued at market  which resulted in a charge to cost of sales 
as of january   the company substantially completed its initiative to recover gold from this non core gold inventory 
long lived assets the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its depreciable assets based on factors including historical experience  the expected beneficial service period of the asset  the quality and durability of the asset and the company s maintenance policy including periodic upgrades 
changes in useful lives are made on a prospective basis unless factors indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable and an impairment is necessary 

table of contents the company performs an impairment review of its long lived assets once events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when such a determination has been made  management compares the carrying value of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred  the loss is recognized during that period 
the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value of the long lived assets 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the carrying value of its long lived assets with respect to certain movado boutiques was not recoverable 
the review was performed because of the closing of the boutique division and as a result the company recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to the write downs of property  plant and equipment 
this charge was included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million  primarily related to the write down of certain intangible assets  tooling costs and trade booths for the basel fair 
the review was performed because of fiscal fourth quarter losses and future forecasted losses of specific business areas 
this charge was included in the selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
all of the above impairment charges were calculated as the difference between the assets carrying values and their estimated fair value 
in each case  the estimated fair value of the assets was zero as the future undiscounted cash flow was negative 
warranties all watches sold by the company come with limited warranties covering the movement against defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from two to three years from the date of purchase  with the exception of tommy hilfiger watches  for which the warranty period is ten years 
in addition  the warranty period is five years for the gold plating on certain movado watch cases and bracelets 
the company records an estimate for future warranty costs based on historical repair costs 
warranty costs have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established 
if such costs were to substantially exceed estimates  this could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
stock based compensation under the accounting guidance for share based payments  the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of each option at the grant date which requires that certain assumptions be made 
the expected life of stock option grants is determined using historical data and represents the time period during which the stock option is expected to be outstanding until it is exercised 
the risk free interest rate is the yield on the grant date of us treasury constant maturities with a maturity date closest to the expected life of the stock option 
the expected stock price volatility is derived from historical volatility and calculated based on the estimated term structure of the stock option grant 
the expected dividend yield is calculated using the expected annualized dividend which remains constant during the expected term of the option 
compensation expense for equity instruments is accrued based on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
this estimate is reflected in the period of change 
expense related to stock option compensation is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term 

table of contents income taxes the company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax laws and tax rates in each jurisdiction where the company operates  and applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  the amounts of any future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
the company calculates estimated income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for both book and tax purposes 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 
the company follows guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this guidance also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transitions

table of contents record and payment dates  will be determined  in each quarter  by the board of directors  in its sole discretion 
on march   the board approved a share repurchase program under which the company may purchase up to million of its outstanding common shares from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
the authorization expires on january   and the company may purchase shares of its common stock through open market purchases  block trades or otherwise 
the shares will be purchased primarily to mitigate the dilutive impact of equity grants during the course of the next few years 
therefore  the company does not expect the share repurchase program to have a significant impact on the weighted average of shares outstanding for fiscal coincident with its approval of the share repurchase program on march   the board rescinded a previous share repurchase program authorized in april  under which the company had repurchased a total of  shares of common stock in the open market during the first and second quarters of fiscal at a total cost of approximately million or average per share 
during the twelve months ended january   the company did not repurchase shares of common stock under this program 
at january   the company had working capital of million as compared to million in the prior year

the company has the ability to manage a portion of its capital expenditures on discretionary projects 
management believes that the cash on hand in addition to the expected cash flow from operations and the company s short term borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations includes store operating leases  which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent 
these obligation amounts include future minimum lease payments and exclude direct operating costs 
the company had outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of fiscal for raw materials  finished watches and packaging in the normal course of business 
these purchase obligation amounts do not represent total anticipated purchases but represent only amounts to be paid for items required to be purchased under agreements that are enforceable  legally binding and specify minimum quantity  price and term 
other long term obligations primarily consist of two items minimum commitments related to the company s license agreements and endorsement agreements with brand ambassadors 
the company sources  distributes  advertises and sells 
table of contents watches pursuant to its exclusive license agreements with unaffiliated licensors 
royalty amounts are generally based on a stipulated percentage of revenues  although most of these agreements contain provisions for the payment of minimum annual royalty amounts

unrecognized tax benefits at january  of million and accrued interest and penalties of million both gross of tax benefit are not included above 
the final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations  interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations 
the company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters 
however  the audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the company owing additional taxes 
management anticipates that it is reasonably possible that the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million in the next months due to the potential expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax return examinations  a portion of which may affect the effective tax rate  however  management does not currently anticipate a significant effect on net earnings 
future developments may result in a change in this assessment 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities

for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period  cross reference to other disclosures is required 
as permitted under asu  the company has elected to present reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income within a single note to the financial statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
asu no 
eliminates the current option to disclose other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
as permitted under asu no 
 the company has elected to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure relates to foreign currency exchange risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
a significant portion of the company s purchases are denominated in swiss francs 
the company reduces its exposure to the swiss franc exchange rate risk through a hedging program 
under the hedging program  the company manages most of its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows it to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets 
in the event these exposures do not offset  the company uses various derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposures to currency fluctuations  predominately forward and option contracts 
when entered into  the company designates and documents these derivative instruments as a cash flow hedge of a specific underlying exposure  and sets forth the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and documented as a cash flow hedge  and which are highly effective  are recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings  and then are later reclassified into earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction 
the earnings impact is partially offset by the effects of currency movements on the underlying hedged transactions 
if the company does not engage in a hedging 
table of contents program  any change in the swiss franc to local currency would have an equal effect on the company s cost of sales 
the company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency receivables and liabilities 
these forward contracts are not designated as qualified hedges and  therefore  changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized into earnings  thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency receivables and liabilities 
as of january   the company s entire net forward contracts hedging portfolio consisted of million swiss francs equivalent for various expiry dates ranging through july  compared to a portfolio of million swiss francs equivalent for various expiry dates ranging through july  as of january  if the company were to settle its swiss franc forward contracts at january   the net result would be a gain of million  net of tax expense of million 
the company had no swiss franc option contracts related to cash flow hedges as of january  or january  the company s board of directors authorized the hedging of the company s swiss franc denominated investment in its wholly owned swiss subsidiaries using purchase options under certain limitations 
these hedges are treated as net investment hedges under the relevant accounting guidance regarding derivative instruments 
as of january  and  the company did not hold a purchased option hedge portfolio related to net investment hedging 
commodity risk the company considers its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices to be primarily related to gold used in the manufacturing of the company s watches 
under a hedging program  the company can purchase various commodity derivative instruments  primarily future contracts 
these derivatives are documented as qualified cash flow hedges  and gains and losses on these derivative instruments are first reflected in other comprehensive income  and later reclassified into earnings  partially offset by the effects of gold market price changes on the underlying actual gold purchases 
the company did not hold any futures contracts in its gold hedge portfolio related to cash flow hedges as of january  and  thus any changes in the gold price will have an equal effect on the company s cost of sales 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company concluded it would significantly reduce its offering of gold watches and the company decided to melt its non core inventory of gold watches because the current salvage value of the gold was adequate and could be easily and quickly realized  while significant excessive time  effort and costs would be required to sell the gold watches 
as a result  the company entered into commodity futures contracts to offset its exposure to the fluctuating value of gold 
these futures contracts are not designated as qualified hedges and  therefore  changes in the fair value of these derivatives were recognized into earnings  thereby offsetting the earnings effect of fluctuations in the sale price of gold 
as of january  and  the company held no commodity futures contracts related to gold 
debt and interest rate risk in addition  the company has certain debt obligations with variable interest rates  which are based on libor plus a fixed additional interest rate 
the company does not hedge these interest rate risks 
as of january   the company had no outstanding debt
