overview our business ascena is a leading national specialty retailer of apparel for women  and tween girls and boys  and operates  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  the following principal retail brands justice  lane bryant  maurices  dressbarn  and catherines 
the company s operations include approximately  stores throughout the united states  puerto rico and canada  with annual revenues of over billion for the fiscal year ended july  on june   the company acquired charming shoppes  inc charming shoppes and its related family of retail brands 
charming shoppes owned and operated multiple retail brands through over  retail stores and e commerce operations  including lane bryant  catherines  fashion bug  and figi s

the fashion bug business  which consisted of approximately retail stores  ceased operations in february the liquidation of the related net assets was concluded during the fourth quarter of fiscal and resulted in an immaterial adjustment to goodwill 
in addition  the company also announced  contemporaneously with the closing of the acquisition of charming shoppes  its intent to sell the acquired figi s business  which markets food and specialty gift products 
in august  the company entered into an agreement to sell the principal net assets of the figi s business the figi s sale 
the figi s sale is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal and remains subject to customary closing conditions 
the fashion bug and figi s businesses have been classified as discontinued operations within the accompanying audited financial statements of the company 
we classify our businesses into five segments following a brand oriented approach justice  lane bryant  maurices  dressbarn and catherines 
the justice segment includes approximately specialty retail and outlet stores  e commerce operations  and certain licensed franchises in international territories

the catherines segment includes approximately specialty retail and outlet stores  and e commerce operations 
the catherines brand offers classic apparel and accessories for wear to work and casual lifestyles in a full range of plus sizes  generally catering to the female customer years and older 
our objectives and risks objectives our core strengths include a portfolio of value oriented  lifestyle brands primarily serving the female customer at various levels of maturity and sizes  beginning from age this portfolio of brands is well complemented by a strong and experienced management team  a disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet 
despite the various risks associated with the current global economic environment as further discussed below  we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long term sustainable growth in revenue  net income and operating cash flow 
we continue to focus on a number of ongoing key initiatives aimed at increasing our profitability and integrating newly acquired businesses  including reducing expenses and improving our comparable store sales trends 
these initiatives include  but are not limited to  the following integration of charming shoppes the integration of charming shoppes continued during fiscal  and included an operational and strategic assessment of its businesses and existing cost structure 
among other areas  we developed plans to integrate our respective companies technology platforms  sourcing operations  supply chain operations and e commerce fulfillment operations 
as a result of this assessment  and in connection with the cost saving initiatives discussed below  we identified a number of opportunities to achieve operational efficiencies and streamline corporate overhead 
these actions are expected to be implemented over the next two years 
store expansion we have been exploring  and will continue to explore  expansion opportunities both within our current market areas and in other regions  including international expansion 
during fiscal  we opened a net stores 
this included net openings of stores at justice  net openings of stores at maurices  and was partially offset by net closings of stores at lane bryant  net closings of store at dressbarn and net closings of stores at catherines 
during fiscal  we currently plan to open between net new stores in the aggregate for all our brands 
during fiscal  our justice brand continued to increase its international presence by opening stores in canada  for a total of stores 
in addition  maurices continued to expand in canada during fiscal by opening stores  for a total of stores 
both justice and maurices plan to continue their canadian expansion during fiscal e commerce over the past few years  the company has focused on the continued growth of its e commerce channel across all brands 
total e commerce revenues amounted to approximately million during fiscal after giving effect to the charming shoppes acquisition as of the beginning of fiscal  this represented an increase of approximately over fiscal we continue to develop our e commerce platform and believe this will be an on going source of sales growth in future periods 
cost saving initiatives over the past few years  we have centralized certain of our distribution center operations  our information technology operations  and our payroll processing operations 
in addition  our project to consolidate certain of our financial systems and processes across our legacy family of brands  including a common general ledger and consolidation platform  was completed in fiscal we anticipate adding the operations of charming shoppes onto our technology platform over the next two years 
we expect to continue to leverage our shared resources among our brands  including migrating to more common technology platforms and more centralized supply chain operations  and believe these efforts will continue to lead to increased cost savings and efficiencies in future periods 
risks there are trends and other factors  including those described below  which we face as a women s  and girls and boys  specialty apparel retailer that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations  see part i  item a risk factors of the fiscal k 
general economic conditions 
our performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending 
some of the factors negatively impacting discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions  wages and high unemployment  increased taxation  high consumer debt  reductions in net worth based on severe market declines such as in residential real estate markets  higher fuel  energy and other prices  increasing interest rates  severe weather conditions and low consumer confidence 
in addition  any significant volatility in our financial markets  as has been experienced in the past  could also negatively impact the levels of future discretionary consumer spending 
generally  we experienced lower and inconsistent customer traffic and spending patterns during the better part of fiscal we believe that the lower level of consumer spending during this timeframe was largely related to some of the macroeconomic and other conditions mentioned above  particularly increased taxation  continuing high unemployment and the adverse effects of unseasonably cold weather and storms 
consequently  this contributed to a decline in comparable store sales and lower merchandise margins in our brick and mortar sales channel during this period  which were offset  in part  by continued growth in our e commerce sales channel 
such macroeconomic and other factors could continue to have a negative effect on the lower level of consumer spending in the us  which in turn  could have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
integration of charming shoppes 
the success of the charming shoppes acquisition will depend on our ability to manage our combined operations  to realize opportunities for revenue growth  and to eliminate redundant and excess costs 
achieving the anticipated benefits of integrating charming shoppes may present a number of significant risks and uncertainties 
weather conditions 
weather conditions can affect our net sales because inclement weather may discourage travel or require temporary store closures  thereby reducing customer traffic 
unseasonably warmer weather during typically colder months or unseasonably colder weather during typically warmer months  as was experienced in the spring of fiscal  can also affect the seasonal composition and demand for our merchandise 
price increases 
the raw materials used to manufacture our products  in particular cotton  and our transportation and contract manufacturing labor costs  are subject to availability constraints and price volatility 
over the past couple of years  we had seen an increase in such costs  although cotton prices have since moderated 
in response to these price increases  we have moderately increased merchandise prices on certain items in each of our brands and may  in the future  need to further increase merchandise prices in order to maintain our merchandise margins 
consequently  higher product costs could have a negative effect on our gross profit margin and increased selling prices could have a negative effect on our sales volume 
seasonality of business 
our business is typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of holiday and back to school shopping periods 
in particular  sales at justice tend to be significantly higher during the fall season which occurs during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  as this includes the back to school period and the december holiday season which is focused on gift giving merchandise 
the maurices brand experiences peak sales during the december holiday season as well as during the early spring which includes the easter holiday season 
the dressbarn brand has historically experienced higher sales in the spring  which includes the easter and mother s day holidays 
the lane bryant and catherines brands typically experience peak sales during the easter  mother s day and december holiday seasons 
lane bryant s peak sales around mother s day typically extend through memorial day and into the early summer 
in addition  our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on  among other things  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in merchandise mix 
competition 
the retail apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented  with numerous competitors  including department stores  off price retailers  specialty stores  discount stores  mass merchandisers and internet based retailers  many of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors are able to engage in aggressive promotions  which include reducing their selling prices 
some of our competitors include walmart  macy s  jcpenney  kohl s  old navy  aeropostale and target 
other competitors may move into the markets that we serve  particularly in the plus size women s apparel market where we have a high concentration of sales 
our business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts  and to changes in customer tastes and preferences 
if we fail to compete successfully  we could face lower net sales and may need to offer greater discounts to our customers  which could result in decreased profitability 
we believe that we have established and reinforced our image as a source of fashion and value by focusing on our target customers  and by offering superior customer service and convenience 
customer tastes and fashion trends 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and can change rapidly 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
if we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or trends and misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines  our sales will be lower and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory 
in response  we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
summary of financial performance operating results our operating results for fiscal reflect the inclusion of the charming shoppes acquisition for the entire twelve month period  whereas fiscal only includes such operations for a day period from the acquisition date 
in fiscal  we reported net sales of billion  income from continuing operations of million and net income from continuing operations per diluted share of 
this compares to net sales of billion  income from continuing operations of million and net income from continuing operations per diluted share of in fiscal including a loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  net income was million in fiscal and net income per diluted share was 
this compares to a loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  and net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal the decrease in net income and net income per diluted share during fiscal was primarily due to an overall decline in operating income  which reflected the incurrence of incremental acquisition related  integration and restructuring costs  a duplicative overhead structure and incremental depreciation expense 
also contributing to the overall decrease in net income and net income per diluted share was an increase in interest expense to service the debt incurred to fund the charming shoppes acquisition and a loss on extinguishment of debt 
these decreases were offset in part by a decrease in the provision for income taxes  the absence of million of acquisition related  transaction costs incurred during fiscal and lower losses from discontinued operations 
as discussed earlier under the section entitled general economic conditions  the operating environment for the better part of fiscal has remained challenging 
this  in turn  had a significant impact on our operating results 
nevertheless  our operating performance for fiscal was positively affected by a increase in net sales  consisting of organic growth from our legacy family of brands and growth from the charming shoppes acquisition 
the increase in net sales from our legacy family of brands was driven by both our comparable store sales at justice and new store growth at both our justice and maurices brands  as well as strong growth in e commerce sales at all of our legacy brands 
partially offsetting those increases was a decrease in comparable store sales from our dressbarn brand 
on a combined pro forma basis  comparable store sales and e commerce sales for the company increased 
our gross margin rate increased by basis points to 
the gross margin rate at our legacy family of brands was flat  as slightly higher margins at maurices were offset by slightly lower margins at justice and dressbarn 
the gross margin rate was negatively affected by the incurrence of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  of one time  non cash inventory expenses associated with the purchase accounting write up of charming shoppes s inventory to fair market value as of the acquisition date 
operating income decreased million  consisting of a million  or  decrease from our legacy family of brands  million of incremental unallocated acquisition related  integration and restructuring costs and a million decrease relating to the acquired operations of lane bryant and catherines 
the operating results of lane bryant and catherines reflected an incremental million in fiscal related to the one time  non cash inventory purchase accounting expense mentioned above and a duplicative corporate overhead structure 
the decreased operating income from our legacy family of brands primarily reflected a decrease in sales and gross margin rate at our dressbarn brand  offset in part by the flow through of margin on the higher sales volume at justice and maurices 
also contributing to the decline in operating income was million of incremental depreciation expense resulting from the opening of new stores during the last twelve months and accelerated depreciation of existing assets whose useful lives were shortened by the company s supply chain and technological integration efforts 
the provision for income taxes from continuing operations decreased by million to million 
the effective tax rate decreased basis points  to for fiscal  from for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of higher tax benefits relating to the accounting for discrete items recognized in fiscal  and lower permanent non deductible items related to the charming shoppes acquisition 
income from continuing operations decreased million to million primarily as a result of the overall decline in operating income  increase in interest expense to service the debt incurred to fund the charming shoppes acquisition and a loss on extinguishment of debt 
these decreases were offset in part by a decrease in the provision for income taxes and the absence of acquisition related  transaction costs incurred during fiscal net income from continuing operations per diluted share decreased by  or  to per share for fiscal from per share for fiscal the decrease in diluted earnings per share results was primarily due to the lower level of net income and an increase in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 
financial condition and liquidity we ended fiscal in a net cash and investments position total cash and cash equivalents  plus short term and non current investments less total debt of million  compared to a net debt position of to million as of the end of fiscal the increase in our net financial position as of july  as compared to july  was primarily due to our operating cash flows  which were partially offset by our use of cash to support our capital expenditures as discussed below under capital spending  the prepayment of debt under our term loan and the use of the available cash and cash equivalents to reduce our outstanding debt under our revolving credit agreement each as defined and discussed below under debt 
our equity increased to billion as of july   compared to billion as of july   primarily due to our net income during fiscal we generated million of cash from operations during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal during fiscal  we used million for the repayment of debt and million for capital expenditures primarily associated with our retail store expansion and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure 
transactions affecting comparability of results of operations and financial condition the comparability of the company operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain transactions  including the charming shoppes acquisition that closed on june   as described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  certain acquisition related  integration  restructuring and transaction costs  accelerated depreciation of fixed assets related to our integration initiatives  certain losses on extinguishment of debt  certain non recurring purchase accounting costs  and pretax charges related to certain one time  executive contractual obligation costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal a summary of the effect of certain of these items on pretax income for each applicable fiscal year presented is noted below references to notes are to the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements fiscal years ended july  july  july  millions acquisition related  integration and restructuring costs corporate related reorganization costs one time  non cash inventory expense associated with the purchase accounting write up of inventory to fair market value accelerated depreciation associated with the company s supply chain and technological integration efforts see note loss on extinguishment of debt see note acquisition related  transaction costs see note executive contractual obligation costs total the following discussion of results of operations highlights  as necessary  the significant changes in operating results arising from these items and transactions

nm not meaningful net sales 
net sales increased by billion  or  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the increase in net sales consisted of organic growth from our legacy family of brands and from the charming shoppes acquisition 
the increase in net sales from our legacy family of brands was driven by both our comparable store sales at justice and new store growth  at both our justice and maurices brands  as well as strong growth in e commerce sales at all of our legacy brands 
partially offsetting those increases was a decrease in comparable store sales from our dressbarn brand 
after giving effect to the charming shoppes acquisition as of the beginning of  comparable store sales were flat during fiscal e commerce sales increased by million  or to million during fiscal from million during fiscal on a combined basis  these two categories increased during fiscal as discussed under the section entitled general economic conditions  our comparable store sales trends during fiscal reflected lower and inconsistent customer traffic and spending patterns  which generally began in november net sales and comparable store sales data for our five business segments is presented below 
fiscal years ended july  july  change change comparable store sales a millions millions net sales justice   lane bryant  nm maurices flat dressbarn   catherines nm total net sales    flat e commerce comparable sales combined store and e commerce comparable sales a comparable store sales generally refers to the growth of sales in only stores open in both the current period and comparative period in the prior year including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions 
the determination of which stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation normally changes at the beginning of each fiscal year  except for stores that close during the fiscal year  which are excluded from comparable store sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes 
however  for acquired stores  such as in the case of lane bryant and catherines  comparable store sales metrics for the initial first year of acquisition reflects sales from the acquisition date through the end of the fiscal period for all stores that were open in both that period and the comparable period in the prior year 
nm not meaningful justice net sales 
the net increase primarily reflects an increase of million  or  in comparable store sales during fiscal  a million increase in non comparable store sales  primarily driven by an increase related to net new store openings in fiscal a million  or  increase in revenues from its e commerce operations  a million increase in wholesale  licensing operations  and other revenues  and a million decrease in revenues from gift card breakage 
lane bryant net sales

the net decrease primarily reflects a decrease of million  or  in comparable store sales during fiscal  a million increase in non comparable store sales  primarily driven by store openings in fiscal the positive effect of the new store openings was partially offset by stores closing during fiscal  and a million  or  increase in revenues from e commerce operations

the gross margin rate was negatively affected by the incurrence of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  of one time  non cash inventory expenses associated with the purchase accounting write up of charming shoppes s inventory to fair market value as of the acquisition date 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors  including changes in the relative sales mix among brands  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing and level of promotional activities  and fluctuations in material costs 
these factors  among others  may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year

sg a expenses also include advertising and marketing costs  information technology and communication costs  supplies for our stores and administrative facilities  insurance costs  legal costs and costs related to other administrative services 
sg a expenses increased by million  or  to billion in fiscal from million in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal sg a expenses  expressed both in dollars and as a percentage of sales  increased largely due to the current  duplicative corporate overhead structure resulting from the charming shoppes acquisition  which is expected to be significantly scaled back over the next couple of years 
from our legacy family of brands  sg a expenses remained flat as a percentage of sales 
depreciation and amortization expense

the margin decrease was due to increased promotional activity 
the increase in buying  distribution and occupancy costs was mainly a result of increases in store occupancy costs  which resulted largely from new store growth and the increased sales volume 
the increase in sg a expenses reflected increases in store related payroll associated with the new store growth  higher third party fulfillment expenses related to e commerce growth and higher marketing costs  offset in part by the absence of million of executive contractual obligation costs which were incurred during fiscal the increase in depreciation expense resulted from the new store growth and accelerated depreciation as a result of the company s supply chain integration efforts

partially offsetting those increases in sg a expenses was a favorable product related vendor settlement 
dressbarn operating income decreased by million primarily as a result of a decrease in sales and gross margin rates and increases in buying  distribution and occupancy costs

the operating results reflect the operation of stores in fiscal for the entire year  as the acquisition was consummated during the fourth quarter of fiscal unallocated acquisition related  integration and restructuring costs 
the unallocated expenses of million in fiscal and million in fiscal represent acquisition related  integration and restructuring costs incurred during the period related to the charming shoppes acquisition

with the current financial environment and the instability of some financial institutions  we cannot be assured we will not experience losses on our deposits in the future 
however  there have been no losses recorded on deposits of cash and cash equivalents to date 
critical accounting policies the sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company results of operations and financial position and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the company estimates are often based on complex judgments  probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable  but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
it is also possible that other professionals  applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances  could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts 
the company believes that the following list represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr for a discussion of all of the company significant accounting policies  see notes and to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventory is valued using the retail method of accounting and is stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventory at cost and resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the retail method are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial merchandise markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the company continuously reviews its inventory levels to identify slow moving merchandise and necessary markdowns to clear slow moving merchandise  which reduces the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value 
consideration is given to a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including current pricing levels and the anticipated need for subsequent markdowns  aging of inventories  historical sales trends  and the impact of market trends and economic conditions 
estimates of markdown requirements may differ from actual results due to changes in quantity  quality and mix of products in inventory  as well as changes in consumer preferences  market and economic conditions 
the company s historical estimates of these costs and its markdown provisions have not differed materially from actual results 
reserves for inventory shrinkage  representing the risk or physical loss of inventory  are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts 
sales returns reserves a significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating product return reserves  which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized 
in particular  retail revenue  including e commerce sales  is reduced by estimates of returns 
in determining estimates of returns  management analyzes historical trends  seasonal results  current economic and market conditions and store performance 
the company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis 
the company historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
rather  goodwill and such indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying values 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and  along with other long lived assets  are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment  the company reviews and considers appraisals from independent valuation firms 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows  market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables 
the impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess 
in addition  in evaluating finite lived intangible assets for recoverability  we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value 
the company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
based on the results of the impairment assessment for fiscal  the company confirmed the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and were not at risk of impairment 
there have been no goodwill or intangible asset impairment losses recorded for any of the periods presented 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment  along with other long lived assets  are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
in evaluating long lived assets for recoverability  we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value  considering external market participant assumptions 
assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
in determining future cash flows  the company takes various factors into account  including changes in merchandising strategy  the emphasis on retail store cost controls  the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending  and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising 
since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance  there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded non cash impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  to reduce the net carrying value of certain long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation and employee healthcare benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
such liabilities are capped through the use of stop loss contracts with insurance companies 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
as of july  and july   these reserves were million and million  respectively 
the company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to insurance and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
the company is self insured for expenses related to its employee medical and dental plans  and its workers compensation plan  up to certain thresholds 
claims filed  as well as claims incurred but not reported  are accrued based on management s estimates  using information received from plan administrators  historical analysis and other relevant data 
the company s stop loss insurance coverage for individual claims ranges between  and  depending on which of the company s multiple insurance carriers the associate is insured under 
the company believes its accruals for claims and contingencies are adequate based on information currently available 
however  it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded accruals for claims and contingencies 
stock based compensation the company has the following stock based compensation arrangements stock options stock options are granted to certain of its employees and non employee directors with exercise prices equal to or exceeding fair market value at the date of grant 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events 
the key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option  the expected stock price volatility factor  the expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate  among others 
generally  once stock option values are determined  current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed  even if the estimates used are different from the actuals 
determining the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant requires significant judgment by management  including estimates of the above black scholes assumptions 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  if management changes its assumptions for future stock based award grants  or if there are changes in market conditions  stock based compensation expense and the company results of operations could be materially impacted 
restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus the company grants restricted shares of common stock and service based rsus to certain of its employees and non employee directors 
in addition  the company grants performance based rsus to senior executives and other key executives  and certain other employees of the company 
the fair values of restricted stock shares and rsus are based on the fair value of unrestricted common stock 
compensation expense for performance based rsus is recognized over the related service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable  which involves judgment on the part of management 
cash settled long term incentive plan awards the company grants cash settled long term incentive plan awards the cash settled ltip awards to senior executives and other key executives none of whom are named executive officers 
the awards entitle the holder to a cash payment equal to the value of the number of shares of the company s common stock earned at the end of a three year performance period 
compensation expense for the cash settled ltip awards is recognized over the related vesting period based on the expected performance of the plan and changes in the company s stock price over time 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income taxes ie  deferred tax assets and liabilities  current taxes payable refunds receivable and tax expense are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between us generally accepted accounting principles and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating loss  capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes  as determined under enacted tax laws and rates 
the company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment 
in addition  valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur  or circumstances change  that warrant adjustments to those balances 
in determining the income tax provision for financial reporting purposes  the company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions 
if the company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  it recognizes the tax benefit 
the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement  presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
these assessments can be complex and require significant judgment  and the company often obtains assistance from external advisors 
to the extent that the company estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
if the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit  the company regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if i there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not  ii the statute of limitations expires  or iii there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency 
uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months 
interest and penalties  if any  are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the company accompanying audited consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company income taxes 
contingencies we are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  including certain litigations  contractual disputes  employee relation matters  various tax audits  and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes 
we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable 
in addition  if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability  we disclose the estimated impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
management considers many factors in making these assessments 
as the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable  these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions 
as a result  the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions
