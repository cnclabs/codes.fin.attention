item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report 
critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe that our accounting policies and estimates relating to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and stock based compensation charges are the most critical 
revenue recognition revenue from corporate collaborations and licensing agreements consists of up front fees  research and development funding and milestone payments 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the related performance period 
we estimate the performance period as the period in which we perform certain development activities under the applicable agreement 
reimbursements for research and development activities are recorded in the period that we perform the related activities under the terms of the applicable agreements 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the applicable agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that such milestone is substantive in nature 
revenue from grants is recognized as we provide the services stipulated in the underlying grants based on the time and materials incurred 
accrued expenses third parties perform a significant portion of our development activities 
we review the activities performed under significant contracts each quarter and accrue expenses and the amount of any reimbursement to be received from our collaborators based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
estimating the value or stage of completion of certain services requires judgment based on available information 
if we do not identify services performed for us but not billed by the service provider  or if we underestimate or overestimate the value of services performed as of a given date  reported expenses will be understated or overstated 
stock based compensation the fair value of stock options granted has been calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make estimates of expected volatility and expected option lives 
we estimate these factors at the time of grant based on our own prior experience  public sources of information and information for comparable companies 
the amount of recorded compensation related to an option grant is not adjusted for subsequent changes in these estimates or for actual experience 
the amount of our recorded compensation is also dependent on our estimates of future option forfeitures 
if we initially over estimate future forfeitures  our reported expenses will be understated until such time as we adjust our estimate 
changes in estimated forfeitures will affect our reported expenses in the period of change and future periods 
the amount and timing of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods related to grants of restricted stock units may be affected by employment terminations 
as a result  stock based compensation charges may vary significantly from period to period 
results of operations year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal  we recognized  in revenue  compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal  pursuant to our license agreement with astrazeneca 
revenue consisted entirely of reimbursement of development costs and per employee compensation  earned at the contractual rate 
we may also earn contract revenue based on the attainment of development milestones 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of costs relating to our phase b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd 

back to table of contents research and development expenses related to our bremelanotide  pl  peptide melanocortin agonist  obesity and other preclinical programs were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the majority of spending was related to our phase b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd 
we are currently completing protocols and preparing for initiation of pivotal phase studies of bremelanotide 
the amount of such spending and the nature of future development activities are dependent on a number of factors  including primarily the availability of funds to support future development activities  success of our clinical trials and preclinical and discovery programs  and our ability to progress compounds in addition to bremelanotide and pl into human clinical trials 
the amounts of project spending above exclude general research and development spending  which decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is the result of closing our research laboratory operations in connection with the lease expiration of our laboratory facilities in july cumulative spending from inception to june  on our bremelanotide  neutrospec a previously marketed imaging product which has been terminated and other programs which includes pl  other melanocortin receptor agonists  obesity and other discovery programs amounts to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
due to various risk factors described in this annual report  including the difficulty in currently estimating the costs and timing of future phase clinical trials and larger scale phase and phase clinical trials for any product under development  we cannot predict with reasonable certainty when  if ever  a program will advance to the next stage of development or be successfully completed  or when  if ever  related net cash inflows will be generated 
see item a risk factors 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal these expenses mainly consist of compensation and related costs 
other income expense other income expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
fiscal other expense included the recognition of million non cash charged for the increase in the fair value of warrants related to the july  private placement offering 
fiscal other income included a gain on disposition of supplies and equipment of million compared to  for fiscal this increase is a result of closing our research laboratory facilities in july for fiscal we recognized  of investment income compared to  of investment income for fiscal income tax benefit income tax benefits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal relate to the sale of new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of such losses and tax credits that we are able to sell depends on annual pools and allocations established by the state of new jersey 
year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal  we recognized million in revenue  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
revenue from astrazeneca for fiscal and fiscal consisted of million and million  respectively  of reimbursement of development costs and per employee compensation  earned at the contractual rate 
fiscal revenue also included million of federal grants under the patient protection and affordable care act of research and development research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of costs relating to our then on going phase b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd  which commenced in june research and development expenses related to our bremelanotide  pl  peptide melanocortin agonists  obesity  neutrospec and other preclinical programs were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
spending was primarily related to our phase b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd 
the amount of such spending and the nature of future development activities are dependent on a number of factors  including primarily the availability of funds to support future development activities  success of our clinical trials and preclinical and discovery programs  and our ability to progress compounds in addition to bremelanotide and pl into human clinical trials 
the amounts of project spending above exclude general research and development spending  which decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease is the result of reducing staffing levels pursuant to our strategic decision announced in september to focus resources and efforts on clinical trials of bremelanotide and pl and preclinical development of an inhaled formula of pl and a new peptide drug candidate for sexual dysfunction 
cumulative spending from inception to june  on our bremelanotide  neutrospec and other programs which includes pl  other melanocortin receptor agonists  obesity and other discovery programs amounts to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
due to various risk factors described in this annual report  including the difficulty in currently estimating the costs and timing of future phase clinical trials and larger scale phase and phase clinical trials for any product under development  we cannot predict with reasonable certainty when  if ever  a program will advance to the next stage of development or be successfully completed  or when  if ever  related net cash inflows will be generated

back to table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase is primarily the result of increases in stock based compensation and professional fees 
other income expense other income was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this increase was attributable to the gain on disposition of supplies and equipment of million as a result of closing our research laboratory facilities in july compared to a loss on disposition of supplies and equipment of  for fiscal fiscal also included a million gain on securities 
for fiscal we recognized  of investment income compared to million for fiscal income tax benefit income tax benefits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal relate to the sale of new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of such losses and tax credits that we are able to sell depends on annual pools and allocations established by the state of new jersey 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have incurred net operating losses  primarily related to spending on our research and development programs 
we have financed our net operating losses primarily through equity financings and amounts received under collaborative agreements 
our product candidates are at various stages of development and will require significant further research  development and testing and some may never be successfully developed or commercialized 
we may experience uncertainties  delays  difficulties and expenses commonly experienced by early stage biopharmaceutical companies  which may include unanticipated problems and additional costs relating to the development and testing of products in animals and humans  product approval or clearance  regulatory compliance  good manufacturing practices gmps  intellectual property rights  product introduction  marketing  sales and competition  and obtaining sufficient capital 
failure to enter into collaboration agreements and obtain timely regulatory approval for our product candidates and indications would impact our ability to increase revenues and could make it more difficult to attract investment capital for funding our operations 
any of these possibilities could materially and adversely affect our operations and require us to curtail or cease certain programs 
during fiscal  we used million of cash for our operating activities  compared to million used in fiscal and million used in fiscal lower net cash outflows from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily the result of decreased costs relating to our phase b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd  while higher net cash outflows from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from lower revenues and the increased costs relating to our phase b clinical trial of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd 
our periodic accounts receivable balances will continue to be highly dependent on the timing of receipts from collaboration partners and the division of development responsibilities between us and our collaboration partners 

back to table of contents during fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million  consisting of million used for the purchase of short term investments   used for capital expenditures offset by the maturity of  of short term investments and  in proceeds from the sale of equipment 
during fiscal  cash provided by investing activities consisted mainly of million from the sale of supplies and equipment 
during fiscal  cash provided by investing activities was million from the sale of available for sale investments 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of million consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the completion of our private placement on july  offset by payments on capital lease obligations of  and payment of withholding taxes related to restricted stock units of  the private placement consisted of the sale of  shares of our common stock  series a warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  and series b warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
aggregate gross proceeds to us were million  with net proceeds  after deducting offering expenses  of million 
during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was  consisting entirely of payments on capital lease obligations 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  primarily from net proceeds pursuant to the completion of our firm commitment public offering that closed on march  offset by payments on capital lease obligations of  and payment of withholding taxes related to restricted stock units of  the offering consisted of the sale of  units at a price to the public of per unit 
the units consisted of  shares of our common stock  series a warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  and series b warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
we have incurred cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts 
as of june   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and our current liabilities were million 
we intend to utilize existing capital resources for general corporate purposes and working capital  including preparing for the phase clinical trial program with bremelanotide for fsd  preclinical development of our peptide mcr program  preclinical and clinical development of our pl program and preclinical development of other portfolio products 
we believe that the phase clinical trial program with bremelanotide will cost at least million 
we do not intend to initiate patient enrollment in the phase program unless we have adequate funds  or commitments for adequate funds  to complete the phase program 
we intend to seek additional capital to support the phase program through collaborative arrangements on bremelanotide  public or private equity or debt financings  or other sources 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our currently planned operations  including submitting complete protocols for pivotal phase studies to the us food and drug administration fda but not initiating patient enrollment  through at least calendar year we anticipate incurring additional losses over at least the next few years 
to achieve profitability  if ever  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and proposed products  conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market such technologies and proposed products 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain  and we do not know whether we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations we have entered into various contractual obligations and commercial commitments
