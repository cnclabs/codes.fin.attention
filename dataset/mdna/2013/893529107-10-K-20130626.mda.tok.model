item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview operational overview 
we are a leading provider of accredited calibration  repair  inspection and compliance services and a distributor of professional grade handheld test  measurement and control instrumentation 
we operate our business through two reportable business segments  service and distribution  which offer a range of services and products to the same customer base 
our strength in our service segment is based upon our wide range of disciplines and our investment in the quality systems that are required in our targeted market segments 
our services range from the calibration and repair of a single unit to managing a customer s entire calibration program 
we believe our service segment offers an opportunity for long term growth and the potential for continuing revenue from established customers with regular calibration cycles and recurring compliance services requirements 
in our distribution segment  our master catalog is widely recognized by both original equipment manufacturers and customers as the ultimate source for test and measurement instruments 
additionally  because we specialize in handheld test and measurement instruments  as opposed to a wide array of industrial products  our sales and customer service personnel can provide value added technical assistance to our customers to aid them in determining what product best meets their particular application requirements 
sales in our distribution segment can be heavily impacted by changes in the economic environment 
as customers increase or decrease capital and discretionary spending  our distribution sales will typically be directly impacted 
the majority of our products are not consumables  but are purchased as replacements  upgrades  or for expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities 
year over year sales growth in any one quarter can be impacted by a number of factors including the addition of new product offerings or channels of distribution 
we evaluate revenue growth in both of our business segments against a trailing twelve month trend  and not by analyzing any single quarter 
financial overview 
in evaluating our results for fiscal year  the following factors should be taken into account fiscal year and the fourth quarter of fiscal year operating results include weeks and weeks  respectively  compared to weeks and weeks for the corresponding periods for fiscal year fiscal year operating results include a full year of operations from cmc and newark  whereas  fiscal year operating results included such operations from their dates of acquisition on april  and september   respectively 
fiscal year operating results include those of anacor and cal matrix from their dates of acquisition on july  and january   respectively 
total revenue for fiscal year was million  a increase compared with total revenue of million for fiscal year service revenue increased to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year of our service revenue in fiscal year  was generated by our calibration centers of excellence while was generated through subcontracted third party vendors  compared with and  respectively  in fiscal year the balance of service revenue was associated with other charges 
distribution sales decreased to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year sales to domestic customers comprised of total distribution sales in fiscal year  while were to canadian customers and were to customers in other international markets 
gross margin for fiscal year was  a basis point decrease compared with gross margin of in fiscal year service gross margin increased to in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year  while distribution gross margin was in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year operating expenses were million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year compared with million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year operating income was million in fiscal year compared with million in fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates the following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  inventory reserves  probability of achievement for performance based restricted stock units  depreciable lives of fixed assets and estimated lives of our major catalogs and intangible assets 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained  and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business 
these amounts are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns in the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable 
we apply a specific formula to our accounts receivable aging  which may be adjusted on a specific account basis where the formula may not appropriately reserve for loss exposure 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the returns reserve is calculated based upon the historical rate of returns applied to revenues over a specific timeframe 
the returns reserve will increase or decrease as a result of changes in the level of revenues and or the historical rate of returns 
inventory 
inventory consists of products purchased for resale and is valued at the lower of cost or market 
costs are determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
inventory is reduced by a reserve for items not saleable at or above cost by applying a specific loss factor  based on historical experience  to specific categories of our inventory 
we evaluate the adequacy of the reserve on a quarterly basis 
at march  and march   we had reserves for inventory losses totaling million and million  respectively 
property and equipment  depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed primarily under the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives years machinery  equipment  and software furniture and fixtures leasehold improvements buildings property and equipment determined to have no value are written off at their then remaining net book value 
we capitalize certain costs incurred in the procurement and development of computer software used for internal purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized under the straight line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of an acquired business 
other intangible assets  namely customer base and covenants not to compete  represent an allocation of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the fair market value measurement requirement 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we have determined that no impairment was indicated as of march  and march  catalog costs 
we capitalize the cost of each master catalog mailed and amortize the cost over the respective catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  modify the period over which costs are recognized 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog over an eighteen month period and amortize the cost of each catalog supplement over a three month period 
total unamortized catalog costs  included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets  were million as of march  and million as of march  deferred taxes 
we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
if necessary  a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is provided for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized based on an assessment of both positive and negative evidence 
see taxes below and note of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
stock based compensation 
we measure the cost of services received in exchange for all equity awards granted  including stock options  warrants and restricted stock units  based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date 
we record compensation cost related to unvested equity awards by recognizing  on a straight line basis  the unamortized grant date fair value over the remaining service period of each award 
excess tax benefits from the exercise of equity awards are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity 
excess tax benefits are realized benefits from tax deductions for exercised awards in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock based compensation costs for such awards 
we did not capitalize any stock based compensation costs as part of an asset 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on our historical experience 
we grant performance based restricted stock units as a primary component of executive compensation 
the units generally vest following the third fiscal year from the date of grant subject to certain cumulative diluted earnings per share growth targets over the eligible period 
compensation cost ultimately recognized for these performance based restricted stock units will equal the grant date fair market value of the unit that coincides with the actual outcome of the performance conditions 
on an interim basis  we record compensation cost based on an assessment of the probability of achieving the performance conditions 
we achieved of the target level for the performance based restricted stock units granted in the fiscal year ended march  and as a result  issued thousand shares of common stock to executive officers and certain key employees during the first quarter of fiscal year at march   we achieved of the target level for the performance based restricted stock units granted in the fiscal year ended march   and we estimated the probability of achievement for the performance based restricted stock units granted in fiscal years and to be and of the target levels  respectively 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding our stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
distribution sales are recorded when an order s title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
we recognize the majority of our service revenue based upon when the calibration or other activity is performed and then shipped and or delivered to the customer 
some of our service revenue is generated from managing customers calibration programs in which we recognize revenue in equal amounts at fixed intervals 
we generally invoice our customers for freight  shipping  and handling charges 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded based upon historical data 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements 
reclassification of amounts 
certain reclassifications of financial information for prior fiscal years have been made to conform to the presentation for the current fiscal year 
in addition  certain reclassifications of financial information for prior fiscal quarters have been made to conform to the presentation for the current fiscal quarters 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for fiscal years and  the components of our consolidated statements of operations 
fy fy gross profit percentage distribution gross profit service gross profit total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue distribution sales service revenue total revenue selling  marketing and warehouse expenses administrative expenses total operating expenses operating income interest and other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  dollars in thousands revenue for the years ended march  march  revenue distribution service total total revenue increased million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year service revenue  which accounted for and of our total revenue in fiscal years and  respectively  increased from fiscal year to fiscal year this growth was primarily due to business acquisitions 
within any year  while we add new customers  we also have customers from the prior year whose calibrations may not repeat for any number of factors 
among those factors are the variations in the timing of customer periodic calibrations on instruments and other services  customer capital expenditures and customer outsourcing decisions 
because the timing of service orders and segment expenses can vary on a quarter to quarter basis  we believe a trailing twelve month trend provides a better indication of the progress of this segment 
our fiscal years and service revenue growth in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons  were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q service revenue growth within the calibration industry  there is a broad array of measurement disciplines making it costly and inefficient for any one provider to invest the needed capital for facilities  equipment and uniquely trained personnel necessary to address all measurement disciplines with in house calibration capabilities 
our strategy has been to focus our investments in the core electrical  temperature  pressure and dimensional disciplines 
accordingly  over the long term  we expect to outsource to of service revenue to third party vendors for calibration beyond our chosen scope of capabilities 
during any individual quarter  we could fluctuate beyond these percentages 
we will continue to evaluate the need for capital investments that could provide more in house capabilities for our staff of technicians and reduce the need for third party vendors in certain instances 
the following table presents the source of our service revenue and the percent of service revenue for each quarter during fiscal years and fy fy q q q q q q q q percent of service revenue depot onsite outsourced freight billed to customers our distribution sales accounted for and of our total revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
year over year distribution sales decreased million  or 
both the economic environment and eight fewer business days in fiscal year versus fiscal year contributed to this decline 
our fiscal years and distribution sales decline growth in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q distribution sales decline growth although distribution sales declined in fiscal year  distribution sales per business day increased to thousand in fiscal year  compared with thousand in fiscal year our distribution sales per business day for each fiscal quarter during the fiscal years and are as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q distribution sales per business day distribution orders include orders for instruments that we routinely stock in our inventory  customized products  and other products ordered less frequently  which we do not stock 
pending product shipments are primarily backorders  but also include products that are requested to be calibrated in our service centers prior to shipment  orders required to be shipped complete or at a future date  and other orders awaiting final credit or management review prior to shipment 
our total pending product shipments increased million  or  at the end of fiscal year compared to the balance at the end of fiscal year increased backorders and orders awaiting credit approval were the primary drivers for this year over year increase 
variations in pending product shipments can be impacted by several factors  including the timing product orders are placed in relation to the end of the fiscal period  specialized product orders that are not stocked  or production issues experienced by manufacturers 
the following table presents the percentage of total pending product shipments that were backorders at the end of each quarter in fiscal years and and our historical trend of total pending product shipments fy fy q q q q q q q q total pending product shipments of pending product shipments that are backorders gross profit for the years ended march  march  gross profit distribution service total total gross profit in fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year as a percentage of total revenue  total gross margin declined basis points over the same time period 
service gross profit increased million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year service gross margin increased basis points from fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily due to increased revenue combined with continued cost control 
our annual and quarterly service gross margins are a function of several factors 
our organic service revenue growth provides incremental gross margin growth by leveraging the relatively fixed cost structure of this segment 
service revenue growth from our recent business acquisitions  while providing a base for future organic revenue growth  may moderate or reduce our gross margins as we acquire additional fixed costs 
the following table presents the quarterly historical trend of our service gross margin as a percent of service revenue fy fy q q q q q q q q service gross margin we evaluate distribution gross profit from two perspectives 
channel gross profit includes net sales less the direct cost of inventory sold 
our distribution gross profit includes channel gross profit as well as the impact of vendor rebates  cooperative advertising income  freight billed to customers  freight expenses and direct shipping costs 
in general  our distribution gross margin can vary based upon the mix of products sold  price discounting  and the timing of periodic vendor rebates and cooperative advertising income received from suppliers 
total distribution gross margin in fiscal year was  a decrease of basis points when compared with in fiscal year distribution gross profit decreased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily a result of increased price discounts extended to customers and lower vendor rebates  partially offset by increased cooperative advertising income 
the following table presents the quarterly historical trend of our distribution gross profit as a percent of distribution sales fy fy q q q q q q q q channel gross margin total distribution gross margin channel gross margin is calculated as net sales less purchase costs divided by net sales 
includes vendor rebates  cooperative advertising income  freight billed to customers  freight expenses  and direct shipping costs 
operating expenses for the years ended march  march  operating expenses selling  marketing and warehouse administrative total operating expenses decreased million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses in fiscal year improved to from in fiscal year reflecting lower performance based compensation  partially offset by one time sales organization restructuring charges  implementation costs of our customer relationship management software and additional direct marketing expenses 
taxes for the years ended march  march  provision for income taxes our effective tax rates for fiscal years and were and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that amounts available under our current credit facility and our cash on hand are sufficient to satisfy our expected working capital and capital expenditure needs as well as our lease commitments for the foreseeable future 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion about our credit facility 
cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows dollars in thousands for the years ended march  march  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year significant working capital fluctuations were as follows inventory accounts payable inventory balance at march  was million  an increase of million when compared to million on hand at march  our inventory strategy includes making appropriate larger quantity  higher dollar based purchases with key manufacturers for various reasons  including maximizing on hand availability of key products  reducing backorders for those products with long lead times and optimizing vendor volume discounts 
as a result  inventory levels from quarter to quarter will vary based on the timing of these larger orders in relation to the quarter end 
in general  our accounts payable balance increases or decreases as a result of timing of vendor payments for inventory receipts 
however  this correlation may vary at a quarter end due to the timing of vendor payments for inventory receipts and inventory shipped directly to customers  as well as the timing of distribution sales 
receivables we continue to generate positive operating cash flows and maintain strong collections on our accounts receivable 
the following table illustrates our days sales outstanding from fiscal year to fiscal year march  march  net sales  for the last two fiscal months accounts receivable  net days sales outstanding investing activities in fiscal year  we invested million in cash  of which million was used for business acquisitions and million was used to purchase property and equipment  primarily to support service segment growth 
in fiscal year  we used million of cash in investing activities  including million for business acquisitions and million to purchase property and equipment primarily for additional service capabilities and infrastructure projects 
financing activities during fiscal year  we received million in cash from financing activities  including million from our revolving line of credit and million from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options 
we used million in cash for financing activities in fiscal year  including million to reduce our revolving line of credit and million to repurchase shares of common stock 
in addition  we received million of cash in fiscal year from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and warrants 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the table below contains aggregated information about future payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments such as debt and lease agreements in millions payments due by period less than more than year years years years total revolving line of credit operating leases total contractual cash obligations due to the uncertainty of forecasting expected variable rate interest payments  this amount excludes the interest portion of the debt obligation 
outlook the deepening of our geographic reach and expansion of our capabilities in our services segment should continue to drive growth  margin expansion and cash flow generation in fiscal year in addition  we expect to realize the full year impact of our fiscal year acquisitions  our expanded focus on strategic business development and the benefit of investments made in our sales organization 
we expect this will more than offset an increasingly price competitive marketplace for our distribution segment and a stagnant economy 
we expect that we will experience disproportionately higher year over year operating income growth in our second and third quarters of fiscal year the successful implementation of our strategies has resulted in revenue growth of nearly and earnings per share growth of over in the last five years 
while maintaining our position as the premier source for the highest quality test and measurement instruments  we believe we are making measureable headway in capturing a greater share of the calibration services market 
looking ahead  we believe we can continue to grow our top line  leverage our infrastructure and further strengthen our earnings power 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our borrowing activities 
in the event interest rates were to move by  our yearly interest expense would increase or decrease by less than million assuming our average borrowing levels remained constant 
as of march   million was available under our credit facility  of which million was outstanding and included in long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
we mitigate our interest rate risk by electing to borrow from our credit facility at the one month libor  adjusting daily  or a fixed rate for a designated period at the libor corresponding to such period  in each case  plus a margin 
our interest rate margin is determined on a quarterly basis based upon our calculated leverage ratio 
as of march   the one month libor was 
our interest rate for fiscal year ranged from to 
on march   we had no hedging arrangements in place to limit our exposure to upward movements in interest rates 
foreign currency over of our revenues for fiscal years and were denominated in us dollars  with the remainder denominated in canadian dollars 
a change in the value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar would impact our revenue by less than 
we monitor the relationship between the us and canadian currencies on a monthly basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in canadian dollars as we believe to be appropriate 
we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that future earnings would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not apply hedge accounting and therefore  the change in the fair value of the contracts  which totaled less than million in each of fiscal years and  was recognized as a component of other expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the change in the fair value of the contracts is offset by the change in fair value on the underlying receivables denominated in canadian dollars being hedged 
on march   we had two foreign exchange contracts  which mature in april and january  outstanding in the notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
we do not use hedging arrangements for speculative purposes
