economic environment the company continued to be the most active provider of financial guaranty insurance in as a result of its financial strength and its ability to maintain strong investment grade financial strength ratings 
all of the company s former financial guaranty competitors have had their financial strength ratings downgraded by rating agencies to below investment grade levels or are no longer rated  severely impacting their ability to underwrite new business 
only two other industry participants have investment grade financial strength ratings today national public finance guarantee corporation  which has been involved in litigation challenging its separation from mbia insurance corporation and appears not to have financial strength ratings adequate to issue new financial guaranty policies on public finance obligations  and build america mutual assurance company  which is a new entrant to the industry that commenced operations during and is gradually increasing its business 
business conditions have been difficult for the entire financial guaranty insurance industry since mid  and the company continues to face challenges in maintaining its market penetration today 
the presence of a new financial guaranty insurer may lead to higher overall insurance penetration of the us municipal bond market or such new insurer may displace the company in certain insured transactions 
the overall economic environment in the us has improved over the last few years and indicators such as lower delinquency rates and more stable housing prices point toward improvement in the housing market 
however  unemployment rates remain too high for a robust general economic recovery to have taken hold and concerns over the fiscal cliff may have hampered the recovery towards the end of municipal credits have experienced budgetary stress since the recent credit crisis and the ensuing recession  compounded in many cases by significant unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities 
while revenues at the state level have been rebounding in general  many local governments have continued to face structural deficits as a result of the decline in property taxes 
although the vast majority of municipalities have been taking steps to address their fiscal challenges  a small number have sought bankruptcy protection 
this is an area of law that has not been tested due to the relatively low frequency of such cases 
the company has been active with respect to the municipal bankruptcy cases involving jefferson county  alabama and the city of stockton  california 
it has also been closely monitoring legal proceedings in other municipal bankruptcy cases 
table of contents in various states 
in addition  the company has been involved with efforts of the city receiver for the city of harrisburg  pennsylvania to develop and implement a fiscal recovery plan for the city 
the publicity surrounding high profile defaults  especially those few where bond insurers are paying claims  provides evidence of the value of bond insurance and may stimulate demand  especially at the retail level 
new issuance volume in the us public finance market increased in as interest rates fell to historic lows 
tight credit spreads and low interest rates tend to suppress demand for bond insurance as the potential savings for issuers are diminished and some investors prefer to forgo insurance in favor of greater yield 
in the international arena  troubled eurozone countries continue to be a source of stress in global equity and debt markets 
following the restructuring of the sovereign debt of greece  debt costs in portugal  spain and italy remain elevated  although they have declined substantially since the announcement on august  by the european central bank that it would undertake outright monetary transactions omt in support of eurozone sovereign bonds 
successful execution of structural reforms is necessary to avert further fiscal stress in those and other european union eu countries 
fiscal austerity programs initiated to address the problems have constrained economic growth and may cause recession 
the rating agencies have downgraded many european sovereign credits within the past year 
the company s exposure to troubled eurozone countries is described in results of operations consolidated results of operations losses in the insured portfolio and insured portfolio selected european exposures 
the current economic environment has had a significant negative impact on the demand by investors for financial guaranty policies  and it is uncertain when or if demand for financial guaranties will return to their pre economic crisis level 
in particular  there has been limited new issue activity and also limited demand for financial guaranties in and in both the global structured finance and international infrastructure finance markets 
the company expects that global structured finance and international infrastructure opportunities will increase in the future as the global economy recovers  issuers return to the capital markets for financings and institutional investors again utilize financial guaranties  although the company cannot assure that this will occur 
in  the company continued to be affected by a negative perception of financial guaranty insurers arising from the financial distress suffered by other companies in the industry during the financial crisis 
in november  s p downgraded the financial strength ratings of agm and agc to aa stable outlook under its revised criteria 
in january  after a ten month review  moody assigned the following lower financial strength ratings a stable for agm  a stable for agc  and baa stable for agre 
because the financial strength ratings of assured guaranty were under review for possible downgrade by moody throughout most of  the company believes the demand for the company insurance product was negatively impacted 
the demand for the company s insurance has also been negatively affected by the credit spread on agc  which is a reflection of the risk that investors perceive in the company  among other factors 
the higher the company credit spread  the lower the benefit of the company s guaranty is to certain investors 
if investors view the company as being only marginally less risky  or perhaps even as risky  as the uninsured security  the coupon on a security insured by the company may not be much lower  or may be the same as  an uninsured security offered by the same issuer 
accordingly  issuers may be unwilling to pay a premium for the company to insure their securities if the insurance does not lower the costs of issuance 
while agc and agm credit spreads were lower at december  compared with december   they remained high compared with their pre credit spreads

net income loss there are several primary drivers of volatility in reported net income or loss that are not necessarily indicative of credit impairment or improvement  or ultimate economic gains or losses changes in credit spreads of insured credit derivative obligations and financial guaranty variable interest entities fg vies assets and liabilities  changes in the company own credit spreads  and changes in risk free rates used to discount expected losses 
changes in credit spreads have the most significant effect on changes in fair value of credit derivatives and fg vie assets and liabilities 
in addition to these factors  changes in expected losses  the timing of refundings and terminations of financial guaranty insurance contracts  realized gains and losses on the investment portfolio  including other than temporary impairments  the effects of large settlements or transactions  and the effects of the company various loss mitigation strategies  among other factors  may also have a significant effect on reported net income or loss in a given reporting period 
net income for declined to million from million in due primarily to unrealized losses on credit derivatives  higher loss and loss adjustment expenses and lower net earned premiums 
over the course of  credit spreads on agc and agm declined  which resulted in unrealized losses in the credit derivative portfolio  while in  those credit spreads increased  resulting in unrealized gains 
in  loss and loss adjustment expenses were higher than due primarily to losses incurred on greek sovereign exposures 
net earned premiums declined due to the scheduled amortization of the insured portfolio  offset in part by higher terminations and refundings of insured obligations 
offsetting the decline in net income were changes in fair value of fg vie assets and liabilities and commutation gains related to the reassumption of previously ceded books of business 
non gaap financial measures non gaap operating income in was million  compared with million in the decline in operating income was primarily driven by losses incurred on greek exposures and lower credit derivative revenues  offset in part by higher commutation gains 
the decline in credit derivative revenues is consistent with expectations as the company no longer writes financial guaranties in derivative form and this book of business amortizes 
adjusted book value was billion and adjusted book value per share was as of december  as compared to billion and per share as of december  adjusted book value increased slightly  mainly due to the issuance of common shares  new business and commutations of reassumed business  partially offset by economic loss development 
adjusted book value per share decreased due to million additional shares outstanding in in june  
table of contents the company issued million common shares which were partially offset by the repurchase of million common shares in see note  shareholders equity  of the financial statements and supplementary data

key business strategies the company has been focused on various strategies to create value loss mitigation  including the pursuit of recoveries for breaches of r w  servicing improvements and the purchase of insured obligations  new business development and reinsurance commutations  and other rating agency capital improvement strategies 
on may   the company acquired municipal and infrastructure assurance corporation  which it has renamed mac  from radian 
mac is licensed to provide financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance in us jurisdictions including the district of columbia 
in january  the company announced its intention to launch mac as a new financial guaranty insurer that provides insurance only on debt obligations in the us public finance markets  in order to increase the company insurance penetration in such market 
loss mitigation the company continued its risk remediation strategies in  which lowered losses and improved rating agency capital 
the following are examples of the strategies employed by the company 
pursuit of r w breaches in an effort to recover us rmbs losses the company experienced in its insured us rmbs portfolio resulting from breaches of r w  the company has pursued r w providers by enforcing r w provisions in contracts  negotiating agreements with r w providers relating to those provisions and  where indicated  initiating litigation against r w providers 
the two largest settlement agreements resulting from these efforts were with bank of america in and deutsche bank in see losses in the insured portfolio and note  expected loss to be paid  of the financial statements and supplementary data  for a discussion of each of these agreements 
in the proceeding agm brought against flagstar bank in new york federal court  the court granted judgment in favor of agm in february on its claims for breach of contract in the amount of approximately million plus contractual interest and attorneys fees and costs to be determined 
flagstar bank has indicated it intends to appeal the decision 
all together these efforts have resulted in the company causing r w providers to pay or agree to pay billion in respect of r w 
the company believes these results  including settlement agreements and trial decisions  are significant and will help it as it continues to pursue r w providers for us rmbs transactions it has insured 
the company continues to enforce contractual provisions and pursue litigation and is in discussions with other r w providers regarding potential agreements 
see recovery litigation in note  expected loss to be paid  of the financial statements and supplementary data  for a discussion of the litigation proceedings the company has initiated against other r w providers 
purchase of below investment grade insured obligations in order to mitigate losses  the company is continuing to purchase attractively priced big obligations that it insured 
these purchases resulted in a reduction to net expected loss to be paid of million as of december  as of december   the fair value of assets purchased or obtained for loss mitigation purposes excluding the value of the company insurance was million  with a par of  million including bonds related to fg vies of million in fair value and million in par 
rmbs servicing intervention the quality of servicing of the mortgage loans underlying an rmbs transaction influences collateral performance and ultimately the amount if any of the company insured losses 
the company has established a group to mitigate rmbs losses by influencing mortgage servicing  including  if possible  causing the transfer of servicing or establishing special servicing arrangements 
special servicing is an industry term referencing more intense servicing applied to delinquent loans aimed at 
table of contents mitigating losses 
special servicing arrangements provide incentives to a servicer to achieve better performance on the mortgage loans it services 
as a result of the company s efforts  at february  the servicing of approximately billion of mortgage loans had been transferred to a new servicer and another billion of mortgage loans were subject to special servicing arrangements 
the december  net insured par of the transactions subject to a servicing transfer was billion and the net insured par of the transactions subject to a special servicing arrangement was billion 
new business development and commutations management believes that the company is able to provide value not only by insuring the timely payment of scheduled interest and principal amounts when due  but also through its underwriting  surveillance and loss mitigation capabilities 
few individual or even institutional investors have the analytic resources to cover the tens of thousands of municipal credits in the market 
for those exposures that the company guarantees  it undertakes the tasks of credit selection  analysis  negotiation of terms  surveillance and  if necessary  loss mitigation 
management believes this allows retail investors to participate more widely  institutional investors to operate more efficiently  and smaller  less well known issuers to gain market access on a more cost effective basis

see non gaap measures pvp or present value of new business production 
us public finance pvp and gross par written have declined over the past two years as a result of record low bond yields on new issuances  tight credit spreads and uncertainty over financial strength ratings of assured guaranty throughout and however  the company us public finance premium rates were consistent by sector with rates in and the average rating of gross par written has remained in the single a category 
the company insured a select number of us structured finance transactions in  including a us commercial receivables securitization and a life insurance reserve financing 
the company uses its agc platform to underwrite new structured finance transactions  while most public finance transactions are written by agm 
pvp for includes million in assumed public finance business from radian  representing the company first third party assumed reinsurance treaty written since on january   the company announced a three part agreement with radian under which it reassumed billion of par it had previously ceded to radian  reinsured approximately billion of us public finance par and agreed to acquire mac 
in addition to the radian reassumption  the company also reassumed billion in par from tokio marine nichido fire insurance co  ltd 
tokio 
the company recognized million in pre tax commutation gains as a result of commutation transactions in and million in the commutations resulted in approximately million in additional future premium earnings 
other rating agency capital improvement strategies in order to reduce leverage and possibly  rating agency capital charges  the company has mutually agreed with beneficiaries to terminate selected financial guaranty insurance and credit derivative contracts 
in particular  the company has targeted investment grade securities for which claims are not expected but which carry a disproportionate rating agency capital charge 
the company terminated billion in net par in and billion in net par in 
table of contents results of operations estimates and assumptions the company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are determined using estimates and assumptions

the following discussion of the results of operations includes information regarding the estimates and assumptions used for these items and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements
