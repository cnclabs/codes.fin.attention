during fiscal year  snowmobile sales increased  driven primarily by increased shipments to canada and other international markets 
north american snowmobile industry retail sales for the year increased  driven primarily by improved snow conditions 
for the year  arctic cat north american retail sales underperformed the market  however we did face difficult comparisons from the previous year where we launched new snowmobile models 
arctic cat did experience strong retail sales in our march ending quarter  with sales up from the previous year ending quarter 
north american dealer inventory increased year over year as retail sales were not as strong as expected during the early part of the snowmobile season 
as we look forward to next year  we remain excited about our snowmobile business 
at our february snowmobile dealer show  we launched new snowmobile models  and also announced the first phase of our engine strategy which included two new snowmobile engines 
one of these new engines is the first arctic cat built snowmobile engine that will be built in our st 
cloud  minnesota  engine plant 
this new cc stroke engine will allow us to enter a new snowmobile market segment that today accounts for of the north american snowmobile industry 
in addition  we also announced a partnership with yamaha where we will gain access to select yamaha engines and we will manufacture select snowmobiles for them 
for fiscal year  we are expecting north american snowmobile industry retail sales to continue their growth and expect the market will grow up to 
with the expected increase in retail sales  and the launch of new snowmobile models and two new engines  our expectations are that we will see our retail sales grow between and 
sales for our atv and side by side business increased for the year driven primarily by our wildcat sport side by sides as well as our existing atv and prowler models

as we look forward to fiscal year  we remain well positioned with new products that were introduced in the last quarter of fiscal year  as well as a strong product pipeline of new products under development 
one of these new products is the all new inch trail legal version of the wildcat 
this new model will allow us to enter a new segment of the side by side industry that accounted for roughly of the side by side market 
we expect to start shipping this model in the later part of fiscal year for fiscal year  we believe the north american core atv industry retail sales will grow up to  and the side by side industry will continue to show strong growth in the to range

inflation inflation historically has not significantly impacted our business 
we generally have been able to offset the impact of increasing costs through a combination of productivity gains and product price increases 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we reviewed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and believe the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on our reported results 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and provide for estimated marketing and sales incentive costs when products are shipped to dealers and distributors pursuant to their order  the price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
we have agreements with finance companies to repurchase products repossessed up to certain limits 
our financial exposure to repurchase products is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance company and the resale value of the repossessed products 
historically  we have not incurred material losses as a result of repurchases nor have we provided a financial reserve for repurchases 
adverse changes in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
marketing and sales incentive costs we provide for various marketing and sales incentive costs which are offered to our dealers and consumers at the later of when the revenue is recognized or when the marketing and sales incentive program is approved and communicated 
examples of these costs include dealer and consumer rebates  dealer floorplan financing assistance and other incentive and promotion programs 
adverse market conditions resulting in lower than expected retail sales or the matching of competitor programs could cause accrued marketing and incentive costs to materially increase if we authorize and communicate new programs to our dealers 
we estimate marketing and sales incentive costs based on expected usage and historical experience 
the accrual for marketing and sales incentive costs at march  and was million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued expenses in our balance sheet 
the increase in this accrual was a result of announced and communicated marketing and sales incentive programs and retail market conditions 
historically  marketing and sales incentive program expenses have been within our expectations 
to the extent current experience differs with previous estimates the accrued liability for marketing and sales incentives is adjusted accordingly 
product warranties we generally provide a limited warranty to the owner of snowmobiles for months from the date of consumer registration and for six months from the date of consumer registration on atvs and rovs 
we provide for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on historical rates and trends and make subsequent 
table of contents adjustments to this estimate as actual claims become known or the amounts are determinable 
adverse changes in actual warranty costs compared to our initial estimates could cause accrued warranty costs to materially change 
the accrual for warranty costs was million and million at march  and  respectively 
historically  actual warranty costs have been within our expectations 
inventories our inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market  with cost based on a first in  first out basis 
we periodically assess inventories for obsolescence and potential excess 
this assessment is based primarily on assumptions and estimates regarding future production demands  anticipated changes in technology or design  historical and expected future sales patterns 
our inventories consist of materials and products that are subject to changes in our planned production of future snowmobile and atv products and competitive market conditions which may cause lower of cost or market adjustments to our finished goods inventory 
if market conditions or future demand are less favorable than our current expectations  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required  which could have an adverse effect on our reported results in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory items that are identified as obsolete or excess are fully reserved on our balance sheet and are generally scrapped 
historically  inventory obsolescence and potential excess costs adjustments have been within our expectations 
product liability and litigation we are subject to product liability claims and other litigation in the normal course of business 
we maintain insurance for product liability claims although we retain a self insured retention accrual within the balance sheet caption insurance within accrued expenses 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses not covered by insurance are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
we utilize historical trends and other analysis to assist in determining the appropriate loss estimate 
adverse changes in the final determination of product liability or other claims made against us could have a material impact on our financial condition 
historically  actual product liability and litigation costs have been within our expectations 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation based on certain assumption inputs within the black scholes model 
these assumption inputs are used to determine an estimated fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant and require subjective judgment 
we assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock based compensation on a regular basis 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the seasonality of our snowmobile and atv production cycles generates significant fluctuations in our working capital requirements during the year 
the following table represents net sales and ending inventories by each quarter in the fiscal years ended march  and first second third fourth total net sales snowmobile atv pg a total net sales inventories net sales snowmobile atv pg a total net sales inventories as a result of increased fourth quarter net sales and fiscal first quarter production  our finished goods inventory balance decreased as of march  compared with march  historically  we have financed our working capital requirements out of available cash balances at the beginning and end of the production cycle and with short term bank borrowings during the middle of the cycle 
we believe current available cash and cash generated from operations together with working capital financing through our available line of credit will provide sufficient funds to finance operations on a short and long term basis 
however  there can be no assurance that adequate working capital financing arrangements will remain available or that the costs and other terms of such new financing arrangements will not be significantly less favorable to us than has historically been available 
cash and short term investments cash and short term investments increased to  at march  from  at march  because of improved profitability and working capital management 
our cash balances traditionally peak early in the fourth quarter and then decrease as working capital requirements increase when our snowmobile and spring atv production cycles begin 
our investment objectives are first  safety of principal and second  rate of return 
financing arrangements and cash flows we have operated since november under a  secured bank credit agreement for the documentary and stand by letters of credit and for working capital purposes 
we may borrow up to  during june through november and up to  during all other months of the fiscal year 
the total letters of credit issued at march  were  of which  was issued to suzuki for engine and service parts purchases 
we have agreements with ge commercial distribution finance in the united states and tcf commercial finance canada in canada to provide snowmobile  atv and rov floorplan financing for our dealers 
these 
table of contents agreements improve our liquidity by financing dealer purchases of products without requiring substantial use of our working capital 
we are paid by the floorplan company s shortly after shipment and as part of our marketing programs  we pay the floorplan financing of our dealers for certain set time periods depending on the size of a dealer s order 
the financing agreements require repurchase of repossessed new and unused units and set limits upon our potential liability for annual repurchases 
the aggregate potential liability was approximately  at march  we have incurred no material losses under these agreements 
we believe current available cash and cash generated from operations provide sufficient funding in the event there is a requirement to perform under these guarantee and repurchase agreements 
the financing agreements also have loss sharing provisions should any dealer default whereby the company shares certain losses with the floorplan finance companies 
the potential liability to the company under these provisions is approximately  at march  in fiscal  we invested  in capital expenditures 
we expect that capital expenditures will increase to approximately  in fiscal since  we have repurchased over  shares of our common stock 
there is approximately  remaining on the january share repurchase authorization 
in may  the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to  of the company s common stock 
we believe that cash generated from operations and available cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure  and common stock repurchase requirements on a short and long term basis 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant future contractual obligations at march  in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations we have outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers and vendors at march  for raw materials and other supplies as part of the normal course of business 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange rates and interest rates during fiscal  approximately of our total cost of goods sold was purchased from japanese yen denominated suppliers 
the majority of these purchases were made from suzuki  which supplies engines for our snowmobiles 
we have an agreement with suzuki for snowmobile engine purchases to share the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen above and below a fixed range contained in the agreement 
engine purchases from yamaha are in japanese yen  but there were no purchases in fiscal during fiscal  the exchange rate fluctuation between the us dollar and the japanese yen had a modest negative impact on our operating results 
sales to canadian dealers are made in canadian dollars with the us dollar serving as the functional currency 
during fiscal  sales to canadian dealers comprised of total net sales 
during fiscal  the exchange rate fluctuation between the us dollar and the canadian dollar had a modest impact on operating profits 
during fiscal  we utilized cash flow hedges to mitigate the variability in canadian exchange rate changes relating to canadian dollar fund transfers to the united states 
at march  we have canadian dollar forward exchange contracts outstanding with a notional amount of sales to european on road atv dealers and distributors are made in euros with the euro serving as the functional currency 
during fiscal  sales to european on road atv dealers comprised of total net sales 
during fiscal  the exchange rate fluctuation between the us dollar and the euro had no significant impact on operating profits 
interest rate market risk is managed for cash and short term investments by investing in a diversified frequently maturing portfolio consisting of municipal bonds and money market funds that experience minimal volatility 
the carrying amount of our short term investments approximate related fair value and the associated market risk is not deemed to be significant 
we are a party to a secured bank line of credit arrangement under which we currently may borrow an aggregate of up to  the total letters of credit issued  under this arrangement  at march  were  of which  was issued to suzuki for engine and service parts purchases 
interest is charged at variable rates based on either libor or the prime rate 
because the interest rate risk related to the line of credit is not deemed to be significant  we do not actively manage this exposure
