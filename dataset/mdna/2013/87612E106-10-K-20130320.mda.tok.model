our financial results in our us retail segment reflect increased sales of percent over the same period last year due to a percent comparable store increase  the contribution from new stores and the additional week in our us retail segment earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda margin rate decreased slightly from the prior period  primarily due to a lower gross margin rate from our redcard rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program 
our earnings before interest expense and income taxes ebit margin rate remained consistent with the prior year due to a decrease in our depreciation and amortization rate 

table of contents in the us credit card segment  we experienced a decrease in segment profit due to annualizing over a significant reserve reduction in the prior year and lower finance charge revenue resulting from a smaller portfolio 
these changes were partially offset by lower interest expense due to repayment of  million in collateralized debt in the fourth quarter of  as well as the additional week in the and loss in our canadian segment totaling million and million  respectively  is comprised of start up costs and depreciation related to our entry into the canadian retail market 
credit card receivables transaction on october   we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to td bank group td 
historically  our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
with this agreement  our receivables are classified as held for sale at february   and are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value 
we recorded a gain of million outside of our segments in  representing the net adjustment to eliminate our allowance for doubtful accounts and record our receivables at lower of cost par or fair value 
on march   we completed the sale to td for cash consideration of billion  equal to the gross par value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing 
concurrent with the sale of the portfolio for billion  we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables series variable funding certificate at par of billion  resulting in net cash proceeds of billion 
as of march   we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt 
over time  we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investment grade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program 
following this sale  td will underwrite  fund and own target credit card and target visa receivables in the us td will control risk management policies and oversee regulatory compliance  and we will perform account servicing and primary marketing functions 
we will earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the target credit card and target visa portfolios 
this transaction will be accounted for as a sale  and the receivables will no longer be reported on our consolidated statements of financial position 
in the first quarter of  we will recognize a gain on sale of million related to consideration received in excess of the recorded amount of the receivables 
consideration received includes cash of billion and a beneficial interest asset of million 
the beneficial interest effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit sharing we expect to receive on the receivables sold 
based on historical payment patterns  we estimate that the beneficial interest asset will be reduced over a four year period  with larger reductions in the early years 
as a result  a portion of the profit sharing payments we receive from td in the first four years of the arrangement will not be recorded as income on our consolidated statements of operations 
following the sale of our credit card portfolio in  income from the profit sharing arrangement  net of account servicing expenses  will be recognized within sg a expenses 
including the profit sharing arrangement in the us segment will reduce the sg a rate below the historical us retail segment sg a rate  and raise ebitda and ebit margin rates above historical us retail segment rates 
for comparison purposes  historical us retail segment and us credit card segment results will be restated to form a new us segment 
the combination of these two historical segments into a single us segment will result in a higher sg a rate in compared with  and  reflecting credit card profit that will be retained by td beginning in although we expect lower ebitda and ebit margin rates in the us segment compared with prior periods  we expect that the impact of the receivables sale transaction will become neutral and ultimately accretive to eps over time

refer to the merchandise section in item  business  for additional product category information 
comparable store sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable  prior year period of equivalent length 
the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry 
as a result  our comparable store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
comparable store sales include all sales  except sales from stores open less than thirteen months 
comparable store sales comparable store sales change drivers of change in comparable store sales number of transactions average transaction amount selling price per unit units per transaction 
table of contents the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic  competitive and consumer behavioral factors  as well as sales mix  and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible 
credit is offered to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards the target credit card and the target visa target credit cards 
additionally  we offer a branded proprietary target debit card 
collectively  we refer to these products as redcards 
since october  guests receive a percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout  every day  when they use a redcard 
in november  guests also began to receive free shipping at target 
com when they use their redcard 
we monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using redcards redcard penetration because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target  with the remainder representing a shift in tender type 
redcard penetration target credit cards target debit card total store redcard penetration gross margin rate our gross margin rate was percent in  percent in and percent in the decrease in each period reflects the impact of our integrated growth strategies of our redcard rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program  which impacted the rate by percent and percent in and  respectively  partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories in the redcard rewards loyalty program reduces gross margin rates because it drives incremental sales among guests who receive a percent discount on virtually all items purchased 
the remodel program reduces the overall gross margin rate because it drives incremental sales with a stronger than average mix in lower than average gross margin rate product categories  primarily food 
we changed certain merchandise vendor contracts beginning in as a result  we expect our gross margin rate to increase by about to basis points from prior years  with an equal and offsetting increase in our sg a rate 
this shift will result from a larger proportion of vendor income offsetting cost of sales as compared to certain advertising expenses within sg a 
this change will have no impact on our ebitda or ebit margins or margin rates as our sg a rate will increase by the same amount 
in january we announced plans to price match top online retailers year round 
based on our experience during the holiday season  we do not expect this change to significantly affect our gross margin rate 
selling  general and administrative expense rate our sg a expense rate was percent  percent and percent in  and  respectively 
the change in was primarily due to improvements in store hourly payroll expense  which impacted the rate by percent  and continued disciplined expense management across the company  partially offset by technology and multichannel investments  which impacted the rate by nearly percent 
the change in was primarily due to increased loyalty program charges to the us credit segment and favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense 
as noted above  a change to certain merchandise vendor contracts is expected to increase our sg a rate by about to basis points because vendor funding will no longer offset certain advertising expenses 
this change will have no impact on our ebitda or ebit margins or margin rates as our gross margin rate will increase by the same amount 
following the sale of our credit card portfolio in  income from the profit sharing arrangement  net of account servicing expenses  will be recognized as an offset to sg a expenses 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense rate our depreciation and amortization expense rate was percent  percent and percent in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was due to the favorable impact of higher sales combined with stable depreciation and amortization expenses  reflecting the moderate pace of capital investments in recent years  and the impact from the additional week in store data change in number of stores beginning store count opened closed relocated ending store count number of stores remodeled during the year number of stores retail square feet a number of stores and retail square feet february  january  february  january  target general merchandise stores expanded food assortment stores supertarget stores citytarget stores total a in thousands  reflects total square feet less office  distribution center and vacant space

we also measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to libor at the portfolio level 
this metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio by measuring the difference between ebit earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio

these amounts combined represent net write offs 
period end and average credit card receivables  at par  have declined because of an increase in payment rates and a decrease in target visa charges at third parties  partially offset by an increase in charges at target over the past two years 
the decrease in charges at third parties is primarily due to the fact that we no longer issue new target visa accounts

various income tax matters were resolved in and which reduced tax expense by million and million  respectively 
a tax rate reconciliation is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our effective income tax rate decreased to percent in  from percent in  primarily due to a reduction in the structural domestic effective tax rate 
this reduction was slightly offset by a reduction in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the unfavorable impact of losses in canada  which are tax effected at a lower rate than us earnings 
various income tax matters were resolved in and which reduced tax expense by million and million  respectively

our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short term investments 
this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short term instruments that mature in days or less 
we also place certain dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments 
cash flows our operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds 
cash flow provided by operations was  million in compared with  million in during  we issued billion of unsecured debt that matures in july  and we amended the series variable funding certificate to obtain additional funding of million and to extend the maturity to these cash flows  combined with our prior year end cash position  allowed us to fund capital expenditures  pay current maturities  pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program 
our period end credit card receivables  at par  were  million compared with  million in  a decrease of percent 
average credit card receivables  at par  in decreased percent compared with levels 
this change was driven by the factors indicated in the us credit card segment above 
as of february    million of our credit card receivables portfolio was funded by third parties 
on october   we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to td bank group td 
on march   we completed the sale to td for cash consideration of billion  equal to the gross par value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing 
concurrent with the sale of the portfolio  we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables series variable funding certificate at par of billion  resulting in net cash proceeds of billion 
as of march   we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt 
over time  we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investment grade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program 
year end inventory levels decreased slightly from  million in to  million in  primarily due to supply chain management improvements and continued disciplined inventory management  partially offset by an increase in inventory for our canadian retail market entry 
accounts payable increased by million  or percent over the same period 
share repurchases during the first quarter of  we completed a billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in november  and began repurchasing shares under a new billion program authorized by our board of directors in january during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for a total investment of  million per share 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for a total investment of  million per share 
dividends we paid dividends totaling million in and million in  for an increase of percent 
we declared dividends totaling million per share in  for an increase of percent over we declared dividends totaling million per share in  an increase of percent over we have 
table of contents paid dividends every quarter since our initial public offering  and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future 
short term and long term financing our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets  to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility  and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities 
within these parameters  we seek to minimize our borrowing costs 
our ability to access the long term debt  commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity 
our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors  including the condition of debt capital markets  our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings 
as of february   our credit ratings were as follows credit ratings standard and poor moody fitch long term debt a a a commercial paper p a f if our credit ratings were lowered  our ability to access the debt markets  our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted 
each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above 
as a measure of our financial condition  we monitor our interest coverage ratio  representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges 
fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense 
our interest coverage ratio was x in  x in and x in in  we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds 
in  we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued 
commercial paper dollars in millions maximum daily amount outstanding during the year average amount outstanding during the year amount outstanding at year end weighted average interest rate we have additional liquidity through a committed billion revolving credit facility obtained in october and expiring in october no balances were outstanding at any time during or under this facility 
most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels 
our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant 
we are  and expect to remain  in compliance with these covenants  and these covenants have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends 
additionally  at february   no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade  except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control  and ii our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade  or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade 
we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations  finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives  pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future 
we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long term financing 

table of contents capital expenditures capital expenditures a millions us canada total us canada total new stores store remodels and expansions information technology  distribution and other total a see note to our consolidated financial statements for capital expenditures by segment 
the decrease in capital expenditures in from the prior year was primarily driven by the purchase of zellers leases in canada in and fewer store remodels in the us in  partially offset by continued investment in new stores in the us and canada and technology and multichannel investments 
we expect approximately billion of capital expenditures in  reflecting an estimated billion in our us segment and approximately billion in our canadian segment

the timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees  forecasted investment returns  and the projected timing of future retirements 

table of contents e estimated tax contingencies of million  including interest and penalties  are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
f real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase  construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities 
g purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases  merchandise royalties  equipment purchases  marketing related contracts  software acquisition license commitments and service contracts 
we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business  which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms 
we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments  therefore  they are excluded from the table above 
if we choose to cancel a purchase order  we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation 
we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business  which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met 
h we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of february  our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements  plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations above  we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 
critical accounting estimates our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions 
however  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales 
under this method  inventory is stated at cost using the last in  first out lifo method as determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping ending retail value 
the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory  freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores  and import costs  reduced by vendor income and cash discounts 
the majority of our distribution center operating costs  including compensation and benefits  are expensed in the period incurred 
since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market 
we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns 
our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts 
historically  our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable 
markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished 
inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change  including changing consumer demand  guest preferences  changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition 
we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months 
inventory was  million and  million at february  and january   respectively  and is further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents vendor income receivable cost of sales and sg a expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors 
this vendor income is earned for a variety of vendor sponsored programs  such as volume rebates  markdown allowances  promotions and advertising allowances  as well as for our compliance programs 
we establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received 
based on the agreements in place  this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned 
the majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly 
historically  adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material 
vendor income receivable was million and million at february  and january   respectively  and is described further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
credit card receivables accounting historically  our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
when receivables were recorded  we recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write offs 
the allowance included provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit related fees 
we estimated future write offs based on historical experience of delinquencies  risk scores  aging trends and industry risk trends 
accounts were automatically written off when they became days past due 
management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts was appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable  however  unexpected  significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could have materially changed these expectations 
as of february   our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value because they are classified as held for sale as a result of the credit card receivables transaction 
lower of cost par or fair value is determined on a segmented basis using the delinquency and credit quality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
many nondelinquent balances are recorded at cost par because fair value exceeds cost 
delinquent balances are generally recorded at fair value  which reflects our expectation of losses on these receivables 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our credit card receivables 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount 
measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value 
fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value  as appropriate 
a percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close as of february  would result in additional impairment of million in historically  we have not realized material losses upon sale of long lived assets 
insurance self insurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability  workers compensation  property loss and team member medical and dental claims 
however  we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks 
liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported 
we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses 
general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value  other liabilities referred to above are not discounted 
our workers compensation and general liability accrual was million and million at february  and january   respectively 
we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate  however  our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions 
for example  a percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically  adjustments to our estimates have not been material 
refer to item a for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures 

table of contents income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes  regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items  and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities 
the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities 
we periodically reassess these probabilities  and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate 
liabilities for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  were million and million at february  and january   respectively 
we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes are described further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement health care accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan  as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members 
the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs 
eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members full time or part time status  date of hire and or length of service 
the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long term rate of return  the discount rate and compensation growth rates 
the assumptions used to determine the period end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year  with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent is determined by the portfolio composition  historical long term investment performance and current market conditions 
our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans assets was percent  percent  percent and percent for the year  year  year and year periods  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in our expected long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million 
the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds  using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities 
our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
a percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million 
based on our experience  we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger  shorter service pension eligible team members than it does for older  longer service pension eligible team members 
pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
legal contingencies we are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents 
historically  adjustments to our estimates have not been material 
we believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities 
we do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
however  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations  cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs  or future periods 
new accounting pronouncements we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at february   our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations  some of which are at a libor plus floating rate  and on our credit card receivables  the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a prime based floating rate 
historically  to manage our net interest margin  we generally maintained levels of floating rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuated 
the degree of floating asset and liability matching varied over time and in different interest rate environments 
at february   the amount of floating rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating rate debt obligations by approximately billion 
see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the sale of our consumer credit card portfolio  funding risk was transferred to td bank group 
following the sale  our interest rate exposure will primarily be due to the extent by which our floating rate debt obligations differ from our floating rate short term investments 
in general  we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments 
we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value  therefore  these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
periodically  in certain interest rate environments  we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes 
based on our balance sheet position at february   the annualized effect of a percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by million 
in addition  we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans 
a percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million 
the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates 
to protect against 
table of contents declines in interest rates  we hold high quality  long duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust 
at year end  we had hedged percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status 
as more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified  unfunded deferred compensation plans 
we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans 
the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant 
we are exposed to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we will be further exposed to this risk as we commence canadian operations during during and  gains and losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates were not significant as all stores were located in the united states  and the vast majority of imported merchandise was purchased in us dollars 
there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year
