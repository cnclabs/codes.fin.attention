business overview and presentation the market challenges we experienced in late continued into our thin films business unit faced very weak markets in flat panel display and thin film renewables as compared to and also saw softening in the semiconductor market 
our solar energy business unit continued to grow in as we expanded our presence in the canadian market and were awarded several large utility scale projects in the united states 
we continued to execute on our long term strategic initiatives announced in the third quarter of  focusing on re aligning our business to better meet the needs of our customers 
these initiatives have positioned us well to weather the current market downturn and quickly respond when overall economic conditions improve and capacity expansions begin in the markets we serve 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note operations and summary of significant accounting 
table of contents policies and estimates to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting positions described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting positions require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
in most transactions  we have no obligations to our customers after the date products are shipped  other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
for customers purchasing our solar energy products  we provide installation  support  and services after the product has been shipped 
for arrangements containing these additional elements  we allocate revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of the selling price of each individual element of the arrangement 
as we also sell these additional elements separately  the evidence is our selling price for those elements when sold separately 
we defer the revenue of any undelivered elements until the undelivered element is delivered 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers  if any  are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
we maintain a credit approval process and we make significant judgments in connection with assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
the customers purchasing our solar energy products require larger credit limits than those purchasing our thin film products 
despite this assessment  from time to time  our customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
we continuously monitor our customers credit worthiness  and use our judgment in establishing a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivable and our future operating results 
additionally  if our credit loss rates prove to be greater than we currently estimate  we could record additional reserves for doubtful accounts 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments in excess of our current estimates could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
we offer warranty coverage for a majority of our thin film products for periods typically ranging from to months after shipment 
we warrant our solar inverter products for five to ten years and provide the option to purchase additional warranty coverage up to years 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our products under such warranties based on the historical costs of the repairs 
the assumptions we use to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically  in light of actual experience  and when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
should product failure rates differ from our estimates  actual costs could vary significantly from our expectations 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets we completed our acquisitions of pv powered in may and solvix in november for total costs of million and million  respectively 
the total cost of the solvix acquisition includes million of contingent consideration to be paid out over a three year period upon completion of specific milestones 
as a result of our acquisitions  we recorded intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing  as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
the annual impairment test can be performed using an assessment of qualitative factors in determining if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired 
if this assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired the next step of impairment testing compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
goodwill would be impaired if the resulting implied fair value of goodwill was less than the recorded carrying value of the goodwill 
we have performed an assessment of qualitative factors for our annual impairment test in and the factors reviewed included macroeconomic conditions  industry and 
table of contents market conditions  cost factors  and overall financial performance of our solar inverter business 
this assessment resulted in the conclusion that there is no impairment of goodwill 
finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we use the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows and other fair value measurements 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon our estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows are significantly diminished  intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
additionally  the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to our carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to our results of operations 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
when structuring our operations  we have considered the impact on our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rates differs from the us statutory rate due to factors such as foreign operations taxed at different tax rates  research and development tax credits  and non deductible compensation 
our effective tax rate was   and for   and  respectively 
our determination of our tax liability requires estimation and significant judgment and is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities 
our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings 
in addition to local country tax laws and regulations  our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations 
at december   million of earnings had been indefinitely reinvested outside the us  primarily in active us business operations 
we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations and  accordingly  we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties  if applicable 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
business environment and trends semiconductors investment in semiconductor capital equipment spending decreased overall worldwide by roughly vs 
with the maturing integrated circuit end markets largely correlated to worldwide gross domestic product and continuing consolidation at both the integrated circuit company level and the semiconductor equipment level  a relatively strong semiconductor capital investment rate experienced in the first half of fell to lower levels in the second half of the year 
in the second half of there were push outs and reductions in spending plans on new investment as integrated circuit inventories and foundry utilization rates rose while there was uncertainty over large end users integrated circuit foundry strategy and the macroeconomic environment 
larger semiconductor equipment manufacturers are faced with increasing research and development challenges as they develop sub nanometer nm technology node products and processes while simultaneously developing phase i prototype mm tools for evaluation by consortia and end users 
these two drivers have sped innovation and increased the 
table of contents number of new highly capable power generator and matching network opportunities 
smaller semiconductor equipment manufacturers continue to emerge in korea developing both plasma enhanced chemical vapor pecvd and etch technologies initially for memory processes with new penetrations into leading edge foundries 
we believe that we are well positioned to offer both the depth and breadth of products required for the leading edge of product development at the larger oems and have the localization and customization positioning necessary to take advantage of the emerging asia based semiconductor equipment companies 
looking forward  we believe that semiconductor equipment investment will be largely flat with optimism for an increase in the second half of we believe foundries and logic integrated circuit customers will continue to invest for leading edge capability and to develop sub nm capacity and to capture shifts in fabless and fab lite supply chain shifts 
we believe memory investments will likely continue to remain suppressed in the first half of  with capital investments perhaps beginning in the second half of the year 
volatility will continue as shifts in buying preferences for tablets vs 
personal computers and the introduction of new mobility technologies will open opportunities that will be pursued by semiconductor equipment manufacturers with leading technologies  shortest lead times  and aggressive pricing 
we believe we are one of the leaders in advanced rf technologies and matching networks with enabling tune while pulsing extra space capabilities for plasma control and should be well positioned to continue market penetration in etch  pecvd  and physical vapor deposition pvd applications 
flat panel display growth in our flat panel display fpd market is driven by both capacity expansion and investment in new technologies  particularly in the development of next generation high definition televisions  smart phones and tablet computers 
in  fpd investment paused significantly as the end market for displays absorbed the generation liquid crystal display lcd capital that equipment manufacturers procured in the pause was exacerbated by lower manufacturer profitability  which limited new lcd equipment purchases 
in addition  technical issues limited the deployment of robust manufacturing processes for next generation amoled displays 
overall  we expect flat panel display sales to improve throughout most of as customers are now investing in generation and amoled capacity and plan to migrate to generation amoled as soon as the technology is proven 
we believe we are well positioned to benefit from growth in both etch and pvd process technologies where we hold strong technology and market positions 
similar to the semiconductor market  new korean equipment suppliers are emerging and capturing market share in fpd 
our continued investment in expanded localized korean capabilities brings us closer to our customers and enhances our responsiveness to their evolving needs 
thin film renewables demand for our crystalline silicon c si pv products in europe and china  which drove strength in renewables sales in  decreased significantly in declines in pv module prices  along with an oversupply of panel and capital equipment  negatively impacted thin film renewables sales throughout as a result of this oversupply and uncertain demand in the major pv markets  wafer  cell and module production capacity is likely to stall until at the earliest 
many of the largest suppliers of pv products  along with smaller chinese solar companies  will most likely run their plants below capacity  and many may cease production completely 
this scenario will have an adverse impact on our sales in this market for the foreseeable future 
thin film solar manufacturing process for copper indium gallium selenide cigs and cadmium telluride cdte  will drive increased capacity as the technology matures  therefore  the relative market share of thin film renewables in cigs and cdte should remain constant for the foreseeable future 
our power conversion technologies for both ac and dc sputtering are well positioned in these markets and we will benefit from increased demand due to more rigorous customer requirements and an increased manufacturing focus on production output and costs relative to yield 
industrial markets throughout  demand for our products used in many industrial thin film coating markets increased  particularly in industrial manufacturing areas for products such as automotive parts  machine tools  electro magnetic interference emi films  and optical and tribilogical coatings 
we expect this demand to continue in the acquisition of the solvix product line of industrially hardened dc  pulsed dc and arc supplies strengthens our position in these markets 
the solvix products will also allow us to participate in emerging  precision hard coating markets as hardware manufacturers in these markets seek longer lasting films  improved process control and require more flexibility to address diverse hard coating applications 

table of contents inverter global power needs are expected to grow significantly in the next ten years 
to meet these demands  suppliers and users of electricity are continuously seeking renewable sources of energy 
this has resulted in growth opportunities in the solar energy market 
continued advances in inverter technology and greater scale has made solar energy more economically viable and resulted in more rapid expansion of its use worldwide 
growth in multi megawatt projects is expected to continue  particularly in north america 
canada has adopted feed in tariffs that will make these projects even more attractive to investors and utilities 
although certain tax incentives in the united states expired at the end of  we have continued to see investment in large utility scale projects 
results of operations our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will facilitate an understanding of our historical performance and relevant trends going forward 
our results of operations include the operating results of pv powered for the full years ended december  and december  and the period may  through december  results of operations include the results of solvix for the period november  through december  operating results applicable to our gas flow control business are excluded from our results of continuing operations for all periods presented 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  in item of this annual report on form k 
segment reporting in fiscal in january  management announced the creation of two focused business units within the company  thin films and solar energy 
the thin films business unit principally serves our oem and end customers in the semiconductor  flat panel display  solar panel  and other capital equipment markets  while the solar energy business unit focuses primarily on commercial and utility scale solar projects and installations  selling primarily to distributors  engineering  procurement  and construction contractors epc s  developers  and utility companies 
the creation of these two units enables greater focus on each business unique needs and requirements  allowing each to expand and accelerate our growth by better serving each of these very different industries 
due to the structure of our internal organization  the design of our internal systems  and the manner in which expenses were tracked and managed  we are unable to recast our financial statements by operating segment for without significant cost and effort 
therefore  except for revenue  segment information based on the two new business units for has not been reported as it is impracticable to do so

in thousands thin films semiconductor capital equipment market non semiconductor capital equipment global support total thin films solar energy total sales years ended december  thin films semiconductor capital equipment market non semiconductor capital equipment global suppoirt total thin films solar energy total sales total sales total sales for the twelve months ended december  decreased to million from million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in sales was driven by a significant decline in capital spending in all the thin film markets that we serve 
although there was softness in the semiconductor market throughout  the non semiconductor market  particularly flat panel displays and thin film renewables  was the primary driver behind the decline in sales from excess manufacturing capacity and overall uncertainty in these markets significantly reduced demand in late and throughout the decline in sales for our thin films business unit was partially offset by increased sales in solar energy  which were driven by increased sales in the utility market 
total sales increased to million in as compared to million in the increase in sales was driven by a significant increase in inverter sales by our solar energy business unit 
the increase in inverter sales in was due to growth in overall demand in north america for commercial and utility scale solar applications 
the increase in solar energy was partially offset by a slight decline in sales of our thin films business unit caused by a slowdown in demand in all of our end markets  particularly in the second half of the year 
this slowdown was the direct result of uncertainty in the 
table of contents global economy  caused by lower consumer spending on products such as desktop computers  laptops  and high definition flat panel televisions 
thin films results for thin films for the twelve months ended december    and are as follows in thousands years ended december  sales operating income sales compared to thin film sales for declined as compared to reflecting continued weakness in the semiconductor markets along with significant declines in the flat panel display and solar panel markets as described above 
in  sales in our thin film semiconductor market decreased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales in in late  capital expansion by our customer end users began to slow in the semiconductor market and foundry utilization rates have continued to remain lower throughout than previous levels 
current market expectations indicate that capital spending will continue to remain low  therefore we expect revenues in this market to remain largely flat with optimism for an increase in the second half of sales to the non semiconductor capital equipment markets decreased to million  or of sales in  from million  or of sales in the markets that comprise our non semiconductor capital equipment markets include flat panel display  thin film renewables  data storage  architectural glass  and other industrial thin film manufacturing equipment markets 
our customers in these markets are predominantly large oems 
each of these markets was also adversely impacted by lower capital spending and factory utilization rates  although the impact in each was slightly different 
sales to customers in the flat panel display market decreased to million  or of total sales in as compared to million  or of total sales in a drop in overall demand for flat panel televisions resulted in production overcapacity in this  coupled with delays in technology transitions  negatively impacted sales to this market as manufacturers delayed further investment 
we are optimistic that the transition to newer technologies will occur in resulting in higher sales in this market 
sales to customers in the thin film renewables market decreased to million  or of total sales in as compared to million  or of total sales in a worldwide excess of solar panel manufacturing capacity and inventory  particularly in the prc  resulted in a significant decline in sales to the solar panel market 
there has not been enough marketplace demand to absorb the high levels of worldwide inventory on hand resulting in competitive consolidation of a number of solar panel manufacturers 
new investment is not anticipated in the foreseeable future as these market dynamics continue to play out 
as a result  we expect sales to this market to remain low throughout global support revenue for decreased to million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales in although service activity levels were stable in most of our geographic regions  factory utilization rates in both the flat panel display and solar panel markets had a negative impact on our customer maintenance budgets and the need for repairs 
in june  we ceased providing service for the gas flow control business that we sold in we expect demand for repair and preventive maintenance services to increase in the first half of as factory utilization rates in markets other than flat panel display and thin film renewables level out and maintenance budgets begin to increase 
sales compared to thin film sales for declined as compared to as a result of weakening economic conditions across all of our thin film markets in the second half of the year 
this economic uncertainty tempered demand for consumer electronics  which drives capital spending throughout the markets we serve 
in  sales in our thin film semiconductor market decreased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales in the first half of the year saw a continuation of the growth experienced in as a 
table of contents transition from dram to flash memory brought on continued investment in new products and capacity in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
however  the second half of was marked by uncertain economic conditions that began to have a negative impact on capacity utilization and investment in capital equipment among our customers end users 
in  total sales to the non semiconductor capital equipment markets were relatively flat at million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in sales to customers in the flat panel display market increased to million  or of total sales in as compared to million  or of total sales in while revenue year over year was relatively flat  we experienced a large increase in demand in the early part of that was the continuation of an investment cycle that began in this investment for capacity expansion in both korea and the prc came online in the second half of the year and resulted in very low levels of investment during the remainder of the year 
in  sales to customers in the thin film renewables market decreased to million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales  in throughout  we saw strong demand for our crystalline silicon pv products in both europe and the prc 
additionally  the north american market grew in as larger megawatt output solar array projects resulted in an increase in the demand for thin film renewables 
in  global support revenue increased to million  or of total sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the increase in global support sales in was due to an increase in factory utilization by our customers throughout the year  which drove demand for repairs  replacement parts  and inventory restocking 
additionally  as factory utilization remained high  our customers looked to us to provide them with used and refurbished equipment to be used as spares for their fabrication lines 
applied materials inc  our largest customer  accounted for million or of our sales in  million  or of our sales in  and million  or  of our sales in our sales to applied materials included sales for the semiconductor capital equipment market  as well as the solar and flat panel display markets 
solar energy results for solar energy for the twelve months ended december    and are as follows in thousands years ended december  sales operating income solar energy sales increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in solar energy comprised of total sales in as compared to in large utility scale projects continue to drive the increase in sales for solar energy 
during we expanded our presence in canada resulting in significant growth in sales for that market 
as we continue to offer new products and provide high efficiency inverters to our customers we are gaining traction in the utility space resulting in several large project wins 
although we expect continued growth in solar energy in  we expect sales to be flat in the first quarter of solar energy sales increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in solar energy comprised of total sales in as compared to in sales in also included a full year of sales from pv powered which we acquired on may  the majority of our sales in the inverter market continued to come from commercial and utility scale applications 
the addition of pv powered s product portfolio expanded the range of power capacities in which we can compete 
gross profit our gross profit was million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in the decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales is due to the decline in sales in the thin films markets 
our thin films business unit has higher gross margins than our solar energy business unit  resulting in a decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales when thin films sales decline as a percentage of total sales 

table of contents gross profit was million  or of revenue in and million  or of revenue  in the increase in absolute dollars was due to the overall growth in production and sales in  a full year of sales from our acquisition of pv powered and increased leverage of factory overhead  as well as reduced warranty costs resulting from improved quality and lower warranty claims 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales was the result of a shift in the mix of products including a higher percentage of revenue from our solar energy product line  which traditionally has lower gross margins 
operating expense the following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended  and years ended december  in thousands research and development selling  general  and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses in response to significant declines in demand in many of the markets we serve  we initiated a plan in late to re align our business to be closer to our customers and improve our time to market 
these initiatives included headcount reductions  facilities closures  and asset impairments and are substantially complete as december  the reductions in headcount and facilities closures along with other reductions in spending resulted in reduced operating expenses in as compared to operating expenses increased in as compared to due to a full year of expenses related to the purchase of pv powered and increased spending in our production facilities in  which carried over into the first half of demand in the markets we serve declined significantly in the second half of as a result  we initiated the restructuring plan described above 
the first phase of these initiatives occurred late in the year  therefore the reductions in spending were not fully realized in but are expected to save approximately million annually 
the rapid increase in demand in in the markets we serve challenged our production capacity  as well as our ability to meet the tight deadlines of our customers 
as a result  we increased spending in our production facilities in order to meet our customers demands and take full advantage of the market opportunities presented to us in additionally  we added employees and operating expenses related to the acquisition of pv powered  as well as for the infrastructure necessary to expand our global presence to new markets throughout the world 
research and development the markets we serve constantly present opportunities to develop products for new or emerging applications and require technological changes driving for higher performance  lower cost  and other attributes that will advance our customers products 
we believe that continued and timely development of new and differentiated products  as well as enhancements to existing products to support customer requirements  are critical for us to compete in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we devote significant personnel and financial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and we expect these investments to continue 
all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  decreased million from the same period in the decrease is primarily the result of a full year of lower personnel expenses as a result of headcount reductions under our restructuring plan 
the strategic initiatives that began in late and were completed in involved consolidating facilities and engineer teams and activities to be closer to our customers 
the increase in research and development expenses of million in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily the result of a full year of engineering expenses for pv powered 
we continued to invest in product development in both the thin film and solar energy businesses to meet customer needs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  third party sales representative commissions  and other selling and marketing activities 
our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  tax  financial  governance  administrative  information systems  and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
selling general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to a significant reduction in bad debt expenses from coupled with recoveries of balances reserved in the prior year 
lower commissions due to lower sales  reductions in advertising and trade show expenses  and reductions in outside services also contributed to the decline in sg a spending 
sg a expenses increased million in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to a full year of expenses for employees added through the acquisition of pv powered combined with an increase in bad debt expense  which was partially offset by significantly lower incentive expenses in based on a decline in company performance in the second half of the year 
amortization expense amortization expense was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period ending december  and million for the same period ending december  the increase of million in is due primarily to amortization on in process research and development that was placed into service in the first quarter of also included in amortization for is a partial year of amortization on million of amortizable intangible assets acquired with the purchase of solvix 
see note intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on intangible assets and related future amortization 
restructuring charges in september  we announced several initiatives designed to realign our manufacturing and research and development activities in order to foster growth and enhance profitability 
these initiatives are designed to align research and development activities with the location of our customers and reduce product costs for the solar energy business 
since the start of this plan  we have reduced the global workforce by  consolidated our facilities by terminating or exiting several leases  and recorded impairments for assets no longer in use due to the restructuring of our business 
other income other income consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses  and other miscellaneous items 
interest income for the twelve month periods ending december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest rates have remained very low in resulting in interest income increasing only slightly due to higher cash balances in other income  net was million in  million in and million in the increase in other income  net in is due to the gain on the sale of fixed assets of million related to ending our contract manufacturing agreement with hml 
the decrease in as compared to was mainly due to million in net revenue recognized in from pv powered s participation in the solar energy grid integration system program sponsored by the department of energy 
the revenue related to this program declined in as the project in process was completed 
provision for income taxes we recorded a income tax provision of million  or an effective tax rate of 
the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates  a benefit from the federal alternative minimum tax credit  a domestic production activity benefit  offset by a net expense related to a change in the valuation allowance applicable to deferred tax assets 
we recorded a income tax provision of million  or an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates  a domestic production activity benefit  and the federal research and development tax credit 

table of contents we recorded a income tax provision of million  or an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates and the federal research and development tax credit 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  and the geographic composition of our pre tax income 
we carefully monitor these factors and adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly 
pursuant to the american taxpayer relief act of  the federal research and development credit has been reenacted retroactively to january  as the law implementing this change was signed on january   we expect to record a discrete tax benefit  attributable to the retroactive period  of approximately million during the first quarter of in addition  we expect the act extension of the federal research and development credit will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate by approximately percentage points as compared to discontinued operations on october   we completed the sale of our gas flow control business  which includes the aera mass flow control and related product lines to hitachi metals  ltd  for million 
assets and liabilities sold include  without limitation  inventory  real property in hachioji  japan  equipment  certain contracts  intellectual property rights related to the gas flow control business  and certain warranty liability obligations 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million gain on the asset disposition  net of million in taxes 
the results of continuing operations were reduced by the revenue and costs associated with the gas flow control business which are included in the income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  in our consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with the closing of this asset disposition  we entered into a master services agreement and a supplemental transition services agreement pursuant to which we provided certain transition services until october and we became an authorized service provider for hitachi in all countries other than japan 
as of may  we ceased providing contract manufacturing services to hitachi and completed the sale of certain fixed assets related to that manufacturing 
we do not anticipate any additional activity with hitachi in respect of these assets that would materially impact our financial statements in the future 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of component parts used in our manufacturing process 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales prices over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our ability to fund our operations  acquisitions  capital expenditures  and product development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities 
our operating activities are subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other conditions  some of which may be beyond our control 
our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash  investments  cash generated from current operations and availability under our credit facility as defined below 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
we believe that adequate liquidity and cash generation will be important to the execution of our strategic initiatives 
we believe that our current cash levels and our cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  anticipated levels of capital expenditures  and contractual obligations for the next twelve months 
on october   we entered into an agreement with wells fargo bank  national association which provides for a secured revolving credit facility credit facility of up to million 
borrowings under the credit facility are subject to a borrowing base based upon our accounts receivable and inventory and are available for various corporate purposes 
the credit facility provides us further flexibility for execution of our strategic plans including acquisitions 
for more information on the credit facility see note credit facility of our consolidated financial statements 
on october   we announced a million share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and risk management in the normal course of business  we have exposures to interest rate risk from our investments  credit facility  and foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 
interest rate risk our market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio and credit facility 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of treasury bills  certificates of deposit  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  agency bonds and institutional money markets  all with maturity of less than years 
as a measurement of the sensitivity of our portfolio and assuming that our investment portfolio balances remain constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in interest rates would decrease annual pre tax earnings by approximately million 
we had no debt outstanding as of december  our only debt instrument at december  was the credit facility  which would be subject to variable interest rates and principal payments should we decide to borrow against it 
however  assuming a full drawdown on the revolving credit facility  and holding other variables constant  a hypothetical immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would be expected to have an impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows of approximately million over the course of months 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates through sales and purchasing transactions when we sell products and purchase materials in currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred 
the functional currencies of our worldwide facilities primarily include the usd  eur  krw  twd  gbp  and cny 
our purchasing and sales activities are primarily denominated in the usd  eur and cny 
we may be impacted by changes in the relative buying power of our customers  which may impact sales volumes either positively or negatively 
as these currencies fluctuate against each other  and other currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on sales  purchasing transactions and labor 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange rate contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities expected to be settled at a future date 
market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative instruments that result from a change in foreign currency exchange rates 
in we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exchange rate risk associated with intercompany debt denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
we minimize our market risk applicable to foreign currency exchange rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of our derivative contract instruments 
we enter into derivative contract instruments for risk management purposes only 
we do not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
our reported financial results of operations  including the reported value of our assets and liabilities  are also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
assets and liabilities of substantially all of our subsidiaries outside the us are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period 
operating results and cash flow statements are translated at weighted average rates of exchange during each reporting period 
although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact  the translation changes may impact future borrowing capacity  and overall value of our net assets 
currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the usd while another currency weakens 
because of the complex interrelationship of the worldwide supply chains and distribution channels  it is difficult to quantify the impact of a change in one or more particular exchange rates
