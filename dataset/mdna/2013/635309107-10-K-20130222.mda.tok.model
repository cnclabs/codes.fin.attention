known trends and uncertainties the current macro economic environment and its impact on the national television scatter advertising market in general  present uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  including the timing and amount of spending from our national advertising clients 
the impact to our business associated with these issues will be mitigated somewhat over time due to factors including the growth in our advertising client base  the effectiveness of cinema advertising relative to other advertising mediums  the effectiveness and increasing scale of our national network and the related increase in salable advertising impressions and fathom live broadcast locations 
during  we added several new affiliate theatres to our national network including cinema supply  incorporated  dickinson theatres  inc  far away entertainment  king theatres circuit llc  star cinema grill  texas cinemas  corp  o neil entertainment group  united entertainment corp  fairchild cinemas  inc  loeks theatres  inc

our sales force integrates these additional impressions into the advertising sales process as they are added to our network and thus these attendees will provide the opportunity 
table of contents to expand our revenue  operating income and cash flow in and beyond 
we believe that the continued growth of our network will expand our national reach and geographic coverage to strengthen our selling proposition and competitive positioning versus other national and regional advertising platforms 
under the esas  up to seconds of the firstlook program can be sold to ncm llc s founding members to satisfy their on screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements 
during and in  we sold seconds to ncm llc s founding members 
we expect to continue to sell seconds of time to ncm llc s founding members in in consideration for ncm llc s access to ncm llc s founding members theatre attendees for on screen advertising and use of off screen locations within ncm llc s founding members theatres for the len and lobby promotions  ncm llc s founding members receive a monthly theatre access fee under the esas

the payment per theatre patron increases by every five years  with the first such increase taking effect in  and the payment per digital screen increases annually by 
the theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to all ncm llc founding members cannot be less than of ncm llc s aggregate advertising revenue as defined in the esa  or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment 
pursuant to esa amendments  beginning on october  the theatre access fee paid to the members of ncm llc included an additional fee for access to the higher quality digital cinema systems for our advertising and fathom business  this additional fee increased in and will continue to increase in as additional screens are equipped with the new digital cinema equipment and the fee increases annually by 
as of december   of our network screens were showing advertising on digital cinema projectors versus as of december  during the first quarter of  the company restructured fathom events by winding down its fathom business events division  to place more focus on the fathom consumer events division

these transactions are described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these transactions we have extended the average maturities of our debt by years to years as of december  and our cash interest expense on borrowings is projected to decrease approximately million for compared to  before the amortization of other comprehensive income oci 
as discussed in notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document  ncm llc s fiscal year and tax returns are currently under examination by the irs and in september  ncm llc received a notice of proposed adjustment nopa for the calendar year examination primarily related to characterization of the cash received by ncm llc s founding members at or around the date of the company s ipo 
as ncm llc is a pass through entity for federal income tax purposes  there will be no direct impact to the financial statements of ncm llc 
however  there could be an impact to the financial statements of ncm  inc the impact of any adjustment could result in ncm  inc recognizing its proportionate share of the changes in the tax basis in ncm llc 
this could result in a net increase in deferred tax assets and equity of ncm  inc ncm  inc  in its capacity as tax matters partner for ncm llc  received a day letter from the irs  dated april   in connection with the examination of ncm llc s federal tax return for the and fiscal years 
the day letter notified ncm llc that the irs intended to adjust partnership items unless a written letter of protest was received by the irs within days of the date of the letter 
subsequent to the receipt of the day letter  ncm  inc received from the irs an additional day extension to respond 
the adjustments proposed by the irs in the day letter are materially similar to the adjustments proposed in the 
table of contents nopa received in september the company submitted its written letter of protest to the irs in july and believes the irs position lacks merit and is disputing the adjustments through the administrative appeals process 
in december  ncm llc was notified by the irs that its case had formally been transferred from examination to administrative appeals 
there has not been a formal appeals conference scheduled as of february  it is reasonably possible that  should the irs prevail  the company may be required to pay additional amounts to ncm llc s founding members under the tax receivable agreement which would be offset by refunds from various state and federal taxing authorities thus it would not have a material adverse impact on our cash flow or financial condition 
however  at this time the amount of any such payments to ncm llc s founding members or refunds from the various taxing authorities cannot be reasonably estimated 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december   december  and december  was  and  respectively 
our tax rate is affected by recurring items and the relative amount of income that ncm  inc earns in various state and local jurisdictions 
our tax rate is also impacted by discrete items that may occur in any year 
the increase in tax rate for the year ended december  is primarily due an adjustment to the measurement of our long term payable to our founding member liability s expected net realized tax benefit which included approximately million attributable to prior periods 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
our net income and earnings per share could fluctuate significantly with interest rate fluctuations related to our borrowings

ncm llc can also make payments pursuant to the tax receivable agreement in the amount  and at the time necessary to satisfy the contractual obligations with respect to the actual cash tax benefits payable to ncm llc s founding members 
as of december   the ncm llc s consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio was times versus the covenant of times 
critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in its trade receivables  which represent a significant asset on the balance sheet 
estimating the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses based on historical loss experience  consideration of current economic trends and conditions and debtor specific factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
account receivable balances are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged are credited to the allowance 
a provision for bad debt is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for bad debt could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
share based compensation 
the company s equity incentive plan is treated as an equity plan under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc compensation stock compensation  and the determination of fair value of options and non vested stock for accounting purposes requires that management make complex estimates and judgments 

table of contents we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our options 
this model requires that the company make estimates of various factors used 
the following assumptions were used in the valuation of the options expected life of options the expected life of the options is determined by using the average of the vesting and contractual terms of the options 
due to the length of time over which our options have been outstanding  the company has not developed a historical option exercise experience and has determined that the simplified method is a reasonable basis to estimate the expected life of the options 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is determined by using the applicable treasury rates as of the grant dates  commensurate with the expected terms of the options 
expected volatility ncm closed its ipo on february  since the length of time our shares have been publicly traded is shorter than the contractual terms of our options  we believe historical volatility may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
as a result  we derive a weighted expected volatility based on comparable companies as well as on our historical volatility 
dividend yield the estimated dividend yield was determined using management s expectations based on estimated cash flow characteristics and expected long term dividend policy 
forfeiture rate our forfeiture rate is based on management s expectations of potential separation of employees 
certain of the non vested stock awards include performance vesting conditions  which permit vesting to the extent that the company achieves specified non gaap targets at the end of the measurement period 
compensation expense is based on management s projections and the probability of achievement of those expectations  which requires considerable judgment 
we record a cumulative adjustment to share based compensation expense in periods that we change our estimate of the number of shares expected to vest 
additionally  we ultimately adjust the expense recognized to reflect the actual vested shares following the resolution of the performance conditions 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax amounts are determined using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under currently enacted tax law 
valuation allowances are to be established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we currently have a million valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize such assets in future periods as we do not expect offsetting capital gains 
in addition  due to the basis differences resulting from our ipo related transactions including the tax receivable agreement with ncm llc s founding members and subsequent adjustments pursuant to the common unit adjustment agreement  we are required to make cash payments under the tax receivable agreement to ncm llc s founding members in amounts equal to of our actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the basis difference for certain deferred assets noted above 
the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  as amended  are highly technical and complex and involve management s judgment  including judgments to determine hypothetical tax outcomes exclusive of the ipo date transaction and agreements 
if we were to fail to meet certain of the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  we could be subject to additional payments to taxing authorities or to ncm llc s founding members 
refer to note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
ncm llc s calendar years and tax returns are currently under examination by tax authorities

table of contents the value in this table represents the maximum potential payout under the revenue guarantees made by ncm llc to its network affiliates 
no revenue guarantee amounts have ever been paid under these agreements as such guarantees have been less than the revenue share calculations specified in the affiliate agreements  and no liabilities were recorded as of december  for additional details see the information provided under note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the tax receivable agreement entered into at the completion of our ipo provides for the payment by us to ncm llc s founding members of of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of certain increases in our proportionate share of tax basis in ncm llc s tangible and intangible assets 
the payments to ncm llc s founding members are based  in part  on actual annual income and as such  will vary based on our operating results 
the value in the table represents the estimated amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement as of december  the tax receivable agreement described in note above was discounted and recorded at present value 
the value in the table represents the estimated accretion of interest on the discounted payable as of december  the amended and restated esas entered into at the completion of our ipo require payments based on a combination of ncm llc founding member attendance and the number of digital screens of each ncm llc founding member 
the amount relating to the attendance factor will vary from quarter to quarter and year to year as theatre attendance varies  while the amount relating to the screens factor will be more predictable  but will also vary quarter to quarter and year to year as screens are converted to digital screens and other screens are added or removed through acquisition  divestiture or closure activities of ncm llc s founding members 
the payments made to ncm llc s founding members also will vary due to the escalation of the rates paid for each factor pursuant to the amended and restated esas 
the rate per attendee increases every five years while the rate per digital screen increases annually 
the table above does not include amounts payable under the amended and restated esas as they are based on variable factors  which are not capable of precise estimation 
seasonality our revenue and operating results are seasonal in nature  coinciding with the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients and to a lesser extent the attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry as well as the timing and the number of fathom events 
both advertising expenditures and theatre attendance tend to be higher during the second  third  and fourth fiscal quarters 
advertising revenue is primarily correlated with new product releases  advertising client marketing priorities and economic cycles and to a lesser extent theatre attendance levels 
the actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending on these factors or other risks and uncertainties 
based on our historical experience  our first quarter typically has less revenue than the other quarters of a given year due primarily to lower advertising client demand and lower theatre industry attendance levels 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future 
the following table reflects the quarterly percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years ended   and first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fy fy fy fy item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
the senior unsecured notes and the senior secured notes bear interest at fixed rates  and therefore are not subject to market risk 
as of december   the interest rate risk that we are exposed to is related to our million revolving credit facility and our 
table of contents million term loan 
a basis point fluctuation in market interest rates underlying our term loan and revolving credit facility would have the effect of increasing or decreasing our cash interest expense by approximately million for an annual period on the million and million outstanding as of december  on our revolving credit facility and term loan  respectively
