item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on transforming medicines that can transform lives 
we operate a business model that focuses on the following developing innovative products that address unmet medical needs in the marketplace  obtaining patents for those innovative ideas which we believe have value in the marketplace  utilizing a small group of talented employees to develop those ideas by working with strategic outsource partners  developing a regulatory pathway with the appropriate agency  and determining how best to commercialize our products 

table of contents we hire experts with strong project management skills in the specific disciplines we believe are important to maintain within our company 
we contract with and manage strong outsource partners as we complete the necessary development work  permitting us to avoid incurring the cost of buying or building laboratories  manufacturing facilities or clinical research operation sites 
this allows us to control our annual expenses  but to utilize best in class resources as required 
we have decided to retain ownership of our pa product candidates for cardiovascular indications which contain a combination of a proton pump inhibitor and enteric coated aspirin in a single tablet through the clinical development and pre commercialization stage and our chief commercial officer is responsible for developing the commercialization strategy for these products and conducting all the required pre commercialization activities 
our commercialization strategy for pa in the united states is to find a commercial partner who shares our vision for commercialization of the products 
outside the united states is to secure relationships with one or more strong commercial partners with relevant expertise to commercialize our future products globally 
we have retained keelin reeds llc to assist us in the strategic partner search for pa and pa for both the us and globally 
keelin reeds is a global expert in helping life sciences companies value pipeline assets  develop business development strategies and execute partnership transactions 
with respect to future products we may develop  we intend to continue our historical business model in which the company funded development activities for pipeline products through proof of concept and license the product prior to initiating phase clinical trials 
the success of our business is highly dependent on the marketplace value of our ideas and the related patents we obtain  our ability to obtain from the required regulatory agencies approval to sell the developed products and our ability to find strong commercial partners to successfully commercialize the products 
we have previously developed treximet in collaboration with glaxosmithkline  or gsk 
treximet is the brand name for the product combining sumatriptan mg  formulated with rt technology and naproxen sodium mg in a single tablet designed for the acute treatment of migraine 
on april   the us food and drug administration  or fda  approved treximet for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 
upon receipt of fda approval  gsk notified us of its intention to launch the product and treximet was available in pharmacies in may on november   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement  or the purchase agreement  with cppib credit investments inc or cii  pursuant to which we sold  and cii purchased  our right to receive future royalty payments arising from us sales of mt  including treximet 
under the purchase agreement  we received million and will receive a twenty percent interest in any royalties received by cii relating to the period commencing on april  under the purchase agreement  cii has assumed financial responsibility for and will receive the proceeds  if any  from our patent litigation concerning treximet against par  alphapharm  and dr 
reddy s and our patent litigation against sun pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
we have developed vimovo with astrazeneca ab  or astrazeneca 
vimovo formerly referred to as pn is the brand name for a proprietary fixed dose combination of the ppi esomeprazole magnesium with the nsaid naproxen in a single tablet 
on april   the fda approved vimovo for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis  or oa  rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  and ankylosing spondylitis  or as  and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
in august  we entered into an exclusive global collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca to co develop and commercialize vimovo  which agreement was amended in september and october we began the phase program in september as part of the program  we conducted two phase pivotal trials of vimovo in patients who are at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers  the primary endpoint for which was the reduction in endoscopic gastric ulcers 
the nda for vimovo was submitted on june  and was accepted for filing by fda in august pozen received a million milestone payment from astrazeneca in september for the achievement of such milestone 
earlier  in may  we had received a million milestone payment when we received fda approval of vimovo 
in october  astrazeneca submitted a marketing authorization application  or maa  for vimovo in the european union  or eu  via the decentralized procedure  or dcp  and has filed or plans to file for approval in a number of other countries which are not covered by the dcp 
on october   we announced with astrazeneca that vimovo had received positive agreement for approval in countries across the eu following all concerned member states agreeing with the assessment of the netherlands health authority meb  acting as the reference member state for the dcp 
we received a million milestone payment when pricing and reimbursement for vimovo was granted in the united kingdom 
other member states and countries worldwide are now pursuing pricing and reimbursement and national approvals 

table of contents our pa product candidates  containing a ppi and aspirin have completed clinical development testing in the united states 
our pa product candidates are excluded from our agreement with astrazeneca 
we have met with the fda to discuss the overall development program requirements for pa for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in patients at risk for gastric ulcers 
an investigational new drug application  or ind  was filed in the fourth quarter of we have completed a study which demonstrated that the sa component of pa was bioequivalent to the reference drug  ec aspirin 
we filed a special protocol assessment  or spa  with the fda for the design of the phase studies for the product  the primary endpoint for which is the reduction in the cumulative incidence of endoscopic gastric ulcers 
based upon the fda s earlier confirmation that endoscopic gastric ulcers were an acceptable primary endpoint  in october  we began two pivotal phase and one long term safety study for pa for the cardiovascular indication 
the primary endpoint of the pivotal studies  which included approximately subjects per study  was a significant reduction in the cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers following administration of pa vs 
mg enteric coated aspirin over the six month treatment period 
the primary endpoint was met in both studies 
additionally  the studies met their key secondary endpoints  including a reduction in gastroduodenal ulceration as well as a reduction in discontinuation due to upper gastrointestinal adverse events in subjects taking pa compared to mg enteric coated aspirin 
in february  the fda requested an additional phase study to assess the bioequivalence of pa to ec aspirin mg with respect to acetylsalicylic acid  or asa 
after the company completed the requested bioequivalence study  the fda has made a preliminary review of the study results and the company s summary analyses and  based on its preliminary assessment of the information available to it at the time  the fda did not agree that bioequivalence of pa to ec aspirin mg was demonstrated 
the company then submitted to the fda additional information and analyses from the requested bioequivalence study  as well as other relevant pharmacokinetic  clinical pharmacology  and in vitro dissolution data as a briefing document in support of a request for a type a meeting with the fda 
at the type a meeting held in august  the fda confirmed that  although it believes bioequivalence of pa to ec aspirin mg  was not strictly established in our bioequivalence study according to the predetermined criteria  the results from this study  together with additional information that will be submitted by the company in the nda  constitutes sufficient data to support the establishment of a clinical and pharmacological bridge between the product and ec aspirin mg 
the fda indicated that it will make a final determination during the nda review 
the fda also indicated that a similar strategy to bridge to the reference listed drug  inclusive of a new  single pharmacokinetic study  could be utilized for a low dose version of pa currently pa 
the company conducted this study with the low dose version against the ec aspirin mg 
based on the predetermined criteria acceptable to the fda  the study demonstrated that pa is bioequivalent to ec aspirin mg using criteria for highly variable drugs and had comparable bioavailability 
during a pre submission meeting with respect to its nda for pa in april  the fda suggested that the company also seek approval for a lower dose formulation of the product containing mg of enteric coated aspirin as part of its nda for pa absent the availability of such a lower dose formulation in the market if pa is approved  the fda indicated that it may limit the indication for pa to use in post coronary artery bypass graft surgery cabg with treatment duration not to exceed one year 
during the type a meeting held in august  the fda confirmed its preference to have both pa and a lower dose version available in the market so that physicians can have both a low and high dose option available  and agreed that  if both dosage strengths were included in the nda and subsequently approved  the indications for both will be consistent with the full range of indications described in the current aspirin monograph 
we have generated some clinical pharmacology data and chemical  manufacturing and controls cmc data for a product which contains mg of enteric coated aspirin and mg of omeprazole in a single tablet known as pa the company intends to file this existing data  together with additional cmc data to be generated and evidence from the scientific literature relating to the ulcerogenic risk of mg of aspirin with the fda and is assessing various submission strategies 
at this time  we do not intend to conduct phase clinical trials for pa we anticipate that the data package submitted for pa will be similar to that used to gain approval for a lower dosage form of vimovo containing mg of naproxen 
we have no assurance such data will be sufficient for the fda to approve pa or to allow a broader indication for pa the fda will make a final determination with respect to the approvability of and indications for pa and pa generation of additional data with respect to pa and incorporation of data into the nda for pa delayed submission of the nda from the original planned submission date in the third quarter of we currently anticipate filing the nda for both products in the first half of 
table of contents we have incurred significant losses since our inception and have not yet generated significant revenue from product sales 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we record revenue under the following categories royalty revenues  licensing revenues and development revenues 
our licensing revenues include upfront payments upon contract signing  additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development or commercialization are reached  while the royalty payments are based on product sales 
additionally  our development revenues include the billings for the direct costs and certain personnel related time incurred in performing additional development activities described under our collaboration agreements 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for our product candidates and sales  general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for personnel involved in our research and development activities and direct development costs  which include costs relating to the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates  costs relating to preclinical studies  including toxicology studies  and clinical trials  and costs relating to compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to the development of our product candidates 
since inception  our research and development expenses have represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
for the fiscal year ended december   our research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
operating losses may be incurred over the next several years as we complete the development and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates  develop other product candidates  conduct pre commercialization activities  and acquire and or develop product portfolios in other therapeutic areas 
our results may vary depending on many factors  including the progress of our pa product candidates and our other product candidates in the clinical and regulatory process  the ability of astrazeneca to successfully commercialize vimovo globally  the establishment of new collaborations and progress and or maintenance of our existing collaborations for the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates  our ability to successfully defend our regulatory market exclusivity and patent rights against generic challenges and to succeed in obtaining extensions of such exclusivity for which we may be eligible  our ability to commercialize our products with commercial partners in a highly regulated and extremely competitive marketplace  the possible acquisition and or in licensing  and development of our therapeutic product candidates 
we do not currently have internal commercialization or manufacturing capabilities 
we have entered into collaborations and may continue to enter into additional collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates once approved 
we have decided to retain control of our pa product candidates for cardiovascular indications through the clinical development and pre commercialization stage 
to that end  our chief commercial officer is evaluating the commercial opportunities for these product candidates and has developed a worldwide commercial strategy  which enable us to conduct pre commercialization activities prior to licensing these products to commercial partners 
our ability to generate revenue in the near term is dependent upon our ability  alone or with collaborators  to achieve the milestones set forth in our collaboration agreements  to enter into additional collaboration agreements  to successfully develop product candidates  to obtain regulatory approvals and to successfully manufacture and commercialize our future products 
these milestones are earned when we have satisfied the criteria set out in our revenue recognition footnote accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these payments generate large non recurring revenue that will cause large fluctuations in quarterly and annual profit and loss 
status and expenses related to our products and product candidates there follows a brief discussion of the status of the development of our approved products and our product candidates  as well as the costs relating to our development activities 
our direct research and development expenses were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  our research and development expenses that are not direct development costs consist of personnel and other research and development departmental costs and are not allocated by product candidate 
we generally do not maintain records that allocate our employees time by the projects on which they work and  therefore  are unable to identify costs related to the time that employees spend on research and development by product candidate 
total compensation and benefit costs for our personnel involved in research and development were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  total compensation included million  million and million charge for non cash compensation for stock option expense for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
other research and development department costs were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  respectively 

table of contents treximet 
on april   the fda approved treximet for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 
gsk notified us of its intention to launch the product and treximet was available in pharmacies in may as part of our nda program for treximet  we conducted five phase trials  two phase pivotal trials  and one month open label safety trial using a formulation of treximet developed by gsk 
the phase pivotal trials  including the endpoints required to evaluate treximet  were designed to demonstrate superiority to placebo for relief of pain and the associated symptoms of migraine nausea  photophobia and phonophobia at two hours 
additionally  the program was designed to demonstrate that each component makes a contribution to the efficacy of treximet the combination drug rule that the fda requires of all combination products 
the efficacy endpoint for the combination was sustained pain free  which is defined as improvement from moderate or severe pain to no pain at two hours and remaining at no pain through twenty four hours without the use of rescue medicine 
further  gsk has conducted market support studies for treximet  including evaluations in a pediatric population 
as required by the terms of our agreement with gsk  we transferred ownership of the nda and other regulatory filings for treximet to gsk on may   and gsk now has responsibility for all ongoing regulatory obligations for the product  including post marketing clinical trial requirements 
we incurred total direct development costs of million associated with the development of our mt and treximet programs 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
on november   we entered into the purchase agreement with cii  pursuant to which we sold  and cii purchased  our right to receive future royalty payments arising from us sales of mt  including treximet

pn vimovo program 
under our pn program  we completed formulation development and clinical studies for several combinations of a ppi and a nsaid in a single tablet intended to provide effective management of pain and inflammation associated with chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis  and intended to have fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to a nsaid taken alone in patients at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
we initially conducted studies with two pn product formulations in this program pn  a combination of the ppi lansoprazole and the nsaid naproxen  and pn  a combination of the ppi omeprazole and naproxen  prior to entering into our collaboration with astrazeneca 
our present development and commercialization efforts under the pn program are covered under our exclusive collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  which we entered into on august  and which was amended in september and october our agreement with astrazeneca covers the development and commercialization of proprietary fixed dose combinations of the ppi esomeprazole magnesium with the nsaid naproxen in a single tablet 
the initial product developed under the agreement  vimovo formerly pn  was approved by the fda on april  for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis  rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 

table of contents in discussions with the fda during regarding our development plans for studies to pursue fda approval of pn and pn  the fda agreed that by including naproxen as the nsaid within the pn formulation  we could expect that all indications for chronic use of naproxen in adults would accrue to the pn product  if clinical trials successfully demonstrated improved safety lower incidence of gastric ulcers of the pn product compared with naproxen alone and the pn formulation was shown to be bioequivalent to marketed formulations of enteric coated  or ec  naproxen 
prior to entering into our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  we completed a study designed to demonstrate the bioequivalence of the naproxen component of our pn product candidate development formulation to ec naproxen 
this study demonstrated that the pn product was bioequivalent to the reference drug  ec naprosyn  with respect to the naproxen component 
the nda for vimovo was submitted on june  and was accepted for filing in august we received a million milestone payment from astrazeneca in september for the achievement of such milestone 
on april   vimovo was approved by fda for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis  rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
we received a million milestone payment from astrazeneca in may in connection with such approval 
as required by the terms of our agreement with astrazeneca  we transferred ownership of the nda and other regulatory filings for vimovo to astrazeneca on june   and astrazeneca now has responsibility for all ongoing regulatory obligations for the product in the us  including post marketing clinical trial requirements  in addition to responsibility for all regulatory obligations outside the us additionally  we met with four national european regulatory agencies to discuss the proposed development program for pn 
under our agreement with astrazeneca  astrazeneca has responsibility for the development program for pn products outside the us  including interactions with regulatory agencies 
in october  astrazeneca submitted a maa for vimovo in the eu via the dcp and has filed and plans to file for approval in a number of other countries which are not covered by the dcp 
on october   we announced with astrazeneca that vimovo had received positive agreement for approval in countries across the eu following all concerned member states agreeing with the assessment of the netherlands health authority  acting as the reference member state for the dcp 
we received a million milestone payment when pricing and reimbursement for vimovo was granted in the united kingdom 
other member states are now pursuing pricing and reimbursement and national approvals 
earlier  in may  we had received a million milestone payment when we received fda approval of vimovo 
as of the end september  vimovo has been filed for regulatory approval in countries  approved in countries and commercially launched in countries 
we incurred total direct development cost of million associated with the development of our pn program of which million was funded by development revenue from astrazeneca 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expense 
pa program 
as part of our pa program  we are exploring the development of a ppi and aspirin in a single tablet 
similar to the pn program  our pa product candidate is intended to induce fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an aspirin taken alone in patients at risk for developing aspirin associated gastric ulcers 
our pa product candidates are covered under the same patent as pn  but we have retained all rights to this program through the clinical development and pre commercialization stage 
our initial pa product candidate  pa  is currently in clinical development 
we completed a phase proof of concept study in canada of an earlier formulation of pa containing mg of aspirin and mg of omeprazole pa in the first quarter of based upon the fda s earlier confirmation that endoscopic gastric ulcers were an acceptable primary endpoint  in october  we began two pivotal phase and one long term safety study for pa for the cardiovascular indication 
the primary endpoint was met in both studies 
additionally  the studies met their key secondary endpoints  including a reduction in gastroduodenal ulceration as well as a reduction in discontinuation due to upper gastrointestinal adverse events in subjects taking pa compared to mg enteric coated aspirin 
in february  the fda requested an additional phase study to assess the bioequivalence of pa to ec aspirin mg with respect to acetylsalicylic acid  or asa

the fda indicated that it will make a final determination during the nda review 
based on these discussions with the fda  we do not plan to conduct any further bioequivalence studies with pa fda also indicated that a similar strategy to bridge to the reference listed drug  inclusive of a new  single pharmacokinetic study  could be utilized for a low dose version of pa pa 
we have conducted this study with the low dose version against the ec aspirin mg 
based on the predetermined criteria acceptable to the fda  the study demonstrated that pa is bioequivalent to ec aspirin using criteria for highly variable drugs and had comparable bioavailability 

table of contents during a pre submission meeting with respect to its nda for pa in april  the fda suggested that the company also seek approval for a lower dose formulation of the product containing mg of enteric coated aspirin as part of its nda for pa we intended to seek an indication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients at risk for gastric ulcers 
during the type a meeting held in august  the fda has confirmed its preference to have both pa and a lower dose version available in the market so that physicians can have both a low and high dose option available  and agreed that  if both dosage strengths were included in the nda and subsequently approved  the indications for both will be consistent with the full range of indications described in the current aspirin monograph

generation of additional data with respect to pa and incorporation of data into the nda for pa will delay submission of the nda from the original planned submission date in the third quarter of we currently anticipate filing the nda for both products in the first half of as part of our ongoing evaluation of the commercial opportunities for these product candidates  we may also conduct formulation development and early stage clinical studies with other pa product candidates for indications in addition to secondary prevention of cardiovascular events 
we are evaluating the regulatory requirements to obtain an indication for pa for the secondary prevention of colorectal neoplasia 
in january  we received input from fda with respect to the development requirements for a possible indication in colorectal neoplasia 
further discussions are being considered 
we are also evaluating the possibility of developing another dosage strength of pa for the treatment of osteoarthritis and similar conditions and met with the fda in december to obtain input with respect to the regulatory requirements to obtain such an indication 
in addition  we continue to evaluate the commercial potential of such a product 
we may to conduct further studies for these and other pa indications when adequate funds are available 
additionally  we have met with several regulatory agencies to discuss the proposed development program for pa 
each of these regulatory agencies has indicated that reduction in gastric ulcers is an appropriate endpoint for the pivotal trials 
seventy five to one hundred mg of aspirin was recommended for the cardiovascular dose of pa to take into phase trials in europe 
recently  we received scientific advice from the meb in the netherlands  which has agreed to be the reference member state in a decentralized filing procedure  regarding the development program required for the approval in the eu of pa tablets  including a lower dosage form containing mg of aspirin and mg of omeprazole pa for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease 
the meb agreed that a full phase clinical development program for pa  to demonstrate the reduction of endoscopic gastric ulcers vs 
ec aspirin  would not be necessary 
instead  a phase pharmacodynamic study comparing gastric ph control for pa vs 
ec omeprazole mg  along with a study to demonstrate bioequivalence of pa to a currently marketed ec aspirin product using asa as the analyte  would be sufficient 
the meb also agreed that the mg immediate release formulation is the appropriate dose for pa tablets as it provides similar hour gastric ph control to the mg ec formulation  and represents the lowest effective approved omeprazole dose for long term use to protect against the upper gastrointestinal ugi insult from chronic  once a day  low dose aspirin administration 
with regard to pa  given that mg ec aspirin dose is not currently marketed in europe or the netherlands  the meb will seek justification from the company for the use of mg in the treatment of secondary cv prevention 
however  doses in this range are currently approved for the short term treatment of patients following a cardiovascular event 

table of contents we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any pa product candidates we may seek to develop or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from any pa products 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
we have refined our strategy and decided to retain control of our pa product candidates for cardiovascular indications through the clinical development and pre commercialization stage and then seek strong commercial partners to maximize the potential of these product candidates 
we believe value is added to the pa product candidates as progress is made through clinical development and  if we partner the products after completion of the development program or after approval  either outside the united states or on a global basis  we believe it would be under economic terms more favorable to us than if we had licensed the product candidates at an earlier stage in development 
we incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our pa program of million during the fiscal year ended december  we incurred total direct development cost of million associated with the development of our pa program 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the us in the preparation of our financial statements 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure about these policies  have been reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we have critical accounting estimates in the following policy areas revenue recognition  accrued expenses  stock based compensation  fair value measurements and income taxes 
revenue recognition the company records revenue under the following categories royalty revenues  licensing revenues and development revenues 
licensing revenue for the years ended december    and consisted of the following royalty revenue and other licensing revenue for the year ended december  sale of royalty right  net of costs royalty revenue other licensing revenue total licensing revenue with regard to the licensing revenues  the company s licensing agreements have terms that include upfront payments upon contract signing and additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development or commercialization are reached 
when evaluating license agreements with multiple element deliverables  the company considers whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
this evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
in determining the units of accounting  management evaluates certain criteria  including whether the deliverables have standalone value  based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
at the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments  the company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone 
if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable  such milestone payments are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones 

table of contents on may   we announced that we entered into a license agreement with desitin arzneimittel gmbh  or desitin  for the development and commercialization of mt for the countries of the european union  as well as switzerland and norway 
on february   we received written notice from desitin that it was terminating the license agreement 
there is no dispute among the parties  and we have been advised that reimbursement uncertainty was the basis for desitin s decision to terminate the agreement 
the agreement will terminate  in accordance with its terms  ninety days from our receipt of desitin s notice of termination 
under the terms of the agreement  desitin was the exclusive licensee for mt in the licensed territory and was responsible for the remaining clinical development  manufacturing  and commercialization of mt desitin made an initial upfront payment of million to the company  to was be followed by milestone payments related to the development and launch of mt in certain specified countries 
the pre commercialization payments including the initial upfront payment totaled million 
the agreement would have expired on a country by country basis upon the th anniversary of the first commercial sale of mt in each country  unless terminated earlier 
desitin would have paid a double digit royalty on net sales of mt that increased based on annual sales volume 
in reviewing the terms of the executed agreement and considering the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb  accounting standards codification asc   multiple element arrangements  we concluded that our involvement in the collaboration is limited to specific information transfers in connection with the license which were completed during the same quarter the agreement was entered into 
we believe that future participation in the collaboration represents a right and a governance role only  rather than a substantive performance obligation 
the company s future participation in a steering committee established by the agreement will be to monitor the partner s development program progress and to ensure the partner s compliance under the agreement 
the company has no obligation to conduct any development activities for the product licensed to desitin 
as such  the company has determined the license is the only deliverable in the arrangement 
since the license was delivered in the second quarter  the initial upfront payment of million was recognized 
there were no development revenues received during the fiscal years ended december  and with regard to royalty revenues  royalty revenue from treximet sumatriptan naproxen sodium and vimovo naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed release tablets is recognized when earned  as will any other future royalty revenues with respect to the manufacture  sale or use of the company s products or technology 
for treximet and vimovo or those future arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  the company recognizes revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and reflects in future revenue any differences between the estimated and actual royalties 
these estimates are based upon information reported to us by our collaboration partners 
during the fiscal year ended december   the company recognized million for vimovo royalty revenue 
during the fiscal year ended december   the company recognized royalty revenue of million for vimovo  and million for treximet prior to the sale of royalty described below 
on november   the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement  or the purchase agreement  with cppib credit investments inc  or cii  pursuant to which we sold  and cii purchased  our right to receive future royalty payments arising from us sales of mt  including treximet 
under the purchase agreement  the company received million in november and will receive a twenty percent interest in any royalties received by cii relating to the period commencing on april  development revenue and direct billed costs for the years ended december   and were the following year ended december  development revenue direct costs accrued expenses  including contracted costs significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with accrued expenses  including those related to contract costs  such as costs associated with clinical trials 
specifically  the company must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet paid for or not yet invoiced in relation to contracted  external costs 
the company analyzes the progress of product development  clinical trial and related activities  invoices received  amounts paid  and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 

table of contents the company believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate accrued expenses for the period are appropriate 
however  determining the date on which certain contract services commence  the extent of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such  paid and unpaid  involves subjective judgments and estimates and often must be based upon information provided by third parties 
in the event that management does not identify certain contract costs which have begun to be incurred or under or over estimates the extent of services performed or the costs of such services  management adjusts costs during the period in which the information becomes available 
accrued costs related to product development and operating activities  including clinical trials  based upon the progress of these activities covered by the related contracts  invoices received and estimated costs totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december  the variance  at each of these ending periods  between the actual expenses incurred and the estimated expenses accrued was not material or significant 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we use the black scholes model to value service condition and performance condition option awards 
for awards with only service conditions and graded vesting features  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance conditions granted we recognize compensation cost over the expected period to achieve the performance conditions  provided achievement of the performance conditions are deemed probable 
determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected terms 
our expected volatility rate was estimated based on an equal weighting of the historical volatility of our common stock over a six year period 
the expected term we use was estimated based on average historical terms to exercise 
the risk free interest rate is based on seven year us treasury securities 
the pre vesting forfeiture rate used for the year ended december  was based on actual historical rates 
determining the appropriate amount to expense for performance based awards based on the achievement of stated goals requires judgment  including forecasting future performance results 
the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revisions is reflected in the period of change 
if any applicable financial performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
fair value measurement fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value hierarchy for inputs maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect a company judgment concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances 
the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the company is able to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar  or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
the financial assets for which we perform recurring measurements are cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   financial assets utilizing level inputs included cash equivalents 
financial assets utilizing level inputs included short term investments in government agency obligations and corporate fixed income securities 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 

table of contents our level valuations are based on the market approach and consist primarily of quoted prices for identical items on active securities exchanges 
our level valuations also use the market approach and are based on significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for financial instruments not traded on a daily basis 
we did not rely on level input for valuation of our securities at december  the following table sets forth our financial instruments carried at fair value as of december  and december  financial instruments carried at fair value december  december  assets cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and investments the following table sets forth our financial instruments carried at fair value within the fair value hierarchy and using the lowest level of input as of december  financial instruments carried at fair value quoted prices significant other significant in active markets observable unobservable for identical items inputs inputs level level level total assets cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and investments in determining whether a decline in fair value below the original cost is other than temporary  we use a systematic methodology that considers all available evidence  including the credit rating of the relevant trust  the parity score a measure of the trust ability to meet its obligations as they come due  general market conditions  and industry and sector performance  among other factors 
we also consider the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment until recovery or  if necessary  to the instrument maturity 
when determining whether an impairment is other than temporary we also consider the following information i if the market value of the investment is below its current carrying value for an extended period  which we generally define as nine to twelve months  ii if the issuer has experienced significant financial declines  or iii if the issuer has experienced significant changes in its credit quality  among other factors 
the company did not have any other than temporary impairments during the periods presented

income taxes have been accounted for using the liability method in accordance with fasb asc since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and may incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the utilization of these loss carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on the company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
in addition  the maximum annual use of net operating loss and research credit carryforwards is limited in certain situations where changes occur in stock ownership 
we currently file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and the state of north carolina 
we are no longer subject to federal or north carolina income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before however  the loss carryforwards generated prior to may still be subject to change  if we subsequently begin utilizing these losses in a year that is open under statute and subject to federal or north carolina income tax examinations by tax authorities

income taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and may incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents  along with short term investments  totaled million  a decrease of million compared to december  the decrease in cash was primarily due to early january payment for the late december purchase of million of short term investments and million cash payments including million related to payroll and million for prior year pa studies accrued contract costs 
this is offset by the receipt of million for vimovo royalties from astrazeneca and million for the mt license agreement with desitin 
our cash is invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks and short term corporate fixed income obligations and us government agency obligations 
short term investments are held in a managed investment account designed to increase the return on our cash 
this account  which is invested as described above  is managed within our board approved investment policy  which restricts investments to maturities of less than twelve months  limits concentration to or less and requires minimum credit ratings of a p  among other requirements 
we have considered the impact of the current economic environment in evaluating the fair value of our investments 
we believe we are adhering to a conservative investment policy 
nonetheless  given the current market risks  a downgrade in any of our a p investments could result in required action under our investment policy  and may result in an investment loss 
because certain holdings in the managed account may have maturities longer than three months  such holdings would be classified as short term investments in our balance sheets and accounting principles require reporting such investments at fair value 
any difference between fair value and cost is reported in the stockholders equity section of our financial statements as comprehensive income or loss 
we received million in operating cash during the fiscal year ended december  pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreements with astrazeneca and desitin 
in addition  our balance sheet included a million accounts receivable for royalties under the astrazeneca agreement  which was subsequently received 
based upon the indirect method of presenting cash flow  cash used in operating activities totaled million and cash provided by operating activities totaled million for fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended december  totaled million  and net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended december  totaled million reflecting investing activities associated with the purchase and sale of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended december  totalled million and net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended december  totalled million 
cash required for our operating activities during is projected to decrease from our requirements as a result of decreased development and pre commercialization activities 
during the fiscal year ended december  and december  we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  associated with the grant of stock options and restricted stock 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash reserves and cash flow to maintain our planned development program for pa and pa and our planned level of business activities  through however  our anticipated cash flow includes continued receipt of royalty revenue from astrazeneca s sale of vimovo 
in addition  our expenses might increase during that period beyond currently expected levels if we decide to  or any regulatory agency requires us to  conduct additional clinical trials  studies or investigations for any of our product candidates  including in connection with the agency s consideration  or reconsideration  of our regulatory filings for our product candidates 
if our projected revenues decrease  we may need to raise additional capital 
if our projected expenses increase for our product candidates currently in development  or if we expand our studies for additional indications for our pa product candidate or new product candidates  then  as a result of these or other factors  we may need to raise additional capital 
our operating expenses for and are not expected to exceed but may exceed the net level of our operating expenses in  should we decide to conduct additional development work 

table of contents therefore  as part of our ongoing assessment of our business and liquidity needs  we regularly assess available funding options and will consider available funding opportunities as they arise 
we consider our current royalty stream as cash assets that could be monetized to accelerate the expected cash flow 
we also could sell shares of common stock in the future to fund additional development activities and increase our working capital 
we have filed with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the sec has declared effective  a shelf registration statement on form s under which we have registered up to  shares of our common stock for sale in one or more public offerings 
john r 
plachetka  selling stockholder named in the prospectus for the registration statement  may offer up to an aggregate of  of such shares  and we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sales of shares made by the selling stockholder 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our forecast of the period of time through which we expect that our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number and progress of our clinical trials and other trials and studies  our success  or any delays  in obtaining  regulatory approval of our product candidates and success in  and manner of  commercializing our products  the success of our existing collaborations and our ability to establish additional collaborations  costs incurred in pre commercialization activities for our products  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  technologies or products  costs incurred to enforce and defend our patent claims and other intellectual rights  our ability to negotiate favorable terms with various contractors assisting in our trials and studies  and costs incurred in the defense of our vimovo patent against generic companies that have filed andas with the fda to market the product prior to the expiration of our and astrazeneca s patents
