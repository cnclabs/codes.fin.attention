item a risk factors we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys  external research  planning processes  risk mapping  analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational  financial  environmental  reputational  strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business 
for more information about our risk management process  which is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify  see the description included in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders as defined in item of part iii of this annual report on form k under board s role in the risk management process 
we describe below all known material risks that could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or business prospects 
these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended  supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form k  form q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report on form k  in our annual report to lowe s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission  as well as in our press releases and other public communications  are qualified by the risks described below 
our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 
general economic factors and other conditions  both domestically and internationally  may adversely affect the us economy  the global economy and our financial performance 
these include  but are not limited to  periods of slow economic growth or recession  volatility and or lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and or higher cost of borrowing to lowe s and its customers  the sequester and related governmental spending and budget matters  slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income  sustained high rates of unemployment  high consumer debt levels  increasing fuel and energy costs  inflation or deflation of commodity prices  natural disasters  acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism in asia  the middle east and other parts of the world 
the continuing sluggish pace of the recovery from the deep global recession could continue to have an adverse effect on the rate of growth of discretionary spending by consumers and the share of such discretionary spending on home improvement products and services 
adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 
sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects 
slowly recovering home prices  the large number of households that continue to have little or negative equity  slowly declining mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates  restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing  slower household formation growth rates  and lower housing turnover through existing home sales  have limited  and may continue to limit  consumers discretionary spending  particularly on larger home improvement projects that are important to our business 
changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our business 
laws and regulations at the local  regional  state  federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors 
any changes in regulations  the imposition of additional regulations  or the enactment of any new legislation that affect employment labor  trade  product safety  transportation logistics  energy costs  health care  cyber security  tax or environmental issues  could have an adverse impact  directly or indirectly  on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and regulations can increase our cost of doing business 
in addition  we are subject to various procurement regulations applicable to our contracts for sales to the u 
s government and could be adversely affected by changes in those regulations or any negative findings from an audit or investigation 
we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising  marketing and distribution strategies effectively 
we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small  direct and indirect competitors 
the competitive environment in which we operate is particularly challenging during periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment with heavy promotions  particularly of discretionary items 
the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores  customer service  quality and price of merchandise and services  in stock levels  and merchandise assortment and presentation 
our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance 
moreover  changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors  including the effects of competitor liquidation activities  may impact our expected results 
our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 
part of our strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors 
to better distinguish our product offering  we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names 
the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 
operating internationally presents unique challenges that have required us to adapt our store operations  merchandising  marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico and to work effectively with our joint venture partner in australia 
a significant portion of our anticipated store growth over the next five years will be in canada and mexico 
we are also in a joint venture with australia s largest retailer  woolworths limited  to develop a network of home improvement stores for consumers in australia 
expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks  and slow the anticipated rate  of such expansion 
if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted  our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 
we source  stock  and sell products from over  domestic and international vendors 
we source a large number of those products from foreign manufacturers with china being the largest source 
financial instability among key vendors  political instability or labor unrest in source countries  retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country  tariffs  currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs 
if we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technologies to deliver business process solutions within the appropriate time frame  cost and functionality  our strategic initiatives that are dependent upon these technologies may not be successful 
the success of our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers expenditures on home improvement projects is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them 
extended delays or cost overruns in securing  developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the new business initiatives we are developing now  and will be developing in the future  would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 
we may not be able to achieve the objectives of the strategic initiatives we have underway if our organization is unable to make the transformational changes we are undertaking in our business model 
we are adapting our business model to meet our customers changing expectations that we will not only sell them the products and services they need and want  but also deliver  using new tools  skills and processes  a full service experience by being a part of their home improvement projects from start to finish 
our strategies require transformational changes to our business model and will require new competencies in some positions  and our employees and independent contractors  such as third party installers and repair technicians  will not only have to understand non traditional selling platforms but also commit to fundamental changes in lowe s culture and the processes through which they have traditionally interacted with customers 
to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes  our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers expenditures on home improvement projects may not be as successful as we expect them to be 
the many challenges our management faces in effectively managing our business as we adapt our business model also increase the risk that we may not achieve our objectives 
our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 
an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies  cost reductions  and sales and cash flow growth is the maintenance and ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as inventory replenishment  merchandise ordering  transportation  receipt processing and product delivery 
our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to maintain  improve  upgrade  and expand our systems 
as customer facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our multi channel sales and marketing strategy  the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 
access to the internet from computers  smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them 
our website  lowes 
com  is a sales channel for our products  and is also a method of making product  project and other relevant information available to them that influences our in store sales 
in addition to lowes 
com  we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire  inform  cross sell  establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers 
performance issues with these customer facing technology systems  including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or other cyber attacks  or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers perceptions of lowe s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 
our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer  employee or vendor data or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems and assets and such data from the threat of cyber attacks 
cyber attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving  and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of confidential information have occurred recently at a number of major us companies despite widespread recognition of the cyber attack threat and improved data protection methods 
while we have invested in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security procedures and controls over financial and other individually identifiable customer  employee and vendor data provided to us  a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions  loss of business or potential liability  including for possible punitive damages 
an electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks 
in addition  as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other company s obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter  a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 
if we fail to hire  train  manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists  or contract with qualified installers and repair technicians  with expanded skill sets who can work effectively and collaboratively in an increasingly culturally diverse environment  we could lose sales to our competitors 
our customers  whether they are homeowners or commercial businesses  expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide 
our customers also expect the independent contractors who install products they purchase from us to perform the installation in a timely and capable manner 
increasingly  our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets  including in some instances the ability to do in home or telephone sales 
in addition  in many of our stores our employees and third party contractors must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 
also  as our employees become increasingly culturally diverse  our managers and sales associates must be able to manage and work collaboratively with employees whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 
failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 
no single vendor of the products we sell accounts for more than of our total purchases  but we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell 
we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business 
if these vendors 
table of contents or service providers fail or are unable to perform as expected and we are unable to replace them quickly  our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to do so and potentially  in some cases  permanently 
failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales  profitability  cash flows and financial condition 
product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe s and the company s brand image 
as a result  lowe s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services  including both national and lowe s private brands  could suffer and impact customer loyalty 
additionally  a decline in product and service quality could result in product recalls  product liability and warranty claims 
future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences  including judgments or settlements 
we are  and in the future will become  involved in lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities 
the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain 
additionally  the possible outcomes of  or resolutions to  these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements  either of which could require substantial payments 
none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved  individually or collectively  is considered material 
item b unresolved staff comments none

the subsidiary is cooperating fully with the request

unless otherwise noted  all references herein for the years  and represent the fiscal years ended february   february  and january   respectively 
we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this discussion and analysis is presented in seven sections executive overview operations lowe s business outlook financial condition  liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and commercial commitments critical accounting policies and estimates executive overview during  we made progress on our key initiatives  continuing our journey to become the customer s first choice in home improvement 
the economic environment showed signs of improvement as fiscal represented the first year of growth across all of the core housing metrics housing turnover  single family starts  and median home prices 
these recent positive trends helped consumers regain confidence in both the local housing markets and their home values 
consequently  we were able to deliver solid results for the year 
net earnings for increased to billion and diluted earnings per share increased to 
net sales for increased to billion 
fiscal contained an extra week which contributed million to net sales or to diluted earnings per share 
comparable sales were  driven by a increase in comparable average ticket and a increase in comparable transactions 
for  cash flows from operating activities were approximately billion  with billion used for capital expenditures 
our strong financial position and positive cash flows provided us with the ability to make strategic investments in our core business and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases 
during fiscal  we paid million in dividends and repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for a total of billion under our share repurchase program 
continuing our journey in  we continued to deliver on our commitment to retail excellence by building on our core strengths  while developing capabilities to provide seamless support across channels and a simplified home improvement experience 
to further deliver a seamless and simple experience  we continued to upgrade our it infrastructure and gave customers and associates greater access to information and products through enhanced mobile technology  mylowes  and flexible fulfillment 
in  we made additional improvements to our associates iphone capabilities to enable them to deliver better customer experiences in the aisle by giving them immediate access to the information they need  such as the ability to identify available rebates 
our mylowes customer base also continues to grow 
since the launch of mylowes in late  there have been over million unique key fob swipes and over million cardholders have registered their cards on mylowes 
we also experienced strong customer response to our iphone and androidtm mobile applications which have grown to represent approximately of overall lowes 
com traffic 
in addition  flexible fulfillment now allows us to deliver in stock lowes 
com parcel orders to customers in over of us markets within hours at standard shipping rates 
as we redefine our business to become more seamless and simple  we must also continue to protect retail relevance 
in  our focus was on two key initiatives value improvement and product differentiation 
value improvement is designed to enhance our ability to offer compelling products and value while product differentiation is designed to help us drive excitement and flexibility in our stores by highlighting innovative products through better display techniques 
these strategic initiatives build on lowe s core strengths and are expected to deliver comparable transaction growth  better gross margins  and greater inventory productivity by localizing assortments and driving excitement in our stores 
value improvement enhances our ability to offer compelling products and value by having the right product  at the right quantity  at the right place  at the right time 
in  we leveraged our integrated planning and execution tool to create clusters of stores  based on specific differences and customer buying preferences  which enhanced the assortment strategy that was used to guide the line review process 
for each cluster  the product assortments were designed to reduce duplication of features and functions within price points to improve the customer experience 
we are also working to reduce unit costs by negotiating lower first costs from vendors by eliminating funds set aside for promotional and marketing support 
the result is a more localized assortment of products and simpler price point progression within the category 
as skus are rationalized  the teams are reinvesting the inventory dollars in greater depth of high volume skus 
in addition  we are increasing our in stock targets for these new lines to ensure items are available when needed by customers 
by the end of  we completed product line reviews and product line resets of approximately and of our business  respectively 
through our product differentiation initiative  we revised many of our end cap locations to highlight innovative products  significant values  or to showcase specific private or national brands 
in addition  we redesigned promotional spaces to better promote seasonally relevant  high value items to drive sales and to provide more open sight lines to navigate and shop at our stores 
during  our product differentiation resets were rolled out to approximately  stores  and we expect to roll the resets out to an additional stores in in conjunction with our progress on value improvement and product differentiation  in we also initiated sales training programs for store and contact center employees to further develop our sales culture and pave the way for the next phase of our transformation 
where we go from here and beyond while the housing market is slowly improving  consumers are still coping with the lingering effects of the recession as mortgage delinquency rates remain at historic highs 
while we are optimistic about a housing recovery and near term personal consumption expenditures are expected to grow faster than personal income  employment and income are expected to continue to grow slowly 
consumers will need to continue to prioritize how and where they spend their discretionary income and therefore our outlook for assumes modest growth in the home improvement market 
however we have confidence in our vision and have laid the foundation to continue improving our core business as we move into fiscal year in  our value improvement initiative will remain the primary focus of the organization 
as we improve our product offerings by localizing assortments we expect to drive improved close rates 
we also have an opportunity to improve close rates through additional labor in our stores 
we expect to add approximately hours per store per week to the staffing model for nearly two thirds of our stores to help reduce the gap between our weekend versus weekday close rate 
our goal is to better serve customers and close more sales during peak weekday hours by increasing assistance available in the aisles 
we believe the increased labor hours and higher in stock service levels will help us further capitalize on traffic during the week which will result in an improvement in close rates 
in and beyond  we will further develop our flexible fulfillment capability by deploying central dispatch cdo and central production offices cpo 
the cdo will allow for centralized delivery scheduling and better route planning  resulting in lower fuel cost  greater fleet utilization  and more productive overall delivery 
the cpo will provide operational efficiencies through the consolidation of labor 
today each store has its own installed sales office  whereas  in the future  that labor will be consolidated into our contact centers resulting in a significant reduction of labor hours 
the customer s experience will be enhanced through better coordination and consistency 
we will also build trust by partnering with customers to recommend solutions that fit their needs and to help them make the right decisions based on their individual home improvement goals 
beyond  we will further enhance our sales culture by providing our associates the ability to sell seamlessly across channels and to introduce improved project management tools that expand fulfillment capabilities to cultivate personal and simple connections with customers 
associates across selling channels will be provided with a single view of the customer  one record per customer  from lead capture to project completion 
these changes will enable us to improve close rates and capitalize on the momentum of the improving economy and increases in consumer discretionary spending 
by building on core strengths  we have laid the foundation to deliver on our commitment to retail excellence  and will continue to focus on developing the capabilities to provide our customers a seamless and simple home improvement experience going forward 
operations the following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings  as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year

ebit margin  also referred to as operating margin  is defined as earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales 
a comparable location is defined as a location that has been open longer than months 
a location that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable one month prior to its relocation 
the relocated location must then remain open longer than months to be considered comparable 
a location we have decided to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing 
comparable sales are based on comparable week periods for and and comparable week periods for average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions 
average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period 
return on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters 
return on average shareholders equity is defined as net earnings divided by average shareholders equity for the last five quarters 
return on invested capital is a non gaap financial measure 
see below for additional information 
return on invested capital return on invested capital roic is considered a non gaap financial measure 
we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the company uses capital to generate profits 
we define roic as trailing four quarters net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters 
although roic is a common financial metric  numerous methods exist for calculating roic 
accordingly  the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic 
we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 
we consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to roic 
the difference between these two measures is that roic adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense 
the calculation of roic  together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity  the most comparable gaap financial measure  is as follows in millions  except percentage data calculation of return on invested capital numerator net earnings plus interest expense net provision for income taxes earnings before interest and taxes less income tax adjustment net operating profit after tax effective tax rate denominator average debt and equity return on invested capital calculation of return on average debt and equity numerator net earnings denominator average debt and equity return on average debt and equity income tax adjustment is defined as earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate 
average debt and equity is defined as average debt  including current maturities and short term borrowings  plus total equity for the last five quarters 
fiscal compared to fiscal for the purpose of the following discussion  comparable sales  comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions are based on comparable week periods 
net sales net sales increased to billion in the additional week in and resulting week shift in negatively impacted sales comparisons by million  or 
comparable sales increased in  driven by a increase in comparable average ticket and a increase in comparable customer transactions 
our key initiatives  value improvement and product differentiation  drove basis points of the increase in sales 
in addition  our proprietary credit value proposition  which offers customers the choice of off every day or promotional financing  contributed basis points to the increase in sales 
geographically  all operating divisions in the us delivered positive comparable sales for the year as sales performance was well balanced in furthermore  we continued to see strength in our pro services business  which outperformed the company average 
we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories during lumber  tools outdoor power equipment  paint  seasonal living  cabinets countertops  and home fashions  storage cleaning 
in addition  fashion electrical  hardware  flooring and plumbing performed at approximately the overall company average 
inflation aided comparable sales throughout the year in both the lumber and paint categories 
comparable sales for paint also benefited from new product offerings 
hurricane sandy also contributed to comparable sale increases for lumber  as a result of storm response efforts  and for tools outdoor power equipment  due to increased generator sales 
in addition  tools outdoor power equipment comparable sales were also positively impacted by favorable weather in the first half of the year combined with effective promotions 
comparable sales were below the company average in building materials  millwork  appliances  and lawn garden 
the timing of storm recovery and repair efforts in as compared to resulted in decreased comparable sales in building materials 
in addition  difficult comparisons to prior year promotional activity led to decreased comparable sales in millwork and appliances 
lawn garden was impacted by extreme heat and drought conditions in the first half of the year  slightly offset by improved inventory planning and attachment rates in the second half of the year 
gross margin gross margin of for represented a basis point decrease from  primarily driven by an unfavorable basis point impact related to our proprietary credit value proposition 
in addition  we experienced a seven basis point unfavorable impact to margin related to pricing and promotional activity 
sg a the basis point decrease in sg a expense as a percentage of sales from to was primarily driven by basis points of leverage due to long lived asset impairment and other costs associated with the store closures and discontinued projects in we also experienced approximately basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program  which was driven by increased portfolio income as a result of continued growth in the program 
these were partially offset by deleverage of approximately basis points associated with incentive compensation  due to higher attainment levels compared to targets for store based employees relative to last year 
in addition  we experienced nine basis points of deleverage in contract labor associated with information technology projects to improve customer experiences 
depreciation depreciation expense deleveraged six basis points for compared to primarily due to higher depreciation associated with it capital investments made to improve customer experiences  which have shorter average useful lives 
property  less accumulated depreciation  decreased to billion at february  compared to billion at february  at february  and february   we owned of our stores  which included stores on leased land 
interest net net interest expense is comprised of the following in millions interest expense  net of amount capitalized amortization of original issue discount and loan costs interest income interest net net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of billion and billion of unsecured notes in november and april  respectively  partially offset by favorable tax settlements that resulted in a reduced interest accrual during income tax provision our effective income tax rate was in compared to in the lower effective tax rate in was the result of the recognition of one time federal employee retention benefits from the federal hire hiring incentives to restore employment retention tax credit  as well as the favorable settlement of certain state tax matters in the third quarter of fiscal compared to fiscal for the purpose of the following discussion  comparable sales  comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions are based on comparable week periods 
net sales net sales increased to billion in  while comparable sales were flat 
the additional week in contributed to the increase in net sales 
comparable customer transactions increased approximately and comparable average ticket decreased versus while comparable sales were flat in  we saw sequential improvement each quarter  with comparable sales of negative in the first quarter  negative in the second quarter  positive in the third quarter and positive in the fourth quarter 
unseasonably cold  wet weather  severe storms and flooding during the first quarter as well as comparisons to the cash for appliances government incentive program led to lower performance during the first half of the year 
however  as comparisons to the cash for appliances program eased and storm recovery efforts were underway  we saw improvement in comparable sales 
in addition  strong customer response to our off every day offer to lowe s credit cardholders  launched in the first half of  aided comparable sales for the balance of the year 
we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories during building materials  fashion electrical  paint  hardware  plumbing  and tools outdoor power equipment 
in addition  seasonal living  home fashions  storage cleaning  flooring  lawn garden and lumber performed at approximately the overall company average 
although unfavorable weather in the early part of the year negatively impacted outdoor categories such as building materials  recovery efforts after severe spring storms that hit many regions of the country and hurricane irene positively impacted comparable sales in building materials  with particularly strong sales of roofing products and installation services 
plumbing also benefited from the wet weather and storm recovery efforts  with strong sales of pumps tanks and dehumidifiers 
in addition  tools outdoor power equipment experienced favorable comparable sales primarily driven by holiday promotions and strong customer response to new products  such as our new line of kobalt mechanics tools 
fashion electrical also performed above the company average during  driven by increased customer demand for energy saving light bulbs  outdoor lighting and electrical cable 
however  difficult comparisons to prior year energy tax credits negatively impacted comparable sales in millwork 
in addition  while we experienced strong market share gains in cabinets countertops  they were not enough to offset the impact of the contracting market  leading to comparable sales below the company average for the year 
appliances also experienced negative comparable sales for the year driven by comparisons to the prior year cash for appliances program  which primarily impacted the first half of the year 
gross margin gross margin of for represented a basis point decrease from  primarily driven by margin rate 
strong customer response to our off every day offer to lowe s credit cardholders  targeted promotional activity and pricing changes associated with our move to every day low prices negatively impacted margin for the year 
margin was also negatively impacted by basis points associated with distribution expenses  primarily related to higher fuel costs 
in addition  lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  primarily related to the stores that closed in the second half of the year  negatively impacted margin by six basis points 
these were partially offset by basis points of favorable impact associated with the mix of products sold across product categories 
sg a the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales from to was primarily driven by de leverage of basis points related to charges for store closings  discontinued projects and long lived asset impairments 
we also experienced approximately basis points of de leverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences  including expenses associated with additional internal and external staffing and technology expenditures 
in addition  we experienced de leverage in payroll taxes and fleet expense 
these increases were partially offset by leverage of approximately basis points associated with our proprietary credit program due to reduced program costs associated with lower losses and lower promotional financing as more customers took advantage of the off every day offer 
in addition  bonus expense leveraged basis points due to lower attainment levels for the year relative to plan 
depreciation depreciation expense leveraged basis points for compared to primarily due to a lower asset base resulting from decreased capital spending and assets becoming fully depreciated or impaired 
property  less accumulated depreciation  decreased to billion at february  compared to billion at january  at february  and january   we owned of our stores  which included stores on leased land 
interest net interest expense is comprised of the following in millions interest expense  net of amount capitalized amortization of original issue discount and loan costs interest income interest net net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of billion of notes during and billion of notes during  offset by the repayment of million of notes during income tax provision our effective income tax rate was in compared to in the reduction in the effective tax rate was predominantly due to the recognition of benefits from the federal hire hiring incentives to restore employment retention tax credit as well as various state tax credit programs 
lowe s business outlook as of february   the date of our fourth quarter earnings release  we expected total sales in to increase approximately and comparable sales to increase approximately 
we expected to open approximately stores during in addition  earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales operating margin were expected to increase approximately basis points and the effective tax rate was expected to be approximately 
diluted earnings per share of were expected for the fiscal year ending january  our guidance assumed approximately billion in share repurchases during  spread evenly across the four quarters 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for versus was primarily driven by changes in working capital 
the change in working capital was primarily driven by the timing of tax payments during the periods 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for versus was primarily driven by a decrease in capital expenditures in addition to an increase in proceeds received from the sale of property and other long term assets  partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale maturity of investments 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities for was primarily driven by an increase in cash used to repurchase shares  which included shares repurchased under our share repurchase program and shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities upon vesting of restricted stock awards 
this was partially offset by the net change in long term debt and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to options exercised 
sources of liquidity in addition to our cash flows from operations  liquidity is provided by our short term borrowing facilities 
we have a billion senior credit facility that expires in october the senior credit facility supports our commercial paper program and has a million letter of credit sublimit 
letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior credit facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms 
borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants  which include maintenance of a debt leverage ratio as defined by the senior credit facility 
we were in compliance with those covenants at february  thirteen banking institutions are participating in the senior credit facility 
there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the senior credit facility and no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program at february  we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short term and long term bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long term debt 
the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected  however  by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios 
the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard poor s s p and moody s as of april   which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds 
although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings  our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
debt ratings s p moody s commercial paper a p senior debt a a outlook negative stable we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements  but also for investments in information technology  investments in our existing stores  expansion plans and acquisitions  if any  and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases over the next months 
there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price 
in addition  we do not have a significant amount of cash held in foreign affiliates that would not be available to fund domestic operations 
cash requirements capital expenditures our fiscal capital budget is approximately billion  inclusive of approximately million of lease commitments  resulting in a planned net cash outflow of billion 
approximately of the planned net cash outflow is for investments to enhance the customer experience  including enhancements in information technology 
investments in our existing stores are expected to account for approximately of net cash outflow including investments in store equipment  resets and remerchandising 
our expansion plans for consist of approximately new stores  all of which are expected to be owned  and which will account for approximately of the planned net cash outflow 
approximately of these new stores are expected to be on leased land 
other planned capital expenditures  accounting for of planned net cash outflow  are for investments in our distribution network  including one additional regional distribution center 
debt and capital in april  we issued billion of unsecured notes in three tranches million of notes maturing in april  million of notes maturing in april and million of notes maturing in april net proceeds from the  and notes were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
during  million of unsecured debt matured and was re paid with cash from operations and investing activities 
dividends declared during fiscal totaled million 
our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared 
the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of was paid in fiscal and totaled million 
we have an ongoing share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time in the open market or through private off market transactions 
shares purchased under the share repurchase program are returned to authorized and unissued status 
on february   the company s board of directors authorized an additional billion of share repurchases with no expiration  simultaneously terminating the remaining previous balance of million under the prior authorization 
this share repurchase authorization is expected to be used by the end of fiscal our ratio of debt to equity plus debt was and as of february   and february   respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements other than in connection with executing operating leases  we do not have any off balance sheet financing that has  or is reasonably likely to have  a material  current or future effect on our financial condition  cash flows  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at february  payments due by period contractual obligations less than after in millions total year years years years long term debt principal amounts  excluding discount long term debt interest payments capitalized lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration by period commercial commitments less than after in millions total year years years years letters of credit amounts do not include taxes  common area maintenance  insurance or contingent rent because these amounts have historically been insignificant 
represents commitments related to certain marketing and information technology programs  and purchases of merchandise inventory 
letters of credit are issued primarily for insurance and construction contracts 
at february   our reserve for uncertain tax positions including penalties and interest was million  of which million was classified as a current liability and million was classified as a noncurrent liability 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this form k requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable  all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventory description we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost 
this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels  sales trends and historical experience 
during  our reserve increased approximately million to million as of february  we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories 
this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories 
during  the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately million to million as of february  in addition  we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business  principally as a result of purchase volumes  sales  early payments or promotions of vendors products 
generally  these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor s product 
therefore  we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued  and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold 
funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term  and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions 
however  changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves 
likewise  changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary  based on the timing and results of physical inventories 
we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of non productive inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 
for vendor funds  we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place 
due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements  we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year  adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded 
amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes  especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years 
we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves 
however  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves 
a change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for a change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory 
however  substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective long term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year 
adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 
long lived asset impairment description we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
when evaluating locations for impairment  our asset group is at an individual location level  as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable 
cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 
we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location s asset carrying values may not be recoverable 
for operating locations  our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results 
management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment  including individual locations execution of their operating plans and local market conditions  including incursion  which is the opening of either other lowe s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market 
we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location  management makes assumptions  incorporating local market conditions  about key store variables including sales growth rates  gross margin and controllable expenses  such as store payroll and occupancy expense  as well as asset residual values or lease rates 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations  which requires discounting projected future cash flows 
this involves making assumptions regarding both a location s future cash flows  as described above  and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows 
we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows 
the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 
we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure 
this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated 
the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred  including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows  including estimated sales  margin and controllable expenses  and assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure 
we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values  including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions during  operating locations experienced a triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability 
five of the operating locations were determined to be impaired 
we recorded impairment losses related to these five operating locations of million during  compared to impairment losses on operating locations and locations identified for closure of million during we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years 
if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values  our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses 
seven of the operating locations that experienced a triggering event during were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired 
for these seven locations  the expected undiscounted cash flows substantially exceeded the net book value of the location s assets 
a reduction in projected sales used to estimate future cash flows at the latest date that these seven operating locations were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of four of these locations and increased recognized impairment losses by approximately million 
we analyzed other assumptions made in estimating the future cash flows of the operating locations evaluated for impairment  but the sensitivity of those assumptions was not significant to the estimates 
store closing lease obligations description when locations under operating leases are closed  we recognize a liability for the fair value of future contractual obligations associated with the leased location 
the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present value cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payments  property taxes  utilities  common area maintenance and other ongoing expenses  net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable items  discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate 
the expected present value cash flow model uses a probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flows to certain scenarios based on the expected likelihood of outcomes 
estimating the fair value involves making assumptions regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated 
the information includes comparable lease rates of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for leasing these assets 
subsequent changes to the liability  including a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows  are recognized in the period of the change 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our store closing lease liability calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows  primarily related to estimated sublease income  and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions during  the company relocated one store subject to an operating lease 
during  stores under operating lease were closed  which includes one store that was relocated 
we recorded million and million of expense for store closing lease obligations during and  respectively 
for  these charges included million related to locations closed or relocated during and million of adjustments related to previously closed or relocated locations 
we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the expected future cash flows of closed locations under operating leases during the past three fiscal years 
if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in estimating expected future cash flows  our store closing lease obligation losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated losses 
a change in the store closing lease liability would have affected net earnings by approximately million for self insurance description we are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  automobile  general and product liability  extended protection plan  and certain medical and dental claims 
our self insured retention or deductible  as applicable  is limited to million per occurrence involving workers compensation and million per occurrence involving automobile  general or product liability 
additionally  a corridor retention of million per occurrence applies to commercial general liability and product liability claims  subject to a million maximum over a three year period 
we do not have any stop loss limits for self insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience 
during  our self insurance liability increased approximately million to million as of february  during  we reduced the discount rate applied to self insurance claims by basis points  which resulted in a million unfavorable impact to net earnings 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment  utilized discount rate  projected exposures including payroll  sales and vehicle units  as well as the frequency  lag and severity of claims 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal years 
although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self insurance liabilities 
a change in our self insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately million for a basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately million for revenue recognition description see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty 
we sell separately priced extended protection plan contracts under a lowe s branded program for which the company is ultimately self insured 
the company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straight line basis over the respective contract term 
extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer s warranty  as applicable 
the company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses 
a loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts 
deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts increased million to million as of february  we defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed 
revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received 
we use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions 
during  deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased million to million as of february  judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate for extended protection plans  there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts 
there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts 
for the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed  there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years 
we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts 
although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses under the extended protection plan contracts  it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates 
in addition  if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straight line basis  the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change 
a change in the amount of revenue recognized in under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately million 
we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed 
we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may incur additional income or expense 
a change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately million in disclosure regarding forward looking statements we speak throughout this annual report on form k in forward looking statements about our future  but particularly in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the words believe  expect  will  should  and other similar expressions are intended to identify those forward looking statements 
while we believe our expectations are reasonable  they are not guarantees of future performance 
our actual results could differ substantially from our expectations 
for a detailed description of the risks and uncertainties that we are exposed to  you should read the risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k to the united states securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or  in the case of any document incorporated by reference  the date of that document 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section and in the risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events  circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we are exposed to certain market risks  including changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our long term debt is carried at amortized cost and consists of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for financial instruments 
commodity price risk we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control 
we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices 
the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced  in part  by the market price we pay  which is determined by industry supply and demand 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we have international operating entities  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and results of operations
