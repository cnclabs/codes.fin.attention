qualified thrift lender test federal savings associations must meet a qualified thrift lender qtl test or they become subject to operating restrictions 
the bank met the qtl test as of december   and anticipates that it will maintain an appropriate level of mortgage related investments which must be at least of portfolio assets and will otherwise continue to meet the qtl test requirements 
portfolio assets are all assets minus goodwill and other intangible assets  property used by the institution in conducting its business  and liquid assets not exceeding of total assets 
compliance with the qtl test is determined on a monthly basis in nine out of every twelve months 
liquidity standards each federal savings association must maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operations 
management of the bank believes it has established policies  procedures  and practices to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet the bank s obligations and otherwise ensure its safe and sound operation 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the fhlb of chicago  one of twelve regional federal home loan banks 
each federal home loan bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its region 
it is funded primarily from funds deposited by member financial institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the federal home loan bank system 
the fhlb of chicago makes loans advances to members pursuant to policies and procedures established by its board of directors 
the fhlb of chicago imposes limits on advances made to member banks  including limitations relating to the amount and type of collateral and the amount of advances 
as a member of the fhlb of chicago  the bank must meet certain eligibility requirements and must purchase and maintain common stock in the fhlb of chicago in an amount equal to the greater of i of its mortgage related assets at the most recent calendar year end  ii of its outstanding advances from the fhlb of chicago  or iii  at december   the bank owned million in fhlb of chicago common stock  which was approximately million more than the bank would otherwise be required to own under minimum guidelines established by the fhlb of chicago 
management believes the fhlb of chicago will repurchase this excess common stock in  although there can be no assurances 
during  the fhlb of chicago repurchased million of excess common stock that had been owned by the bank 
for additional discussion related to the bank s investment in the common stock of the fhlb of chicago  refer to item a

deposit insurance the deposit accounts held by customers of the bank are insured by the fdic up to maximum limits  as provided by law 
insurance on deposits may be terminated by the fdic if it finds that the bank has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or the occ 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition  or violation that might lead to termination of the bank s deposit insurance 
the fdic sets deposit insurance premiums based upon the risks a particular bank or savings association poses to its deposit insurance funds 
under the risk based assessment system  the fdic assigns an institution to one of three capital categorizations based on the institution s financial information 
with respect to these three categorizations  institutions are classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized using ratios that are substantially similar to the prompt corrective action capital ratios discussed above 
the fdic also assigns an institution to one of three supervisory sub categorizations within each capital group 
this assignment is based on a supervisory evaluation provided by the institution s primary federal regulator and information that the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
an institution s assessment rate depends on the capital categorizations and supervisory sub categorizations to which it is assigned 
under the risk based assessment system  there are then four assessment risk categories to which different assessment rates are applied refer to the next paragraph for a description of these assessment rates 
any increase in insurance assessments could have an adverse effect on the earnings of insured institutions  including the bank 
effective in april the fdic changed the definition of a financial institution s deposit insurance assessment base and revised the deposit insurance risk based assessment rate schedule  among other things 
under the revised rule the assessment base changed from an insured institution s domestic deposits minus certain allowable exclusions to an insured institution s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity and certain other adjustments 
in addition  the assessment rates were established in a range of to basis points  depending on the institution s capital category and supervisor sub category  as previously described 
for additional discussion  refer to results of operations non interest expense in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the fdic created the transaction account guarantee program tagp  which provided participating banks with full deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts  regardless of dollar amount through december  as subsequently extended 
as of january   however  fdic insured financial institutions non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts are no longer fully insured under this program 
this development is not expected to have a material impact on the bank or the deposit insurance premiums paid by the bank 
transactions with affiliates sections a and b of the federal reserve act and frb regulation w govern transactions between an insured federal savings association  such as the bank  and any of its affiliates  such as the company 
an affiliate is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with it 
sections a and b limit the extent to which an institution or a subsidiary may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such savings association s capital stock and surplus  and limit all such transactions with all affiliates to of such stock and surplus 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans  purchase of assets  issuance of guarantees  derivatives transactions  securities borrowing  and lending transactions to the extent that they result in credit exposure to an affiliate 
further  most loans by a savings association to any of its affiliates must be secured by specified collateral amounts 
all such transactions must be on terms that are consistent with save and sound banking practices and must be on terms that are at least as favorable to the savings association as those that would be provided to a non affiliate 
at december   the company and bank did not have any covered transactions 
acquisitions and mergers under the federal bank merger act  any merger of the bank with or into another institution would require the approval of the occ  or the primary federal regulator of the resulting entity if it is not an occ regulated institution 
refer also to regulation and supervision of the company acquisition of bank mutual corporation  below 
prohibitions against tying arrangements savings associations are subject to the prohibitions of usc section on certain tying arrangements 
a savings association is prohibited  subject to exceptions  from extending credit to or offering any other service  or fixing or varying the consideration for such credit or service  on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor 
uniform real estate lending standards the federal banking agencies adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on interests in real estate or are made to finance the construction of a building or other improvements to real estate 
all insured depository institutions must adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for such extensions of credit 
these policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards  prudent underwriting standards that are clear and measurable  loan administration procedures  and documentation  approval and reporting requirements 
these lending policies must reflect consideration of the interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies that have been adopted by the federal bank regulators 
these guidelines  among other things  require a depository institution to establish internal loan to value limits for real estate loans that are not in excess of specified supervisory limits  which generally vary and provide for lower loan to value limits for types of collateral that are perceived as having more risk  are subject to fluctuations in valuation  or are difficult to dispose 
although there is no supervisory loan to value limit for owner occupied one to four family and home equity loans  the guidelines provide that an institution should require credit enhancement in the form of mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral for any such loan with a loan to value ratio that equals or exceeds at origination 
the guidelines also clarify expectations for prudent appraisal and evaluation policies  procedures  and practices  and make other changes  in light of the dodd frank act and other recent federal statutory changes affecting appraisals 
community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act cra  any insured depository institution  including the bank  must  consistent with its safe and sound operation  help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
the cra requires the occ to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution  including applications for additional branches and acquisitions 
among other things  the cra regulations contain an evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs 
in particular  the evaluation system focuses on three tests i a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  ii an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of making community development investments  and iii a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  atms and other offices 
the cra requires the occ to provide a written evaluation of the bank s cra performance utilizing a four tiered descriptive rating system and requires public disclosure of the cra rating 
the bank received a satisfactory overall rating in its most recent cra examination 
safety and soundness standards each federal banking agency  including the occ  has guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  customer privacy  liquidity  earnings  and compensation and benefits 
the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines also prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice 
loans to insiders a savings association s loans to its executive officers  directors  any owner of more than of its stock each  an insider and certain entities affiliated with any such person an insider s related interest are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by section h of the federal reserve act and the frb s regulation o thereunder 
under these restrictions  the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and related interests may not exceed the loans to one borrower limit applicable to national banks 
all loans by a savings association to all insiders and related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the savings association s unimpaired capital and surplus 
with certain exceptions  the bank s loans to an executive officer other than certain education loans and residential mortgage loans may not exceed  regulation o also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest be approved in advance by a majority of the bank s board of directors  without the vote of any interested director  if such loan  when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and related interests  would exceed  generally  such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than  those for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectability 
there is an exception for extensions of credit pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a savings association that is widely available to employees that does not give preference to officers  directors  and other insiders 
as of december   total loans to insiders were  including  which relates to residential mortgages that have been sold in the secondary market 
regulation and supervision of the company general the company is a registered savings and loan holding company under federal law and is subject to regulation  supervision  and enforcement actions by the frb 
among other things  this authority permits the frb to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to the bank and to monitor and regulate the company s capital and activities such as dividends and share repurchases that can affect capital 
under long standing frb policy  holding companies are expected to serve as a source of strength for their depository subsidiaries  and may be called upon to commit financial resources and support to those subsidiaries 
the requirement that the company act as a source of strength for the bank  and the future capital requirements at the company level refer to regulatory capital requirements  below  may affect the company ability to pay dividends or make other distributions 
the company may engage in activities permissible for a savings and loan holding company  a bank holding company  or a financial holding company  which generally encompass a wider range of activities that are financial in nature 
the company may not engage in any activities beyond that scope without the approval of the frb 
federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from acquiring control of another savings institution or holding company without prior written regulatory approval 
with some exceptions  it also prohibits the acquisition or retention of more than of the equity securities of a company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature or acquiring an institution that is not federally insured 
in evaluating applications to acquire savings institutions  the regulator must consider the financial and managerial resources  future prospects of the institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
regulatory capital requirements the company is not currently required by the frb to maintain minimum regulatory capital at the consolidated level 
however  under the dodd frank act  the frb is required to impose capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies effective in management believes these capital requirements will be substantially the same as those currently required for bank holding companies 
management also believes the company would have exceeded all regulatory minimum capital requirements as of december   had it been subject to bank holding company capital requirements as of that date 
proposed regulatory capital requirements in the federal banking agencies issued proposed regulatory capital rules under basel iii  as previously described 
the proposed rules  if adopted  are expected to have a significant impact on the minimum regulatory requirements of regulated financial institutions such as the company  to include accelerating the timing of the regulatory capital requirements for the company at the consolidated level  as discussed in the previous paragraph 
however  management believes the regulatory capital of the company will exceed the minimum requirements established in the proposed rules and that the implementation or timing of the rules will not have a significant adverse impact on the financial condition  liquidity  or operations of the company 
it is not known at this time when the proposed rules will become effective or whether the proposed rules will be substantially modified prior to their becoming effective 
federal securities laws the company s common stock is registered with the sec under the securities exchange act of the company is therefore subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the securities exchange act 
as a publicly traded company  the company is also subject to legislation intended to strengthen the securities markets and public confidence in them 
because some frb accounting and governance regulations also refer to the sec s regulations  the sec rules may also affect the bank 
acquisition of bank mutual corporation no person may acquire control of the company without first obtaining the approval of such acquisition by the appropriate federal regulator 
currently  under the federal change in bank control act and the savings and loan holding company act  any person  including a company  or group acting in concert  seeking to acquire or more of the outstanding shares of the company must  depending on the circumstances  obtain the approval of  and or file a notice with the frb 
also  any person or group acting in concert seeking to acquire more than of the company s common stock must obtain the prior approval of the frb 
federal and state taxation federal taxation the company and its subsidiaries file a calendar year consolidated federal income tax return  reporting income and expenses using the accrual method of accounting 
the federal income tax returns for the company s subsidiaries have been examined and audited or closed without audit by the internal revenue service for tax years prior to state taxation the company and its subsidiaries are subject to combined reporting in the state of wisconsin 
which includes the bank s out of state investment subsidiaries since for additional discussion regarding the impact of this change  refer to results of operations income tax expense benefit in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
also  refer to item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the discussion and analysis set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the cautionary statements set forth in item business  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the company s results of operations  financial condition  and outlook 
these risk factors should also be considered when evaluating any investment decision with respect to the company s common stock 
the global credit market volatility and weak economic conditions may significantly affect the company s liquidity  financial condition  and results of operations global financial markets continue to be unstable and unpredictable  and economic conditions have been relatively weak 
developments relating to the federal budget  federal borrowing authority  or other political issues could also negatively impact these markets  as could global developments such as the european sovereign debt crisis 
continued  and potentially increased  volatility  instability and weakness could affect the company s ability to sell investment securities and other financial assets  which in turn could adversely affect the company s liquidity and financial position 
these factors could also affect the prices at which the company could make any such sales  which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
conditions could also negatively affect the company s ability to secure funds or raise capital for acquisitions and other projects  which in turn  could cause the company to use deposits or other funding sources for such projects 
in addition  the volatility of the markets and weakness of the economy could affect the strength of the company s customers or counterparties  their willingness to do business with  and or their ability or willingness to fulfill their obligations to the company  which could further affect the company s results of operations 
current conditions  including relatively high unemployment  weak corporate performance  and soft real estate markets  could negatively affect the volume of loan originations and prepayments  the value of the real estate securing the company s mortgage loans  and borrowers ability or willingness to repay loan obligations  all of which could adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s actual loan losses may exceed its allowance for loan losses  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations the company has policies and procedures in place to manage its exposure to risk related to its lending operations 
however  despite these practices  the company s loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
economic weakness  including high unemployment rates and lower values for the collateral underlying loans  may affect borrowers ability or willingness to repay their loan obligations that could lead to increased loan losses or provisions 
as a result  the company may experience significant loan losses  including losses that may exceed the amounts established in the allowance for loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and capital 
further declines in real estate values may continue to adversely affect collateral values and the company s results of operations the company s market areas have generally experienced lower real estate values  higher levels of residential and non residential tenant vacancies  and weakness in the market for sale of new or existing properties  for both commercial and residential real estate 
these developments could continue to negatively affect the value of the collateral securing the company s mortgage and related loans 
that decrease in value could in turn lead to increased losses on loans in the event of foreclosures 
increased losses would affect the company s loan loss allowance and may cause it to increase its provision for loan losses resulting in a charge to earnings and capital 
some of the company s lending activities are riskier than one to four family real estate loans the company has identified commercial real estate  commercial business  construction  and consumer loans as areas for lending emphasis and has augmented its personnel in recent periods to increase its penetration in the commercial lending market 
while the company is pursuing this lending diversification for the purpose of increasing net interest income  these types of loans historically have carried greater risk of payment default than residential real estate loans 
as the volume of these types of loans increases  credit risk increases 
in the event of continued substantial borrower defaults and or increased defaults resulting from these diverse types of lending  the company s provision for loan losses would further increase and loans may be written off  and therefore  earnings would be reduced 
further  as the portion of the company loans secured by the assets of commercial enterprises increases  the company becomes increasingly exposed to environmental liabilities and compliance burdens 
even though the company is subject to environmental requirements in connection with residential real estate lending  the possibility of liability increases in connection with commercial lending  particularly in industries that use hazardous materials and or generate waste or pollution or that own property that was the subject of prior contamination 
if the company does not adequately assess potential environment risks  the value of the collateral it holds may be less than it expects  and it may be exposed to liability for remediation or other environmental compliance 
regulators are becoming increasingly stringent  which may affect the company business and results of operations in addition to new laws and increasing amounts of regulation  the regulatory climate in the us  particularly for financial institutions  has become increasingly strict and stringent 
as a consequence  regulatory activity affecting specific institutions has also increased in recent periods 
further  because the responsibility for regulating savings associations and their holding companies has transitioned to different regulatory agencies  the frb and the occ  these agencies may approach that regulation in different or stricter ways than the predecessor agency  which also could affect the company and the bank costs of compliance and results of operations 
the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company is subject to current and potential future limitations that may affect the company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders and repurchase its stock the company is a separate legal entity from the bank and engages in no substantial activities other than its ownership of the common stock of the bank 
consequently  the company s net income and cash flows are derived primarily from the bank s operations and capital distributions 
the availability of dividends from the bank to the company is limited by various statutes and regulations  including those of the occ and frb  as a result  it is possible  depending on the results of operations and the financial condition of the bank and other factors  that the occ and or the frb could restrict the payment by the bank of dividends or other capital distributions or take other actions which could negatively affect the bank results and dividend capacity 
the federal regulators have become increasingly stringent in their interpretation  application and enforcement of banks capital requirements  which could affect the regulators willingness to allow bank dividends to the company 
if the bank is required to reduce its dividends to the company  or is unable to pay dividends at all  or the frb separately does not allow the company to pay dividends  the company may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders at existing levels or at all and or may not be able to repurchase its common stock 
future events may result in a valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax asset which may have a significant effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition as of december   the company s net deferred tax asset was million 
management evaluates this asset on an on going basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
management determined that no valuation allowance was required to be recorded against the company s net deferred tax asset as of december  this determination required significant management judgment based on positive and negative considerations 
such considerations included the company s cumulative three year net loss  the nature of the components of such cumulative loss  recent trends in earnings excluding one time charges such as the fhlb prepayment penalty in and the goodwill impairment in  expectations for the company s future earnings  the duration of federal and state net operating loss carryforward periods  and other factors 
future events or circumstances could result in conditions that differ significantly from management s current assessment of these positive and negative considerations  particularly as such relate to the company s future earnings 
changes in these considerations could result in a significant valuation allowance being recorded against the company s net deferred tax asset  which could have a significant effect on the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
recent and future legislation and rulemaking in response to market and economic conditions may significantly affect the company s results of operations and financial condition instability  volatility  and failures in the credit and financial institutions markets in recent years have led regulators and legislators to consider and or adopt proposals that will significantly affect financial institutions and their holding companies  including the company 
legislation such as the emergency economic stabilization act of  the american recovery and reinvestment act of  and the dodd frank act of  as well as programs such as the troubled assets relief program  were adopted 
in addition  in the federal banking agencies issued proposed rules to implement certain revisions to regulatory capital requirements as specified by basel iii 
although designed to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate impact of these actions on financial markets  which could have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the value of the company s securities 
further legislative and regulatory proposals to reform the us financial system would also affect the company and the bank 
the dodd frank act created the cfpb  which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority with respect to entities  including financial institutions  that offer to consumers covered financial products and services 
the cfpb is required to adopt rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair  deceptive or abusive relating to any customer transaction for a consumer financial product or service  or the offering of a consumer financial product or service 
the full scope of the impact of this authority has not yet been determined as related rules have not all yet been adopted 
the company cannot yet determine the costs and limitations related to these additional regulatory requirements  however  the costs of compliance and the effect on its business may have a material adverse effect on the company operations and results 
recently enacted laws  proposed acts  taxes and fees  or any other legislation or regulations ultimately enacted  could materially affect the company  the bank and their operations and profitability by imposing additional regulatory burdens and costs  imposing limits on fees and other sources of income  and otherwise more generally affecting the conduct of their business 
the interest rate environment may have an adverse impact on the company s net interest income volatile interest rate environments make it difficult for the company to coordinate the timing and amount of changes in the rates of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings with the rates of interest it earns on loans and securities 
in addition  volatile interest rate environments cause corresponding volatility in the demand by individuals and businesses for the loan and deposit products offered by the company 
these factors have a direct impact on the company s net interest income  and consequently  its net income 
future interest rates could continue to be volatile and management is unable to predict the impact such volatility would have on the net interest income and profits of the company 
changes in market interest rates or other conditions may have an adverse impact on the fair value of the company s available for sale securities  shareholders equity  and profits gaap requires the company to carry its available for sale securities at fair value on its balance sheet 
unrealized gains or losses on these securities  reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost  net of its tax effect  are included as a component of shareholders equity 
when market rates of interest increase  the fair value of the company s securities available for sale generally decreases and equity correspondingly decreases 
when rates decrease  fair value generally increases and shareholders equity correspondingly increases 
however  due to significant disruptions in global financial markets  such as those which occurred in  this usual relationship can be disrupted 
despite a generally declining interest rate environment since that time  certain of the company s available for sale securities specifically  its private label cmos from time to time have experienced fair values substantially less than amortized cost 
management expects continued volatility in the fair value of its private label cmos and is not able to predict when or if the fair value of such securities will fully recover 
wisconsin tax developments could reduce the company s net income like many wisconsin financial institutions  the company has established non wisconsin subsidiaries that hold and manage investment assets and loans  the income from which had not previously been subject to wisconsin tax prior to under a wisconsin department of revenue the department audit program specifically aimed at financial institutions out of state investment subsidiaries  the department has asserted the position that some or all of the income of the out of state subsidiaries in years prior to was taxable in wisconsin 
in the department s auditor issued a notice of proposed audit report to the bank which proposes to tax all of the income of the bank s out of state investment subsidiaries for all periods that are still open under the statute of limitations  which includes tax years back to this is a preliminary determination made by the auditor and does not represent a formal assessment 
the bank s outside legal counsel has met with representatives of the department to discuss  and object to  the auditor s proposed adjustments 
the department has requested further information to support the company s position  which the company has provided 
the company is awaiting a further response from the department 
management continues to believe that the bank has reported income and paid wisconsin taxes in prior periods in accordance with applicable legal requirements and the department s long standing interpretations of them and that the bank s position will prevail in discussions with the department  court proceedings  or other actions that may occur 
ultimately  however  an adverse resolution of these matters could result in additional wisconsin tax obligations for prior periods  which could have a substantial negative impact on the bank s earnings in the period such resolution is reached 
the bank may also incur further costs in the future to address and defend these issues 
strong competition within the company s market area may affect net income the company encounters strong competition both in attracting deposits and originating real estate and other loans 
the company competes with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
the company s market area includes branches of several commercial banks that are substantially larger than the company in terms of deposits and loans 
in addition  tax exempt credit unions operate in most of the company s market area and aggressively price their products and services to a large part of the population 
if competitors succeed in attracting business from the company s customers  its deposits and loans could be reduced  which would likely affect earnings 
developments in the marketplace  such as alternatives to traditional financial institutions  or adverse publicity could affect the company ongoing business changes in the marketplace are allowing consumers to use alternative means to complete financial transactions that previously had been conducted through banks 
for example  consumers can increasingly maintain funds in accounts other than bank deposits or through on line alternatives  or complete payment transactions without the assistance of banks 
continuation or acceleration of these trends  including newly developing means of communications and technology  could cause consumers to utilize fewer of the company services  which could have a material adverse affect on its results 
financial institutions such as the company are increasingly under governmental  media and other scrutiny as to the conduct of their businesses  and potential issues and adverse developments real and perceived are receiving widespread media attention 
if there were to be significant adverse publicity about the company  that publicity could affect its reputation in the marketplace 
if the company reputation is diminished  it could affect its business and results of operations as well as the price of the company common stock 
the company is subject to security risks and failures and operational risks relating to the use of technology that could damage its reputation and business security breaches in the company s internet  telephonic  or other electronic banking activities could expose it to possible liability and damage its reputation 
any compromise of the company s security also could deter customers from using its internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information 
the company relies on standard internet and other security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data 
these precautions may not protect the company s systems from compromises or breaches of its security measures  which could result in damage to the company s reputation and business and affect its results of operations 
additionally  as a financial institution  the company s business is data intensive 
beyond the inherent nature of a financial institution that requires it to process and track extremely large numbers of financial transactions and accounts  the company is required to collect and maintain significant data about its customers 
these operations require the company to obtain and maintain technology and security related systems that are mission critical to its business 
the company s failure to do so could significantly affect its ability to conduct business and its customers confidence in it 
further  the company outsources a large portion of its data processing to third parties 
if these third party providers encounter technological or other difficulties or if they have difficulty in communicating with the company  it will significantly affect the company s ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions  which would significantly affect business operations 
further  the technology affecting the financial institutions industry and consumer financial transactions is rapidly changing  with the frequent introduction of new products  services  and alternatives 
the future success of the company requires that it continue to adapt to these changes in technology to address its customers needs 
many of the company competitors have greater technological resources to invest in these improvements 
these changes could be costly to the company and if the company does not continue to offer the services and technology demanded by the marketplace  this failure to keep pace with change could materially affect its business  financial condition  and results of operation 
future fdic increases in deposit insurance premiums could increase the company s expenses in the fdic significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance and imposed a special assessment 
these measures were partly in response to the high level of bank failures which has caused an increase in fdic resolution costs and a reduction in the deposit insurance fund 
effective in april the fdic issued a new rule that changed the assessment base and risk based assessment rates of all insured financial institutions 
although this latest development benefited the company by lowering the total dollar amount of its fdic deposit insurance premiums  future changes in the assessment base and or rates  if any  may have an adverse affect on the earnings of the company 
the company s ability to grow may be limited if it cannot make acquisitions the company will continue to seek to expand its banking franchise by growing internally  acquiring other financial institutions or branches  acquiring other financial services providers  and opening new offices 
the company s ability to grow through selective acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches will depend on successfully identifying  acquiring  and integrating those institution or branches 
the company has not made any acquisitions in recent years  as management has not identified acquisitions for which it was able to reach an agreement on terms management believed were appropriate and or that met its acquisition criteria 
the company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to generate internal growth  identify attractive acquisition candidates  make acquisitions on favorable terms  or successfully integrate any acquired institutions or branches 
the company depends on certain key personnel and the company s business could be harmed by the loss of their services or the inability to attract other qualified personnel the company s success depends in large part on the continued service and availability of its management team  and on its ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the management team has been augmented to attempt to increase the company penetration into the commercial lending market 
the company may need to attract further talent in the future 
the competition for these individuals can be significant  and the loss of key personnel could harm the company s business 
the company cannot provide assurances that it will be able to retain existing key personnel or attract additional qualified personnel 
if the company is unable to maintain effective internal control over its financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of its financial statements  which could result in a reduction in the value of its common stock under the sarbanes oxley act  public companies must include a report of management regarding companies control over financial reporting in their annual reports and that report must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the companies internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm that audits a company financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
if the company is unable to maintain the required effective internal control over financial reporting  including in connection with regulatory changes and or changes in accounting rules and standards that apply to it  this could lead to a failure to meet its reporting obligations to the sec 
such a failure in turn could result in an adverse reaction to the company in the marketplace or a decline in value of the company common stock  due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company financial statements 
the cost to provide employee healthcare insurance and or benefits could increase in the future the affordable care act the aca  which was adopted in and is being phased in over several years  significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the united states 
it is possible that aca the will negatively affect the company s cost of providing health insurance and or benefits  and may also impact various other aspects of the company s business 
while the aca did not have a material impact on the company in  or  the company is continuing to assess the possible future impact of the aca on its health care benefit costs
