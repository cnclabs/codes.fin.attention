item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  appearing in item of this annual report on form k 
also  several of the matters discussed in this document contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements usually are denoted by words or phrases such as believes  expects  projects  estimates  anticipates  will likely result or similar expressions 
we wish to caution readers that all forward looking statements are necessarily speculative and not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made  and to advise readers that actual results could vary due to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns and allowances  doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when we have evidence of an arrangement  a determinable fee  and when collection is considered to be probable and products are delivered 
this occurs upon shipment of the merchandise  which is when legal transfer of title occurs 
reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns 
sales returns for the years ended december  and aggregated  and  respectively 
the allowance for sales returns and allowances and doubtful accounts at december  and aggregated  and  respectively 
we review the actual sales returns and bad debts for our customers and establish an estimate of future returns and an allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory  consisting principally of products held for resale  is recorded at the lower of cost determined using the first in first out method or estimated market value 
we had inventory balances in the amount of  and  at december  and  respectively  which is presented net of valuation allowances of  and  at december  and  respectively 
we evaluate inventories to identify excess  high cost  slow moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins 
due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories 
if our assumptions about future demand change  or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
our worldwide operations are subject to local laws and regulations 
as such  of particular interest is the european union eu directive relating to the restriction of certain hazardous substance rohs 
on july   this directive restricted the distribution of products within the eu containing certain substances  including lead 
at the present time  much of our inventory contains substances prohibited by the rohs directive 
further  many of our suppliers are not yet supplying rohs compliant products 
the legislation is effective and some of our inventory has become obsolete 
management has estimated the impact of the legislation and have written down or reserved for related inventories based on amounts expected to be realized given all available current information 
actual amounts realized from the ultimate disposition of related inventories could be different from those estimated 
deferred taxes we review the nature of each component of our deferred income taxes for reasonableness 
if determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which allowance will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
we also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and future taxable income in assessing if deferred tax assets could be realized 
we also consider the weight of both positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance is needed 
however  due to the continued net losses  we have fully reserved a  allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
recent accounting policies please see note of our financial statements that describe the impact  if any  from the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents overview we distribute discrete semiconductors  commodity integrated circuits ics  optoelectronic devices and passive components to other electronic distributors  cems and oems  who incorporate them in their products and supply odm products for our customer s multi year turn key projects 
we continue to be impacted by the severe decline in demand for discrete semiconductors from the us market  which began in late as a result  we have experienced declining sales in such components since early in response to this declining demand  we placed emphasis on increasing our sales to existing customers through further expansion of the number of different types of discrete components and other integrated circuits in our inventory and by attracting additional contract electronic manufacturers cems  original equipment manufacturers oems and electronics distributor customers 
in addition  over the last three years we have developed our odm service capabilities and added products developed through partnership agreements with offshore solution providers oems and cems 
our core strategy still includes maintaining a substantial inventory of electronic components that allows us to fill customer orders immediately from stock held in inventory 
however  we have included a non cash provision of approximately  during to increase our inventory reserves for price declines  non rohs compliant components and slow moving and excess inventory 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have classified inventory as a current asset in our december   consolidated financial statements representing approximately of current assets and of total assets 
however  if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated  the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset  such as cash 
we cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve 
therefore  it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result 
our gross profit margins are subject to a number of factors  including product demand  the relative strength of the us dollar  provisions for inventory reserves  our ability to purchase inventory at favorable prices and our sales product mix 
results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december net sales were  and  in and  respectively  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in net sales was primarily due to a domestic increase in demand for our products 
gross margins were  and  in and  respectively  which represented and of net sales for those periods 
the decrease of  was primarily attributed to the increase of our non cash provision for inventory reserves 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  in and  respectively  which represented and of net sales for those periods 
the decrease of  was primarily due to decreases in salaries and benefit expenses 
operating losses were  and  in and  respectively  which represented and of net sales for those periods 
operating losses increased due to our non cash provision for inventory reserves 
net interest expense was  and  for and  respectively 
the net decrease was due to interest income earned on our investments in securities in income tax provision was  in both periods and our tax provision is primarily based upon our state income tax liabilities 
we incurred net losses of  and  in and  respectively  which represented and of net sales for those periods 
net losses increased due to the increase in provision for inventory reserves 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations  short term commercial loans  subordinated promissory notes and issuance of equity securities 
a summary of our cash flows resulting from our operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  operating activities investing activities cash flows provided by operating activities increased to  during  as compared to  used in the prior year 
the increase in the use of cash was primarily attributed to inventory decreasing by  during cash flows used in investing activities decreased to  during  as compared to  in the prior year 
our investing outflows primarily came from investments in securities 
we believe that funds generated from operations  existing cash balances and short term loans  are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
if these funds are not sufficient  we may secure new sources of asset based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities 
otherwise  we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital 
inventory is included and classified as a current asset 
as of december   inventory represented approximately of current assets and of total assets 
however  it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not to be saleable within a one year time frame 
hence  inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets  such as cash 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no material off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are likely to have  a current or future material effect on our operations
