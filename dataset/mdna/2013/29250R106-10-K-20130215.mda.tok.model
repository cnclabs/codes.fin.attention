item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future prospects for natural gas 
competition 
competition from other pipeline companies is significant in all the markets we serve 
competitors of our gathering  treating and processing systems include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that gather  treat  process and market natural gas or ngls 
some of these competitors are substantially larger than we are 
competition for the services we provide varies based upon the location of gathering  treating and processing facilities 
most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering  treating and processing facilities available to them 
in addition  they have alternatives such as building their own gathering facilities or  in some cases  selling their natural gas supplies without treating and processing 
in addition to location  competition also varies based upon pricing arrangements and reputation 
on the sour natural gas systems  such as a component of our east texas system  competition is more limited in certain locations due to the infrastructure required to treat sour natural gas 
competition for customers in the marketing of residue natural gas is based primarily upon the price of the delivered natural gas  the services offered by the seller and the reliability of the seller in making deliveries 
residue natural gas also competes on a price basis with alternative fuels such as crude oil and coal  especially for customers that have the capability of using these alternative fuels  and on the basis of local environmental considerations 
competition in the marketing of ngls comes from other ngl marketing companies  producers  traders  chemical companies and other asset owners 
because pipelines are generally the only practical mode of transportation for natural gas over land  the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipelines 
pipelines typically compete with each other based on location  capacity  price and reliability 
many of the large wholesale customers we serve have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities 
accordingly  many of these customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines or third parties that may hold capacity on the various pipelines 
in addition  several new interstate natural gas pipelines have been and are being constructed in areas currently served by our natural gas pipeline systems 
some of these new pipelines may compete for customers with our existing pipelines 
trucking and ngl marketing operations we also include our trucking and ngl marketing operations in our natural gas segment 
these operations include the transportation of ngls  crude oil and other products by pipeline  truck and railcar from wellheads and treating  processing and fractionation facilities to wholesale customers  such as distributors  refiners and 
table of contents chemical facilities 
in addition  our trucking and ngl marketing operations resell these products 
a key component of our business is ensuring market access for the liquids extracted at our processing facilities 
on average  this accounts for approximately of the volumes marketed or transported by our trucking and ngl marketing business and is a major source of its growth in this area 
our services are provided using trucks  trailers and rail cars  pipeline capacity  fractionation agreements  product treating and handling equipment 
our trucking operations transport ngls  condensate and crude oil from our processing facilities and from third party producers to our united states gulf coast customers 
in october  we acquired the assets of a common carrier trucking company for million to meet the growing supply of ngls  condensate and crude oil  as well as to capitalize on the opportunity to better serve our united states gulf coast customers 
as a result of the acquisition  our fleet expanded in excess of trucks and in excess of trailers  as of december  ngl marketers 
most of the customers of our trucking and ngl marketing operations are wholesale customers  such as refineries and propane distributors 
our trucking and ngl marketing operations also market products to wholesale customers such as petrochemical plants 
supply and demand 
supply is sourced from a variety of areas in the united states gulf coast  with a significant amount of the ngl volume coming from our own gathering and processing facilities 
crude oil and natural gas prices and production levels affect the supply of these products 
the demand for our services is affected by the demand for ngls and crude oil by large industrial refineries and similar customers in the regions served by this business 
competition 
our trucking and ngl marketing operations have a number of competitors  including other trucking and railcar operations  pipelines  and  to a lesser extent  marine transportation and alternative fuels 
in addition  the marketing activities of our trucking and ngl marketing operations have numerous competitors  including marketers of all types and sizes  affiliates of pipelines and independent aggregators 
marketing segment our marketing segment s primary objectives are to maximize the value of the natural gas purchased by our gathering systems and the throughput on our gathering and intrastate wholesale customer pipelines and to mitigate financial risk 
to achieve this objective  our marketing segment transacts with various counterparties to provide natural gas supply  transportation  balancing  storage and sales services 
since our gathering and intrastate wholesale customer pipeline assets are geographically located within texas and oklahoma  the majority of activities conducted by our marketing segment are focused within these areas  or points downstream of these locations 
customers 
natural gas purchased by our marketing business is sold to industrial  utility and power plant end use customers 
in addition  gas is sold to marketing companies at various market hubs 
these sales are typically priced based upon a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to end use customers incorporate a pass through charge for costs of transportation and additional margin to compensate us for associated services 
supply and demand 
supply for our marketing business depends to a large extent on the natural gas reserves and rate of drilling within the areas served by our natural gas business 
demand is typically driven by weather related factors with respect to power plant and utility customers and industrial demand 
our marketing business uses third party storage capacity to balance supply and demand factors within its portfolio 
our marketing business pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase 
table of contents contracts and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
our marketing business leases third party pipeline capacity downstream from our natural gas assets under firm transportation contracts  which capacity is dependent on the volumes of natural gas from our natural gas assets 
this capacity is leased for various lengths of time and at rates that allow our marketing business to diversify its customer base by expanding its service territory 
additionally  this transportation capacity provides assurance that our natural gas will not be shut in  which can result from capacity constraints on downstream pipelines 
competition 
our marketing segment has numerous competitors  including large natural gas marketing companies  marketing affiliates of pipelines  major oil and natural gas producers  independent aggregators and regional marketing companies 
regulation regulation by the ferc of interstate common carrier liquids pipelines our lakehead  north dakota and ozark systems are our primary interstate common carrier liquids pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act  or ica  the energy policy act of  or ep act  and rules and orders promulgated thereunder 
as common carriers in interstate commerce  these pipelines provide service to any shipper who makes a reasonable request for transportation services  provided that the shipper satisfies the conditions and specifications contained in the applicable tariff 
the ica requires us to maintain tariffs on file with the ferc that set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines  as well as the rules and regulations governing these services 
the ica gives the ferc the authority to regulate the rates we can charge for service on interstate common carrier pipelines 
the ica requires  among other things  that such rates be just and reasonable and that they not be unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential to certain shippers 
the ica permits interested parties to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate the rates to determine if they are just and reasonable 
if the ferc finds the new or changed rate unlawful  it is authorized to require the carrier to refund  with interest  the amount of any revenues in excess of the amount that would have been collected during the term of the investigation at the rate properly determined to be lawful 
the ferc also may investigate  upon complaint or on its own motion  rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively 
upon an appropriate showing  a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint 
in october  congress passed the ep act  which deemed petroleum pipeline rates that were in effect for the day period ending on the date of enactment  or that were in effect on the th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint  protest or investigation during the day period  to be just and reasonable under the ica ie  grandfathered 
the ep act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates 
in order to challenge grandfathered rates  a party must show that it was contractually barred from challenging the rates during the relevant day period  that there has been a substantial change after the date of enactment of the ep act in the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services that were the basis for the rate  or that the rate is unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential 
the ferc determined our lakehead system rates are not covered by the grandfathering provisions of the ep act because they were subject to challenge prior to the effective date of the statute 
we believe that the rates for our north dakota and ozark systems in effect at the time of the ep act should be found to be subject to the grandfathering provisions of the ep act because those rates were not suspended or subject to protest or complaint during the day period established by the ep act 
the ep act required the ferc to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for petroleum pipelines and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings 
the ferc 
table of contents responded to this mandate by issuing order no 
which adopted an indexing rate methodology for petroleum pipelines 
under these regulations  which became effective january   petroleum pipelines are able to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index 
rate increases made within the ceiling levels may be protested  but such protests generally must show that the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline s increase in costs 
if the indexing methodology results in a reduced ceiling level that is lower than a pipeline s filed rate  order no 
requires the pipeline to reduce its rate to comply with the lower ceiling  although a pipeline is not required to reduce its rate below the level grandfathered under the ep act 
under order no 
 a pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates 
the ferc  however  uses cost of service ratemaking  market based rates and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach in certain specified circumstances 
the tariff rates for our ozark system are primarily set under the ferc indexing rules 
the tariff rates for our lakehead and north dakota systems are set using a combination of the ferc indexing rules which apply to the base rates on those systems and ferc approved surcharges for particular projects that were approved under the ferc s settlement rules 
under order no 
 the original inflation index adopted by the ferc for the period january through june was equal to the annual change in the producer price index for finished goods  or ppi fg  minus one percentage point 
the index is subject to review every five years 
for the period from july through june  the ferc set the index at the ppi fg without an upward or downward adjustment 
for the period from july through june  the ferc set the index at the ppi fg plus percentage points 
the index as of july  was negative  resulting in a general downward adjustment of petroleum pipeline rates as of that date 
on december   the ferc set the index for the period from july through june at ppi fg plus percentage points 
the ferc s december  order was challenged and an appeal was filed by a shipper with the d 
c circuit court 
however  on december   the shipper filed a motion requesting that the appeal be dismissed 
therefore no further judicial or commission review of the decision occurred 
the index as of july  resulted in an increase of approximately to the lakehead  ozark and north dakota portion of their indexed rates 
a shipper filed a protest  challenging the proposed increase to the lakehead rates arguing that lakehead was not entitled to the increase 
the commission dismissed the protest and the lakehead rates  as filed  are in effect 
ferc allowance for income taxes in interstate common carrier pipeline rates in may  the ferc adopted a policy statement providing that pipelines regulated by ferc that are owned by entities organized as master limited partnerships  or mlps  could include an income tax allowance in their cost of service rates to the extent the income generated from regulated activities was subject to an actual or potential income tax liability 
pursuant to this policy statement  a ferc regulated pipeline that is a tax pass through entity seeking such an income tax allowance must establish that its owners  partners or members have an actual or potential income tax obligation on the company s income from regulated activities 
this tax allowance policy was upheld on appeal by the u 
s 
court of appeals for the dc circuit  also referred to as the dc circuit court  in may whether a particular pipeline s owners have an actual or potential income tax liability is reviewed by the ferc on a case by case basis 
to the extent any of our ferc regulated oil pipeline systems were to file cost of service rates  their entitlement to an income tax allowance would be assessed under the ferc policy statement and the facts existing at the relevant time 
ferc return on equity policy for oil pipelines on april   the ferc issued a policy statement regarding the inclusion of mlps in the proxy groups used to determine the return on equity  or roe  for oil pipelines 
composition of proxy groups for determining gas and oil pipeline return on equity  ferc   rehearing denied  ferc 
table of contents  
no petitions for review of the policy statement were filed with the dc circuit court 
the policy statement largely upheld the prior method by which roes were calculated for oil pipelines  explaining that mlps should continue to be included in the roe proxy group for oil pipelines  and that there should be no ceiling on the level of distributions included in the ferc s current discounted cash flow  or dcf  methodology 
the policy statement further indicated that the institutional brokers estimate system  or ibes  forecasts should remain the basis for the short term growth forecast used in the dcf calculation and there should be no modification to the current respective two thirds and one third weightings of the short and long term growth factors 
the primary change to the prior roe methodology was the policy statement s holding that the gross domestic product  or gdp  forecast used for the long term growth rate should be reduced by for all mlps included in the proxy group 
everything else being equal  that change will result in somewhat lower roes for oil pipelines than would have been calculated under the prior roe methodology 
the actual roes to be calculated under the new policy statement  however  are dependent on the companies included in the proxy group and the specific conditions existing at the time the roe is calculated in each case 
accounting for pipeline assessment costs in june  the ferc issued an order in docket ai describing how ferc regulated companies should account for costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the united states department of transportation  or dot  and the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration  or phmsa 
the order took effect on january  under the order  ferc regulated companies are generally required to recognize costs incurred for performing pipeline assessments that are part of a pipeline integrity management program as a maintenance expense in the period in which the costs are incurred 
costs for items such as rehabilitation projects designed to extend the useful life of the system can continue to be capitalized to the extent permitted under the existing rules 
the ferc denied rehearing of its accounting guidance order on september  prior to  we capitalized first time in line inspection programs  based on previous rulings by the ferc 
in january  we began expensing all first time internal inspection costs for all our pipeline systems  whether or not they are subject to the ferc s regulation  on a prospective basis 
we continue to expense secondary internal inspection tests consistent with the previous practice 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies included in our consolidated financial statements beginning at page of this annual report on form k for additional discussion 
regulation by the ferc of intrastate natural gas pipelines our operations in texas are subject to regulation under the texas utilities code and the texas natural resources code  as implemented by the texas railroad commission  or trrc 
generally  the trrc is vested with authority to ensure that rates charged for natural gas sales and transportation services are just and reasonable 
the rates we charge for transportation services are deemed just and reasonable under texas law  unless challenged in a complaint 
we cannot predict whether such a complaint may be filed against us or whether the trrc will change its method of regulating rates 
the texas natural resources code provides that an informal complaint process that is conducted by the texas railroad commission shall apply to any rate issues associated with gathering or transmission systems  thus subjecting the intrastate pipeline activities of enbridge to the jurisdiction of the texas railroad commission via its informal complaint process 
our texas and oklahoma intrastate pipelines are generally not subject to regulation by the ferc 
however  to the extent our intrastate pipelines transport natural gas in interstate commerce  the rates  terms and conditions of such transportation are subject to ferc jurisdiction under section of the natural gas policy act  or ngpa 
in addition  under ferc regulations we are subject to market manipulation and transparency rules 
this includes the public posting of certain contract information pursuant to ferc order no 
et al 

table of contents natural gas gathering regulation section b of the natural gas act  or nga  exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the ferc 
we own certain natural gas facilities that we believe meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a facility s status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction 
however  to the extent our gathering systems buy and sell natural gas  such gatherers  in their capacity as buyers and sellers of natural gas  are now subject to ferc order a 
additionally  several of our gathering systems fall under the definition of major non interstate pipeline 
these systems were previously subject to ferc order no 
et al  however on october  the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit issued an opinion vacating the ferc rule rm promulgated by order nos 
and a  which required major intrastate pipelines to post their system s flow information 
the fifth circuit entered its final mandate on december  in keeping with that mandate  enbridge ceased posting of capacity and flow information for its major intrastate pipelines on january  state regulations of gathering facilities typically address the safety and environmental concerns involved in the design  construction  installation  testing and operation of gathering facilities 
in addition  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory requirements are also addressed  however  historically rates have not fallen under the purview of state regulations for gathering facilities 
also  some states have  or are considering providing  greater regulatory scrutiny over the commercial regulation of the natural gas gathering business 
many of the producing states have previously adopted some form of complaint based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access or perceived rate discrimination 
our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to significant and unduly burdensome state or federal regulation of rates and services 
sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids the price at which we sell natural gas currently is not subject to federal or state regulation except for certain systems in texas 
our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability  terms and cost of pipeline transportation 
as noted above  the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry  most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies that remain subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
these initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances 
the stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and to facilitate price transparency in markets for the wholesale sale of physical natural gas 
our sales of crude oil  condensate and ngls currently are not regulated and are made at market prices 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to the ferc s jurisdiction under the ica 
certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could increase the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other marketers of these products 
other regulation the governments of the united states and canada have  by treaty  agreed to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment for the passage of oil and natural gas through the pipelines of one country across the territory of the other 
individual international border crossing points require united states government permits that may be terminated or amended at the discretion of the united states government 
these permits provide that pipelines may be inspected by or subject to orders issued by federal or state government agencies 

table of contents tariffs and transportation rate cases lakehead system under the published rate tariff as of december  for transportation on the lakehead system  the rates for transportation of light  medium and heavy crude oil from the international border near neche  north dakota and from clearbrook  minnesota to principal delivery points are set forth below published transportation rate per barrel light medium heavy from international border near neche  north dakota to clearbrook  minnesota to superior  wisconsin to chicago  illinois area to marysville  michigan area to buffalo  new york area clearbrook  minnesota to chicago pursuant to ferc tariff no 

as filed with the ferc and with an effective date of july  converted from m to bbl 
the transportation rates as of december  for medium and heavy crude oil are higher than the transportation rates for light crude oil set forth in this table to compensate for differences in the costs of shipping different types and grades of liquid hydrocarbons 
the lakehead system periodically adjusts transportation rates as allowed under the ferc s index methodology and the tariff agreements described below 
base rates the base portion of the transportation rates for our lakehead system are subject to an annual adjustment  which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the ferc and are determined in compliance with the ferc approved index methodology 
settlement agreement on december   the ferc issued an order in docket no 
or approving an uncontested settlement agreement  referred to as the settlement agreement  between us and capp with respect to three agreed upon changes to our lakehead system s rates a surcharge to recover costs of an expansion project known as the system expansion program phase ii  or sep ii  a surcharge to recover costs of the terrace expansion program  and an increase in the surcharge for heavy petroleum to reflect a change in lakehead s operating capability to transport heavier grades of petroleum 
sep ii surcharge under the settlement agreement with capp that the ferc approved in and reconfirmed in  lakehead implemented a transportation rate surcharge related to sep ii 
this surcharge  which is added to the base transportation rates  is a cost of service based calculation that is trued up annually usually in april for actual costs and throughput from the previous calendar year and is not subject to indexing 
the initial term of the sep ii portion of the settlement agreement was for years  beginning in and expiring december  
table of contents terrace surcharge under the settlement agreement  the lakehead system implemented a transportation rate surcharge for the terrace expansion program which is referred to as the terrace surcharge  of approximately per barrel for light crude oil from the canadian border to chicago and will remain at this level through  when the terrace surcharge ends 
in addition to the terrace surcharge  included in the tariff agreement are the terrace schedule b and c adjustments 
the schedule b adjustment to the terrace surcharge is required if the current multi pipeline cost of equity exceeds the multi pipeline rate of return by plus or minus basis points 
in  since the current multi pipeline rate of return plus or minus basis points was less than the multi pipeline rate of return  an adjustment to the terrace surcharge was made 
the schedule c adjustment to the terrace surcharge is required when terrace phase iii facilities are in service and the annual actual average pumping exiting clearbrook is less than  cubic meters  or m  per day 
in the surcharge filing  the actual annual average pumping for was slightly below the volume threshold 
however  no adjustment was made to the terrace surcharge 
facilities surcharge in june  the ferc approved an offer of settlement in docket no 
or between the lakehead system and capp  for a facilities surcharge to be implemented separately from and incrementally to the then existing surcharges in its tariff rates  which we refer to as the facilities surcharge 
enbridge energy  limited partnership  ferc  
the facilities surcharge was intended to be utilized to include additional projects negotiated and agreed upon between the lakehead system and capp as a transparent  cost of service based tariff mechanism 
this allows the lakehead system to recover the costs associated with particular shipper requested projects through an incremental surcharge layered on top of the existing base rates and other ferc approved surcharges already in effect 
the facilities surcharge mechanism  or fsm  settlement requires the lakehead system to adjust the facilities surcharge annually to reflect the latest estimates for the upcoming year and to true up the difference between estimates and actual cost and throughput data in the prior year 
the ferc permitted the facilities surcharge to take effect as of july   and the fsm was expressly designed to be open ended 
in its approval of the fsm settlement  the commission accepted the lakehead system s proposal to submit for commission review and approval future agreements resulting from negotiations with capp where the parties have agreed that recovery of costs through the facilities surcharge is desirable and appropriate 
at the time the fsm was initially established  four projects were included in the facilities surcharge the griffith hartsdale transfer lines project  the hartsdale tanks project  the superior manifold modification project  and the line toledo expansion project 
on august   the ferc approved an amendment to the fsm settlement to allow the lakehead system to include in the facilities surcharge particular shipper requested projects that are not yet in service as of april st of each year  provided there is an annual true up of throughput and cost estimates 
enbridge energy  limited partnership  ferc  
the ferc also approved the addition of four new projects to the facilities surcharge docket no 
or southern access mainline expansion  tank at superior terminal and tank at griffith terminal  
table of contents clearbrook manifold  and tank at superior terminal and tank at griffith terminal 
on august   the ferc accepted the supplement to the settlement docket no 
or to allow the following three new projects southern lights replacement capacity project  eastern access trailbreaker backstopping agreement  and line expansion backstopping agreement 
on march   the ferc accepted the supplement to the settlement docket no 
or to permit the recovery of the costs associated with two new projects alberta clipper pipeline  and line conversion project 
on march   the ferc accepted the supplement to the settlement docket no 
or to permit the recovery of the costs associated with one new project line b integrity program 
on march   the ferc accepted the supplement to the settlement docket no 
or to permit the recovery of the costs associated with two new projects line b pipeline replacement and dig program project  and griffith terminal expansion project 
the line b pipeline replacement and dig program project  or project above  consists of two parts a 
the first is a pipeline replacement which is designed to recover an estimated million in capital cost  including contingency  escalation and allowance for funds used during construction  or afudc 
the project includes the replacement of five mile sections of pipe downstream of the pump station between griffith and stockbridge and one mile segment of pipe downstream of stockbridge 
b 
the second is a dig program which permits enbridge to recover the average capital cost per dig undertaken in for digs in excess of digs per year 
these costs are to be included in the facilities surcharge for a dig program involves rehabilitation of sections of pipeline to extend its useful life  and lessen the potential for a pipeline release 
the griffith terminal expansion project  or project above  is designed to recover an estimated million in capital cost  including contingency and market escalation 
enbridge energy and capp have agreed that the costs associated with line b replacement and dig program project and griffith terminal expansion project should be recovered through the fsm 
since the filing was uncontested  the commission accepted the supplement to the settlement on the grounds that it is fair  reasonable  and in the public interest 

table of contents on february   the ferc accepted the supplement to the settlement docket no 
or to permit the recovery of the costs associated with two more projects flanagan tank replacement project  and eastern access phase mainline expansion project 
the flanagan tank replacement project  or project above  has an overall estimated capital cost of million and includes the replacement of two out of service tanks with two new tanks 
the eastern access phase mainline expansion  or project above  has an overall estimated capital cost of billion which is a decrease from the filing of billion  including contingency  market escalation  and afudc 
it has three main components a 
the line mainline expansion will provide an additional  bpd of light crude oil capacity on line from superior  wisconsin to sarnia  ontario  at an estimated capital cost of million  which is an increase from the filing of million 
the quoted annual capacity of line is  bpd  b 
the line spearhead north expansion involves adding two new pump stations and one new  barrel tank in flanagan  illinois  which will provide an additional  bpd of capacity on line between flanagan  illinois and hartsdale  indiana  at an estimated capital cost of million  which is an increase from the filing of million  and c 
the line b replacement involves installation of miles of inch pipeline from griffith  indiana to stockbridge  michigan 
this upsized pipeline will provide an additional  bpd of capacity on that line segment at an estimated capital cost of billion  which is a decrease from the filing of billion 
as of december   the facilities surcharge was per barrel for light crude oil movements from the international border near neche  north dakota to chicago  illinois 
other tariff and transportation rate cases on may   pbf holding company llc and toledo refining company llc pbf filed a complaint with the ferc alleging that enbridge energy  limited partnership enbridge was discriminating against light crude shippers in favor of heavy crude shippers by failing to move light sour crude from line to line to equalize apportionment on the two lines 
in its complaint  pbf sought damages under section of the interstate commerce act for the allegedly unlawful apportionment procedures and practices of enbridge 
the damage claim portion of the pbf complaint is redacted  so an estimate of damages cannot be provided 
on june   enbridge filed a motion to dismiss and answer to the pbf complaint  stating that it has operated its pipelines in this manner for the past years and that enbridge believes its current method is the fairest manner to allocate capacity  maximize utilization and take into account the differences between grades of crude 
pbf filed an answer to enbridge on june   and enbridge filed a further reply on july   re stating that this is a long held practice and to order it to be changed would have negative consequences on other shippers 
on august   ferc set the matter for hearing  first ordering a settlement process 
the first settlement meeting was september  the second settlement meeting was held on november   at which time enbridge and pbf expressed that they were unable to settle the matter 
on november   the settlement judge issued an order terminating the settlement process and appointing an administrative law judge for the hearing 
the case is on a track iii schedule  meaning the hearing will commence within weeks ie  by september   and the initial decision must be issued within weeks ie  by january 

table of contents high prairie pipelines llc  a subsidiary of saddle butte pipeline  llc high prairie  filed a complaint with the ferc on may   claiming that enbridge unduly discriminated against high prairie by failing to provide high prairie a connection at the enbridge clearbrook terminal 
enbridge formally denied the accusation in a motion to dismiss on june   submitting that ferc does not have the authority to force a pipeline connection 
high prairie filed its answer on june   alleging that enbridge misstated the facts and the law 
enbridge filed its response on july   reiterating that the law is clear and that high prairie is trying to obfuscate that fact by focusing on its version of the facts 
high prairie filed a further response on july  a ferc decision has not yet been issued 
on october   enbridge filed ferc tariff no 
canceling ferc tariff no 
the proposed tariff revises enbridge s downstream nomination verification procedure in enbridge s rules and regulations tariff by eliminating a frozen month historical period and substituting it with the capability of the delivery facility to receive volumes from enbridge 
a number of shippers filed protests against the proposed tariff and several other shippers filed motions to intervene in the proceeding 
on november   enbridge filed a response to the motions to intervene and protest  stating it would not be opposed to ferc suspending the tariff for up to seven months and holding a technical conference at which to address the shipper concerns 
on december   ferc issued an order accepting and suspending tariff and establishing a technical conference 
the first technical conference session will likely be held at ferc on february  international joint tariff ferc tariff no 
 issued may   revised the international joint tariff  or ijt  effective july   by increasing the transportation tolls by and including a credit for the line claim of per cubic meter for movements of heavy crude from hardisty  alberta to the us border near gretna  manitoba 
the ijt provides rates applicable to the transportation of petroleum from all receipt points in western canada on the enbridge pipelines canadian mainline system to all delivery points on the lakehead pipeline system owned by enbridge energy and to delivery points on the canadian mainline located downstream of the lakehead system 
in summary  the ijt provides a simplified tolling structure to cover transportation services that cross the international border and provides a rate that is equal to or less than the sum of the combined canadian mainline and lakehead system rates on file and in effect 
mid continent system our ozark system is comprised of pipeline  terminaling and storage infrastructure located in the mid continent region of the united states 
specifically  the system originates in cushing and offers transportation service to wood river  and other mid continent system facilities  local area refineries and to other interconnected non affiliated pipelines 
the transportation rate for light crude oil from cushing to principal delivery points are set forth below published transportation rate per barrel to wood river transfer charge at cushing pursuant to ferc tariff no 
as filed with the ferc on may   with an effective date of july  pursuant to ferc tariff no 
as filed with the ferc on may   with an effective date of july  the transportation rates as of december   outlined above  apply to light crude only 
medium and heavy crude oil transportation rates on these systems are higher to compensate for differences in the costs of shipping different types and grades of liquid hydrocarbons 
where applicable  transportation rates are periodically adjusted as allowed under the ferc s index methodology 
this methodology allows for an adjustment of transportation rates effective july of each year 

table of contents north dakota system the north dakota system consists of both gathering and trunkline assets 
effective january   two new surcharges were implemented as a part of the north dakota phase expansion program  referred to as north dakota phase in august  the north dakota system submitted the phase offer of settlement to the ferc for an expansion of the system  which was approved by the commission on october  docket no 
or 
the phase offer of settlement outlined the mainline expansion and looping surcharges as cost of service based surcharges that are trued up each year to actual costs and volumes and are not subject to the ferc index methodology 
these surcharges were initially applicable for five years immediately following the in service date of north dakota phase  which was january the mainline expansion surcharge is applied to all routes with a destination of clearbrook and the looping surcharge is applied to volumes originating at either trenton or alexander  north dakota 
effective april   we extended the term of the looping surcharge on our north dakota system by four years  ending on december  rather than the original date of december  the impact of the term extension reduced the looping surcharge substantially thereby moderating the rate impact on shippers 
on january   enbridge north dakota submitted an offer of settlement to the ferc to facilitate the phase expansion of the north dakota system 
under the terms of the settlement  which were approved by the ferc on october  docket no 
or  expansion costs are recovered through a cost of service based surcharge on all shipments to clearbrook  minnesota 
the surcharge is in effect for seven years and is trued up on an annual basis to actual costs and volumes 
it is not subject to the ferc index methodology 
the phase surcharge became effective on january  and is in addition to existing base rates and the phase surcharges 
on august   the north dakota system and enbridge pipelines bakken lp filed a petition for declaratory order seeking the approval of priority service for the north dakota portion of the bakken project as well as the overall tariff and rate structure for the united states portions of the program 
the petition for declaratory order was approved by the ferc on november  ferc docket no 
or 
on january   the north dakota system filed an amendment to its rules and regulations in order to enhance and clarify the quality specifications contained within the tariff to be effective february  the tariff established new volumetric penalties for sulfur  api gravity  and basic sediment and water 
in response to a protest that was filed  the commission rejected the tariff on the basis that enbridge north dakota had not provided evidence to support the need for and the levels of the proposed penalties 
on february   notice was provided by the north dakota system of the extension of the temporary  partial embargo for deliveries to clearbrook  minnesota from the berthold  north dakota receipt point due to vibration issues that had occurred at berthold 
initial notice of the temporary  partial embargo was provided on october  on march   the north dakota system filed to provide notice of the lifting of the temporary  partial embargo  to establish an initial rate for a gathering service at alexander and to incorporate an updated calculation of the surcharges on the two previously approved phase and expansions 
the tariff went into effect april  on may   the north dakota system amended its rules and regulations tariff by implementing a revised mid month call for crude process 
the tariff went into effect july  on august   the north dakota system amended its rules and regulations tariff to modify its prorationing policy 
two years prior  on august   the north dakota system amended its rules and regulations tariff by implementing a temporary month freeze on the creation of additional regular shippers 
the change was intended to eliminate further proliferation of new shippers and mitigate the erosion of regular 
table of contents shipper capacity on the system 
during the month period commencing on october   shippers that had not yet attained regular shipper status as of that date were no longer permitted to become regular shippers until the later of i the date on which that shipper has transported crude oil during nine of the previous months or ii a month in which the system as a whole is not in apportionment 
the north dakota system s rules and regulations tariff was approved by the ferc order ferc  issued on september  docket no 
is 
with the temporary month freeze set to expire  a new tariff filed on august  intended to provide relief for all new shippers who had been frozen in the new shipper class during the freeze  but had developed sufficient history to qualify as a regular shipper 
north dakota intended to do this by allowing all qualifying shippers to achieve regular shipper status and then reserving less than of capacity for new shippers under the condition that any future expansions of capacity to clearbrook  minnesota would solely benefit new shippers until such time as their access to capacity totaled at least of the total available capacity to clearbrook 
notwithstanding a protest that was filed  the commission accepted the tariff effective september  on august   the north dakota system filed to establish initial gathering and truck unloading services and charges at alexander  north dakota and tioga  north dakota 
the two bbl interconnection rates resulted from shippers requests for pipeline interconnections with two shippers to facilitate receipts into enbridge north dakota at alexander and tioga 
the tariff became effective october  on november   the north dakota system submitted a petition for declaratory order seeking approval of a related offer of settlement with respect to a major expansion and extension of the north dakota system known as the sandpiper project 
the project will result in a substantial increase in the capacity available to transport bakken crude both to and through clearbrook  north dakota to superior  wisconsin 
the terms of the proposal include  among other things  the addition of a cost of service rate surcharge to the existing rates to clearbrook  and a new cost of service tariff rate from clearbrook to superior 
six protests of the project were filed with the ferc  to which enbridge responded on november   reaffirming the benefits of the sandpiper project and the support it has received from a cross section of shippers  including who signed the offer of settlement 
at the time of this filing our petition for declaratory order process is ongoing 
in the first quarter of  the bakken project will go into service and will transport  bpd of bakken crude from the north dakota system to cromer  manitoba  canada

as filed with the ferc on august   with an effective date of october  the looping surcharge was modified in to extend the cost recovery period by an additional four years  which reduced the rates 
safety regulation and environmental general our transmission and gathering pipelines  storage and processing facilities  trucking and railcar operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental  operational and safety regulation 
the added costs imposed by regulations are generally no different than those imposed on our competitors 
the failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties and or enforcement actions and added operational costs 
pipeline safety and transportation regulation our transmission and gathering pipelines are subject to regulation by the dot and phmsa  under title of the united states code of federal regulations parts pipeline safety act  or psa relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of transmission and gathering pipeline facilities 
phmsa is the agency charged with regulating the safe transportation of hazardous materials 
table of contents under all modes of transportation  including interstate and intrastate pipelines 
periodically the psa has been reauthorized and amended  imposing new mandates on the regulator to promulgate new regulations and imposing direct mandates on operators of pipelines 
on december   the pipeline inspection  protection  enforcement and safety act of  referred to as pipes of  was enacted  which further amended the psa 
many of the provisions were welcomed  including strengthening excavation damage prevention and enforcement 
the most significant provisions of pipes of that affect us include a mandate to phmsa to remove most exemptions from federal regulations for liquid pipelines operating at low stress and mandates phmsa to undertake rulemaking requiring pipeline operators to have a human factors management plan for pipeline control room personnel  including consideration for controlling hours of service 
on december   the final rule for the control room management human factors was published and in june  the rule s implemental deadlines were expedited in order to realize the safety benefits sooner than established in the original rule 
the final rule applying safety regulations to all rural onshore hazardous liquid low stress pipelines was published may  and became effective october  in april  as a reaction to recent significant accidents involving natural gas explosions and hazardous liquids releases  the us department of transportation secretary ray lahood and phmsa issued a call to action to engage all the state pipeline regulatory agencies  technical and subject matter experts  and pipeline operators to accelerate the repair  rehabilitation  and replacement of the highest risk pipeline infrastructure 
the call addresses many concerns related to pipeline safety  such as ensuring pipeline operators know the age and condition of their pipelines  proposing new regulations to strengthen reporting and inspection requirements  and making information about pipelines and the safety record of pipeline operators easily accessible to the public 
in order to further strengthen pipeline safety regulations  the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty  and job creation act of was signed into law on january  as a result of this act  phmsa will be finalizing new rules to implement lessons learned from recent pipeline accidents 
pending legislation includes requiring automatic or remote controlled shutoff valves on new or replaced transmission pipeline facilities and requiring operators to use leak detection systems where practicable 
in addition  to support phmsa s investigation and enforcement operations for the increasing number of regulations  the act authorizes additional phmsa inspectors  and doubles the maximum civil penalties for pipeline operators who fail to observe safety rules 
also included within this act are the consideration of expanding integrity management requirements beyond high consequence areas  the assessment of the need for new regulations covering diluted bitumen transportation  the requirement to validate and verify maximum allowable operating pressures  and the determination of the effect of depth of cover over buried pipelines in accidental releases of hazardous liquids at water crossings 
we have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines  and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets 
we expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs  based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above 
in addition to regulatory changes  costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity transported by our system  or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs 
when hydrocarbons are released into the environment or violations identified during an inspection  phmsa may issue a civil penalty or enforcement action  which can require internal inspections  pipeline pressure reductions and other methods to manage or verify the integrity of a pipeline in the affected area 
in addition  the national transportation safety board may perform an investigation of a significant accident to determine the probable cause and issue safety recommendations to prevent future accidents 
any release that results in an enforcement action  or national transportation safety board  or ntsb  investigation  such as those associated with line b near marshall  mi and line near grand marsh  wi could have a material impact on system throughput or compliance costs 
for example  the marshall release resulted in a record million civil penalty 
table of contents and multiple recommendations from the resultant ntsb investigation 
as part of the corrective action order related to the grand marsh release  we were required to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to address wide ranging safety initiatives for not only line  but for our entire lakehead system 
we believe that our pipeline  trucking and railcar operations are in substantial compliance with applicable operational and safety requirements 
in instances of non compliance  we have taken actions to remediate the situations 
nevertheless  significant operating expenses and capital expenditure could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the capabilities of our current pipeline control system or other safety equipment 
environmental regulation general 
our operations are subject to complex federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment  including laws and regulations that govern the handling  storage and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials or emissions from natural gas compression facilities 
as with the pipeline and processing industry in general  complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities 
while these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income  we believe that they do not affect our competitive position since the operations of our competitors are generally similarly affected 
in addition to compliance costs  violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal fines and penalties and  in some instances  injunctions banning or delaying certain activities 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
there are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations  such as releases or spills of crude oil  liquids  natural gas or other substances from our pipelines or storage facilities 
such accidental releases could  to the extent not insured  subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines  penalties or damages for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
although we are entitled  in certain circumstances  to indemnification from third parties for environmental liabilities relating to assets we acquired from those parties  these contractual indemnification rights are limited  and accordingly  we may be required to bear substantial environmental expenses 
however  we believe that through our due diligence process  we identify and manage substantial issues 
air and water emissions 
our operations are subject to the federal clean air act  or caa  and the federal clean water act  or cwa  and comparable state and local statutes 
we anticipate  therefore  that we will incur costs in the next several years for air pollution control equipment and spill prevention measures in connection with maintaining existing facilities and obtaining permits and approvals for any new or acquired facilities 
in january  the environmental protection agency  or epa  published that the effective date of the spill prevention  control  and countermeasures rule amendments would be november  however  on october   the epa issued an extension to the compliance date to november  while the operations of our pipeline facilities are subject to the rule  we prepared the necessary plans for compliance prior to the november effective date 
in  the epa published the greenhouse gas recordkeeping and reporting rule  which requires applicable facilities to record and report greenhouse gas emissions from combustion sources beginning january  as a part of the reporting rule  in november  the epa published the requirements for reporting emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems beginning january  while the operations of our pipelines are subject to the rule  we do not believe that the rule requirements will have a material effect on our operations 
annual emissions from combustion activities in 
table of contents were reported prior to the september  deadline 
facilities subject to existing greenhouse gas reporting rules reported emissions prior to the march  deadline for emissions 
facilities subject to the new reporting rules in reported emissions prior to the september  deadline 
on august   the epa proposed new source performance standards nsps  subpart oooo  for volatile organic compounds  or voc  and sulfur dioxide  or so  emissions from the oil and natural gas sector 
the final standards were published and became effective on august  the compliance dates range from october   to october   dependent on the affected equipment 
there will be additional costs across the industry to attain compliance with the nsps  subpart oooo  but we do not expect a material effect on our financial statements 
the oil pollution act  or opa  was enacted in and amends parts of the cwa and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to oil spills 
under the opa  we could be subject to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill from our facilities into navigable waters  along shorelines or in an exclusive economic zone of the united states 
the opa also imposes certain spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements for many of our non pipeline facilities  such as the preparation of detailed oil spill emergency response plans and the construction of dikes or other containment structures to prevent contamination of navigable or other waters in the event of an oil overflow  rupture or release 
for our liquid pipeline facilities  the opa imposes requirements for emergency plans to be prepared  submitted and approved by the dot 
for our non transportation facilities  such as storage tanks that are not integral to pipeline transportation system  the opa regulations are promulgated by the epa 
we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations 
hazardous substances and waste management 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla also known as the superfund law and similar state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons  including the owners or operators of waste disposal sites and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
we may generate some wastes that fall within the definition of a hazardous substance 
we may  therefore  be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of any costs required to clean up and restore sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
analogous state laws may apply to a broader range of substances than cercla and  in some instances  may offer fewer exemptions from liability 
we have not received any notification that we may be potentially responsible for material cleanup costs under cercla or similar state laws 
site remediation 
we own and operate a number of pipelines  gathering systems  storage facilities and processing facilities that have been used to transport  distribute  store and process crude oil  natural gas and other petroleum products 
many of our facilities were previously owned and operated by third parties whose handling  disposal and release of petroleum and waste materials were not under our control 
the age of the facilities  combined with the past operating and waste disposal practices  which were standard for the industry and regulatory regime at the time  have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some facilities due to historical spills and releases 
such contamination is not unusual within the natural gas and petroleum industry 
historical contamination found on  under or originating from our properties may be subject to cercla  the resource conservation recovery act and analogous state laws as described above 
under these laws  we could incur substantial expense to remediate such contamination  including contamination caused by prior owners and operators 
in addition  enbridge management  as the entity with managerial responsibility for us  could also be liable for such costs to the extent that we are unable to fulfill our obligations 
we have conducted site investigations at some of our facilities to assess historical environmental issues  and we are currently addressing soil and groundwater contamination at various facilities through remediation and monitoring programs  with oversight by the applicable governmental agencies where appropriate 

table of contents employees neither we nor enbridge management have any employees 
our general partner has delegated to enbridge management  pursuant to a delegation of control agreement  substantially all of the responsibility for our day to day management and operation 
our general partner  however  retains certain functions and approval rights over our operations 
to fulfill its management obligations  enbridge management has entered into agreements with enbridge and several of its affiliates to provide enbridge management with the necessary services and support personnel who act on enbridge management s behalf as its agents 
we are ultimately responsible for reimbursing these service providers based on the costs that they incur in performing these services 
insurance our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the liquid petroleum and natural gas gathering  treating  processing and transportation industry 
we maintain commercial liability insurance coverage that is consistent with coverage considered customary for our industry 
we are included in the comprehensive insurance program that is maintained by enbridge for its subsidiaries through the policy renewal date of may  the insurance coverage also includes property insurance coverage on our assets  except pipeline assets that are not located at water crossings  including earnings interruption resulting from an insurable event 
in the unlikely event multiple insurable incidents occur which exceed coverage limits within the same insurance period  the total insurance coverage will be allocated among the enbridge entities on an equitable basis based on an insurance allocation agreement the partnership has entered into with enbridge and another enbridge subsidiary 
the coverage limits and deductible amounts at december  for our insurance policies insurance type coverage limits deductible amount in millions property and business interruption up to general liability up to pollution liability up to we can make no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain will be available or adequate for any particular risk or loss or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
although we believe that our assets are adequately covered by insurance  a substantial uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
taxation we are not a taxable entity for us federal income tax purposes 
generally  us federal and state income taxes on our taxable income are borne by our individual partners through the allocation of our taxable income 
in a limited number of states  an income tax is imposed upon us and generally  not our individual partners 
the income tax that we bear is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the allocation of taxable income to our individual partners may vary substantially from net income reported in our consolidated statements of income

table of contents item a 
risk factors we encourage you to read the risk factors below in connection with the other sections of this annual report on form k 
risks related to our business our actual construction and development costs could exceed our forecast  and our cash flow from construction and development projects may not be immediate  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase cash distributions 
our strategy contemplates significant expenditures for the development  construction or other acquisition of energy infrastructure assets 
the construction of new assets involves numerous regulatory  environmental  legal  political  materials and labor cost and operational risks that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
as a result  we may not be able to complete our projects at the costs currently estimated or within the time periods we have projected 
if we experience material cost overruns  we will have to finance these overruns using one or more of the following methods using cash from operations  delaying other planned projects  incurring additional indebtedness  or issuing additional equity 
any or all of these methods may not be available when needed or may adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 
our revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately on our expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for example  if we build a new pipeline or expand an existing facility  the design  construction  development and installation may occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increase in revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service and customers begin using the systems 
if our revenues and cash flow do not increase at projected levels because of substantial unanticipated delays or other factors  we may not meet our obligations as they become due  and we may need to reduce or reprioritize our capital budget  sell non strategic assets  access the capital markets or reassess our level of distributions to unitholders to meet our capital requirements 
our ability to access capital markets and credit on attractive terms to obtain funding for our capital projects and acquisitions may be limited 
our ability to fund our capital projects and make acquisitions depends on whether we can access the necessary financing to fund these activities 
domestic and international economic conditions affect the functioning of capital markets and the availability of credit 
adverse economic conditions  such as those prevalent during the recessionary period of and through much of  periodically result in weakness and volatility in the capital markets  which in turn can limit  temporarily or for extended periods  our ability to raise capital through equity or debt offerings 
additionally  the availability and cost of obtaining credit commitments from lenders can change as economic conditions and banking regulations reduce the credit that lenders have available or are willing to lend 
these conditions  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector and the re pricing of market risks  can make it difficult to obtain funding for our capital needs from the capital markets on acceptable economic terms 
as a result  we may revise the timing and scope of these projects as necessary to adapt to prevailing market and economic conditions 

table of contents due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding for our capital needs will be available from bank credit arrangements or capital markets on acceptable terms  if needed and to the extent required 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to implement our development plan  enhance our existing business  complete acquisitions and construction projects  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
a downgrade in our credit rating could require us to provide collateral for our hedging liabilities and negatively impact our interest costs and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities 
standard poor s  or s p  dominion bond rating service  or dbrs  and moody s investors service  referred to as moody s  rate our non credit enhanced  senior unsecured debt 
although we are not aware of current plans by the ratings agencies to lower their respective ratings on such debt  we cannot be assured that such credit ratings will not be downgraded 
currently  we are parties to certain international swaps and derivatives association  inc  or isda  agreements associated with the derivative financial instruments we use to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices 
these isda agreements require us to provide assurances of performance if our counterparties exposure to us exceeds certain levels or thresholds 
we generally provide letters of credit to satisfy such requirements 
at december   we have provided million in the form of letters of credit as assurances of performance for our then outstanding derivative financial instruments 
in the event that our credit ratings were to decline to the lowest level of investment grade  as determined by s p and moody s  we would be required to provide letters of credit in substantially greater amounts to satisfy the requirements of our isda agreements 
for example if our credit ratings had been at the lowest level of investment grade at december   we would have been required to provide additional letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million 
the amounts of any letters of credit we would have to establish under the terms of our isda agreements would reduce the amount that we are able to borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility  referred to as our credit facilities 
we may not have sufficient cash flows to enable us to continue to pay distributions at the current level 
we may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to enable us to pay distributions at the current level 
the amount of cash we are able to distribute depends on the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which can fluctuate quarterly based upon a number of factors  including the operating performances of our assets  commodity prices  actions of government regulatory bodies  the level of capital expenditures we make  the amount of cash reserves established by enbridge management  our ability to access capital markets and borrow money  our debt service requirements and restrictions in our credit agreements  fluctuations in our working capital needs  and the cost of acquisitions 

table of contents in addition  the amount of cash we distribute depends primarily on our cash flow rather than net income or net loss 
therefore  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record net losses or may make no distributions during periods when we record net income 
our acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful if we incorrectly predict operating results  are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and integrate acquired assets or businesses 
the acquisition of complementary energy delivery assets is a component of our strategy 
acquisitions present various risks and challenges  including the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of the acquired operations or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring such operations  a decrease in liquidity as a result of utilizing significant amounts of available cash or borrowing capacity to finance an acquisition  the loss of critical customers or employees at the acquired business  the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not fully and adequately indemnified  the risk of failing to effectively integrate the operations or management of acquired assets or businesses or a significant delay in such integration  and diversion of management s attention from existing operations 
in addition  we may be unable to identify acquisition targets and consummate acquisitions in the future 
our financial performance could be adversely affected if our pipeline systems are used less 
our financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes transported on our liquids or natural gas pipeline systems 
decreases in the volumes transported by our systems can directly and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the volume transported on our pipelines can be influenced by factors beyond our control including competition  regulatory action  weather conditions  storage levels  alternative energy sources  decreased demand  fluctuations in energy commodity prices  economic conditions  supply disruptions  
table of contents availability of supply connected to our pipeline systems  and availability and adequacy of infrastructure to move  treat and process supply into and out of our systems 
as an example  the volume of shipments on our lakehead system depends heavily on the supplies of western canadian crude oil 
insufficient supplies of western canadian crude oil will adversely affect our business by limiting shipments on our lakehead system 
decreases in conventional crude oil exploration and production activities in western canada and other factors  including supply disruption  higher development costs and competition  can slow the rate of growth of our lakehead system 
the volume of crude oil that we transport on our lakehead system also depends on the demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the volumes of crude oil and refined products delivered by others into these regions and the province of ontario 
pipeline capacity for the delivery of crude oil to the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states currently exceeds refining capacity 
in addition  our ability to increase deliveries to expand our lakehead system in the future depends on increased supplies of western canadian crude oil 
we expect that growth in future supplies of western canadian crude oil will come from oil sands projects in alberta 
full utilization of additional capacity as a result of our alberta clipper and southern access pipelines and future expansions of our lakehead system  will largely depend on these anticipated increases in crude oil production from oil sands projects 
a reduction in demand for crude oil or a decline in crude oil prices may make certain oil sands projects uneconomical since development costs for production of crude oil from oil sands is greater than development costs for production of conventional crude oil 
oil sands producers may cancel or delay plans to expand their facilities  as some oil sands producers have done in recent years  if crude oil prices are at levels that do not support expansion 
additionally  measures adopted by the government of the province of alberta to increase its share of revenues from oil sands development coupled with a decline in crude oil prices could reduce the volume growth we have anticipated in expanding the capacity of our crude oil pipelines 
the volume of shipments on natural gas and ngl systems depends on the supply of natural gas and ngls available for shipment from the producing regions that supply these systems 
supply available for shipment can be affected by many factors  including commodity prices  weather and drilling activity among other factors listed above 
volumes shipped on these systems are also affected by the demand for natural gas and ngls in the markets these systems serve 
existing customers may not extend their contracts for a variety of reasons  including a decline in the availability of natural gas from our mid continent  united states gulf coast and east texas producing regions  or if the cost of transporting natural gas from other producing regions through other pipelines into the markets served by the natural gas systems were to render the delivered cost of natural gas on our systems uneconomical 
we may be unable to find additional customers to replace the lost demand or transportation fees 
our financial performance may be adversely affected by risks associated with the alberta oil sands 
our lakehead system is highly dependent on sustained production from the alberta oil sands 
growth in production from the oil sands over the past decade has remained strong due to high oil prices and improved production methods  however the industry faces a number of risks associated with the scope and scale of its projects 
factors and risks affecting the oil sands industry include  cost inflation  labor availability  environmental impact  reputation management  
table of contents changing policy and regulation  and commodity price volatility 
alberta oil sands producers face a number of challenges that must be managed effectively to allow for sustained growth in the sector 
the unprecedented level of development in the alberta oil sands has driven costs upward as a result of a tight labor market  high equipment costs  and costs for commodities such as steel and other raw materials 
labor has been one of the most important considerations for the industry  as alberta has the lowest unemployment rate in canada due to the oil and gas industry and as a result  worker wages have risen steadily with industry development over the past several years 
the environmental impact of oil sands development in northern alberta has been at the forefront of discussion around future industry growth in the region 
labor and environmental groups have expressed their views and concerns about oil sands development and pipeline infrastructure in the public domain and in front of regulators 
the primary concerns being heard have been towards greenhouse gas emissions and environmental monitoring and reclamation 
though industry associations have stated that they are not opposed to changes in policy and regulation  the risk of any sort of regulation that may curtail oil sands development or adversely impact the oil and gas industry remains a factor 
volatility in commodity prices is a concern for the oil sands industry 
the relatively high costs and large up front capital investments required by oil sands mega projects makes capital cost recovery a key consideration for future development 
wide commodity price spreads have impacted producer netbacks and margins over the past year and largely result from insufficient pipeline infrastructure and takeaway capacity from producing regions in alberta 
combined with high labor and operating costs this has forced some producers to reconsider or defer projects until a more favorable climate for infrastructure development can be guaranteed 
competition may reduce our revenues 
our lakehead system faces current and potentially further competition for transporting western canadian crude oil from other pipelines  which may reduce our volumes and the associated revenues 
for our cost of service arrangements  these lower volumes will increase our transportation rates 
the increase in transportation rates could result in rates that are higher than competitive conditions will otherwise permit 
our lakehead system competes with other crude oil and refined product pipelines and other methods of delivering crude oil and refined products to the refining centers of minneapolis st 
paul  minnesota  chicago  detroit  michigan  toledo  buffalo  new york  and sarnia and the refinery market and pipeline hub located in the patoka wood river area of southern illinois 
refineries in the markets served by our lakehead system compete with refineries in western canada  the province of ontario and the rocky mountain region of the united states for supplies of western canadian crude oil 
our ozark pipeline system faces competition from a competitor pipeline that carries crude oil from hardisty to wood river and patoka in southern illinois  which came into service in the third quarter of our north dakota system faces increased competition from rail transportation driven by limited transportation infrastructure to key markets 
these transportation and market access constraints have resulted in large crude oil price differences between the north dakota supply basin and refining market centers 
if increased transportation infrastructure is delayed or not built  our north dakota system could continue to experience reduced system utilization 
we also encounter competition in our natural gas gathering  treating  and processing and transmission businesses 
a number of new interstate natural gas transmission pipelines being constructed could reduce the revenue we derive from the intrastate transmission of natural gas 
many of the large wholesale customers served by our natural gas systems have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities 
thus  many of these wholesale customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines or from third 
table of contents parties that may hold capacity on other pipelines 
most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering and processing facilities available to them 
in addition  they have other alternatives  such as building their own gathering facilities or  in some cases  selling their natural gas supplies without processing 
some of our natural gas marketing competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger supplies of natural gas than those available to us  which could allow those competitors to price their services more aggressively than we do 
our gas marketing operations involve market and regulatory risks 
as part of our natural gas marketing activities  we purchase natural gas at prices determined by prevailing market conditions 
following our purchase of natural gas  we generally resell natural gas at a higher price under a sales contract that is generally comparable in terms to our purchase contract  including any price escalation provisions 
the profitability of our natural gas operations may be affected by the following factors our ability to negotiate on a timely basis natural gas purchase and sales agreements in changing markets  reluctance of wholesale customers to enter into long term purchase contracts  consumers willingness to use other fuels when natural gas prices increase significantly  timing of imbalance or volume discrepancy corrections and their impact on financial results  the ability of our customers to make timely payment  inability to match purchase and sale of natural gas on comparable terms  and changes in  limitations upon or elimination of the regulatory authorization required for our wholesale sales of natural gas in interstate commerce 
our results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility and risks associated with our hedging activities 
the prices of natural gas  ngls and crude oil are inherently volatile  and we expect this volatility will continue 
we buy and sell natural gas and ngls in connection with our marketing activities 
our exposure to commodity price volatility is inherent to our natural gas and ngl purchase and resale activities  in addition to our natural gas processing activities 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to reduce our commodity price exposure  we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the level of the hedges 
however  because we are not fully hedged  we will continue to have commodity price exposure on the unhedged portion of the fees we derive from the commodities we receive in kind as payment for our gathering  processing  treating and transportation services 
as a result of this unhedged exposure  a substantial decline in the prices of these commodities could adversely affect our financial performance 
additionally  our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows 
our hedging activities can result in substantial losses if hedging arrangements are imperfect or ineffective and our hedging policies and procedures are not followed properly or do not work as intended 
further  hedging contracts are subject to the credit risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the contracts  particularly during periods of weak and volatile economic conditions 
in addition  certain of the financial instruments we use to hedge our commodity risk exposures must be accounted for on a mark to market basis 
this causes periodic earnings volatility due to fluctuations in commodity prices 

table of contents changes in  or challenges to  our rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the rates charged by several of our pipeline systems are regulated by the ferc or state regulatory agencies or both 
if one of these regulatory agencies  on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties  were to lower our tariff rates  the profitability of our pipeline businesses would suffer 
if we were permitted to raise our tariff rates for a particular pipeline  there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect  which if delayed could further reduce our cash flow 
furthermore  competition from other pipeline systems may prevent us from raising our tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit us to do so 
the regulatory agencies that regulate our systems periodically implement new rules  regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction 
new initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for our services 
we believe that the rates we charge for transportation services on our interstate common carrier oil and open access natural gas pipelines are just and reasonable under the ica and nga  respectively 
however  because the rates that we charge are subject to review upon an appropriately supported protest or complaint  or a regulator s own initiative  we cannot predict what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future for service on our interstate common carrier oil and open access natural gas pipelines 
furthermore  because rates charged for transportation services must be competitive with those charged by other transporters  the rates set forth in our tariffs will be determined based on competitive factors in addition to regulatory considerations 
increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny may reduce our revenues 
our interstate pipelines and certain activities of our intrastate natural gas pipelines are subject to ferc regulation of terms and conditions of service 
in the case of interstate natural gas pipelines  ferc also establishes requirements respecting the construction and abandonment of pipeline facilities 
ferc has pending proposals to increase posting and other compliance requirements applicable to natural gas markets 
such changes could prompt an increase in ferc regulatory oversight of our pipelines and additional legislation that could increase our ferc regulatory compliance costs and decrease the net income generated by our pipeline systems 
compliance with environmental and operational safety regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities 
our pipeline  gathering  processing and trucking operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational and worker safety 
numerous governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with the laws and regulations they administer and permits they issue  oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions 
our failure to comply with these laws  regulations and operating permits can result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations 
our operation of liquid petroleum and natural gas gathering  processing  treating and transportation facilities exposes us to the risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities 
additionally  operational modifications  including pipeline restrictions  necessary to comply with regulatory requirements and resulting from our handling of liquid petroleum and natural gas  historical environmental contamination  accidental releases or upsets  regulatory enforcement  litigation or safety and health incidents can also result in significant cost or limit revenues and volumes 
we may incur joint and several strict liability under these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of liquid petroleum and natural gas and wastes on  under or from our properties and facilities  many of which have been used for gathering or processing activities for a number of years  oftentimes by third parties not under our control 
private parties  including the owners of properties through which our gathering systems pass and facilities where our liquid petroleum and natural gas or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal  may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for 
table of contents personal injury or property damage 
we may also incur costs in the future due to changes in environmental and safety laws and regulations  or re interpretations of enforcement policies or claims for personal  property or environmental damage 
we may not be able to recover these costs from insurance or through higher rates 
our operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 
in june of  the united states house of representatives passed a cap and trade bill known as the american clean energy and security act of  which was then placed on the united states senate legislative calendar for consideration 
however  the senate never acted on the legislation during the th congress  which ended at the end of the u 
s environmental protection agency epa is working on regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions within its existing statutory authority under the clean air act 
in addition  more than one third of the states already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
further  on april   the united states supreme court in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal caa 
in july  the epa released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the caa and other potential methods of regulating greenhouse gases 
on december   the epa finalized its response to the massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa decision by issuing its endangerment finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations  and that certain greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change 
moreover  on september   the epa finalized a rule requiring nation wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions beginning january  the rule applies primarily to large facilities emitting  metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gas  as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and engines 
subsequently  on november   the epa finalized a supplemental rulemaking that expanded the types of industrial sources that are subject to or potentially subject to epa s mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements to include petroleum and natural gas systems 
finally  the may promulgation of regulations to control the greenhouse gas emissions from light duty motor vehicles the tailpipe rule automatically triggered caa provisions that  in general  require stationary source facilities that emit more than  tons per year of greenhouse gas equivalent to obtain permits to demonstrate that best practices and technology are being used to minimize greenhouse gas emissions 
on may   the epa finalized the tailoring rule  which served to increase the greenhouse gas emissions threshold that triggers the permitting requirements for stationary sources 
under a phased in approach  for most purposes  new permitting provisions are required for facilities that emit  tons per year or more of carbon dioxide equivalent 
on june   the circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit upheld the endangerment finding  as well as the tailpipe rule  and ruled that no petitioners had standing to challenge the timing and tailoring rules 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be enforced as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
the united states congress has been considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the development of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs as discussed above 
any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows  in addition to the demand for our services 

table of contents pipeline operations involve numerous risks that may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
operation of complex pipeline systems  gathering  treating  processing and trucking operations involves many risks  hazards and uncertainties 
these events include adverse weather conditions  accidents  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  the performance of the facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions  fires  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  landslides or other similar events beyond our control 
these types of catastrophic events could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution and impairment of our operations  any of which could also result in substantial losses for which insurance may not be sufficient or available and for which we may bear a part or all of the cost 
costs of pipeline seepage over time may be mitigated through insurance  however  if not discovered within the specified insurance time period we would incur full costs for the incident 
in addition  we could be subject to significant fines and penalties from regulators in connection with such events 
for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas  including residential communities  commercial business centers  industrial sites and other public gathering locations  the level of damage resulting from these catastrophic events could be greater 
united states based oil sands development opponents as well as others concerned with environmental impacts of pipeline routes advocated by our competitors have utilized political pressure to influence the timing and whether such permits are granted which could impact future pipeline development 
measurement adjustments on our pipeline system can be materially impacted by changes in estimation  commodity prices and other factors 
oil measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operations associated with our liquid petroleum pipelines 
the three types of oil measurement adjustments that routinely occur on our systems include physical  which results from evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement including sediment and water measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational conditions  degradation resulting from mixing at the interface within our pipeline systems or terminals and storage facilities between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation  which are a function of crude oil prices  the level of our carriers inventory and the inventory positions of customers 
quantifying oil measurement adjustments is inherently difficult because physical measurements of volumes are not practical as products continuously move through our pipelines and virtually all of our pipeline systems are located underground 
in our case  measuring and quantifying oil measurement losses is especially difficult because of the length of our pipeline systems and the number of different grades of crude oil and types of crude oil products we transport 
accordingly  we utilize engineering based models and operational assumptions to estimate product volumes in our system and associated oil measurement losses 
natural gas measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines 
the quantification and resolution of measurement adjustments is complicated by several factors including the significant quantities ie  thousands of measurement meters that we use throughout our natural gas systems  primarily around our gathering and processing assets  varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems  and variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies 
each of these factors may contribute to measurement adjustments that can occur on our natural gas systems 

table of contents we are exposed to credit risks of our customers  and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations 
some of our customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness 
severe financial problems encountered by our customers could limit our ability to collect amounts owed to us  or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements 
in addition  many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity 
the combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices  a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve based credit facility and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of our customers liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to us 
furthermore  some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks  which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us 
financial problems experienced by our customers could result in the impairment of our assets  reduction of our operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services  which could reduce our revenues 
risks arising from our partnership structure and relationships with our general partner and enbridge management the interests of enbridge may differ from our interests and the interests of our security holders  and the board of directors of enbridge management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict  not just the interests of our security holders  in making important business decisions 
enbridge indirectly owns all of the shares of our general partner and all of the voting shares of enbridge management  and elects all of the directors of both companies 
furthermore  some of the directors and officers of our general partner and enbridge management are also directors and officers of enbridge 
consequently  conflicts of interest could arise between our unitholders and enbridge 
our partnership agreement limits the fiduciary duties of our general partner to our unitholders 
these restrictions allow our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest by considering the interests of all of the parties to the conflict  including enbridge management s interests  our interests and those of our general partner 
in addition  these limitations reduce the rights of our unitholders under our partnership agreement to sue our general partner or enbridge management  its delegate  should its directors or officers act in a way that  were it not for these limitations of liability  would constitute breaches of their fiduciary duties 
we do not have any employees 
in managing our business and affairs  we rely on employees of enbridge  and its affiliates  who act on behalf of and as agents for us 
a decrease in the availability of employees from enbridge could adversely affect us 
our partnership agreement and the delegation of control agreement limit the fiduciary duties that enbridge management and our general partner owe to our unitholders and restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by enbridge management and our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty 
our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that our general partner would otherwise owe to our unitholders under state fiduciary duty law 
through the delegation of control agreement  these modified fiduciary duties also apply to enbridge management as the delegate of our general partner 
for example  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions  including the determination of which factors it will consider in resolving conflicts of interest  in its sole discretion 
this entitles our general 
table of contents partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires  and it has no duty or obligation to give consideration to any interest of  or factors affecting  us  our affiliates or any unitholder  provides that any standard of care and duty imposed on our general partner will be modified  waived or limited as required to permit our general partner to act under our partnership agreement and to make any decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in our partnership agreement  so long as such action is reasonably believed by the general partner to be in our best interests  and provides that our general partner and its directors and officers will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our unitholders for any acts or omissions if they acted in good faith 
these and similar provisions in our partnership agreement may restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by enbridge management or our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty 
potential conflicts of interest may arise among enbridge and its shareholders  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
because the fiduciary duties of the directors of our general partner and enbridge management have been modified  the directors may be permitted to make decisions that benefit enbridge and its shareholders or enbridge management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders 
conflicts of interest may arise from time to time among enbridge and its shareholders  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
conflicts of interest may also arise from time to time between us and our unitholders  on the one hand  and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
in managing and controlling us as the delegate of our general partner  enbridge management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict and may resolve those conflicts by making decisions that benefit enbridge and its shareholders or enbridge management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders 
the following decisions  among others  could involve conflicts of interest whether we or enbridge will pursue certain acquisitions or other business opportunities  whether we will issue additional units or other equity securities or whether we will purchase outstanding units  whether enbridge management or enbridge partners will issue additional shares or other equity securities  the amount of payments to enbridge and its affiliates for any services rendered for our benefit  the amount of costs that are reimbursable to enbridge management or enbridge and its affiliates by us  the enforcement of obligations owed to us by enbridge management  our general partner or enbridge  including obligations regarding competition between enbridge and us  and the retention of separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for us and enbridge management 
in these and similar situations  any decision by enbridge management may benefit one group more than another  and in making such decisions  enbridge management may consider the interests of all groups  as well as other factors  in deciding whether to take a particular course of action 

table of contents in other situations  enbridge may take certain actions  including engaging in businesses that compete with us  that are adverse to us and our unitholders 
for example  although enbridge and its subsidiaries are generally restricted from engaging in any business that is in direct material competition with our businesses  that restriction is subject to the following significant exceptions enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from continuing to engage in businesses  including the normal development of such businesses  in which they were engaged at the time of our initial public offering in december  such restriction is limited geographically only to those routes and products for which we provided transportation at the time of our initial public offering  enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us as part of a larger acquisition  so long as the majority of the value of the business or assets acquired  in enbridge s reasonable judgment  is not attributable to the competitive business  and enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us if that business is first offered for acquisition to us and the board of directors of enbridge management and our unitholders determine not to pursue the acquisition 
since we were not engaged in any aspect of the natural gas business at the time of our initial public offering  enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from competing with us in any aspect of the natural gas business 
in addition  enbridge and its subsidiaries would be permitted to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum over routes that are not the same as our lakehead system  even if such transportation is in direct material competition with our business 
these exceptions also expressly permitted the reversal by enbridge in of one of its pipelines that extends from sarnia to montreal  quebec 
as a result of this reversal  enbridge competes with us to supply crude oil to the ontario market 
we can issue additional common or other classes of units  including additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares  which would dilute your ownership interest 
the issuance of additional common or other classes of units by us  including the issuance of additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares may have the following effects the amount available for distributions on each unit may decrease  the relative voting power of each previously outstanding unit may decrease  and the market price of the class a common units may decline 
additionally  the public sale by our general partner of a significant portion of the class a or class b common units that it currently owns could reduce the market price of the class a common units 
our partnership agreement allows the general partner to cause us to register for public sale any units held by the general partner or its affiliates 
a public or private sale of the class a or class b common units currently held by our general partner could absorb some of the trading market demand for the outstanding class a common units 
holders of our limited partner interests have limited voting rights 
our unitholders have limited voting rights on matters affecting our business  which may have a negative effect on the price at which our common units trade 
in particular  the unitholders did not elect our general partner or the directors of our general partner or enbridge management and have no rights to elect our general 
table of contents partner or the directors of our general partner or enbridge management on an annual or other continuing basis 
furthermore  if unitholders are not satisfied with the performance of our general partner  they may find it difficult to remove our general partner 
under the provisions of our partnership agreement  our general partner may be removed upon the vote of at least of the outstanding common units excluding the units held by the general partner and its affiliates and a majority of the outstanding i units voting together as a separate class excluding the number of i units corresponding to the number of shares of enbridge management held by our general partner and its affiliates 
such removal must  however  provide for the election and succession of a new general partner  who may be required to purchase the departing general partner interest in us in order to become the successor general partner 
such restrictions may limit the flexibility of the limited partners in removing our general partner  and removal may also result in the general partner interest in us held by the departing general partner being converted into class a common units 
we are a holding company and depend entirely on our operating subsidiaries distributions to service our debt obligations 
we are a holding company with no material operations 
if we cannot receive cash distributions from our operating subsidiaries  we will not be able to meet our debt service obligations 
our operating subsidiaries may from time to time incur additional indebtedness under agreements that contain restrictions  which could further limit each operating subsidiaries ability to make distributions to us 
the debt securities we issue and any guarantees issued by any of our subsidiaries that are guarantors will be structurally subordinated to the claims of the creditors of any of our operating subsidiaries who are not guarantors of the debt securities 
holders of the debt securities will not be creditors of our operating subsidiaries who have not guaranteed the debt securities 
the claims to the assets of these non guarantor operating subsidiaries derive from our own ownership interest in those operating subsidiaries 
claims of our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors will generally have priority as to the assets of such operating subsidiaries over our own ownership interest claims and will therefore have priority over the holders of our debt  including the debt securities 
our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors may include general creditors  trade creditors  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and creditors holding guarantees 
enbridge management s discretion in establishing our cash reserves gives it the ability to reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
enbridge management may establish cash reserves for us that in its reasonable discretion are necessary to fund our future operating and capital expenditures  provide for the proper conduct of business  and comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners 
these cash reserves affect the amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our common units 

table of contents risks arising from our partnership structure total insurance coverage for multiple insurable incidents exceeding coverage limits would be allocated by our general partner on an equitable basis 
we are included in the comprehensive insurance program that is maintained by enbridge for its subsidiaries and affiliates through the policy renewal date of may  the comprehensive insurance program also includes property insurance coverage on our assets  except pipeline assets that are not located at water crossings  including earnings interruption resulting from an insurable event 
in the unlikely event multiple insurable incidents occur which exceed coverage limits within the same insurance period  the total insurance coverage will be allocated among the enbridge entities on an equitable basis based on an insurance allocation agreement the partnership has entered into with enbridge and another enbridge subsidiary 
risks related to our debt and our ability to make distributions agreements relating to our debt restrict our ability to make distributions  which could adversely affect the value of our class a common units  and our ability to incur additional debt and otherwise maintain financial and operating flexibility 
we are prohibited from making distributions to our unitholders during the existence of certain defaults under our credit facilities or during a period in which we have elected to defer interest payments on the junior notes  subject to limited exceptions as set forth in the related indenture 
further  the agreements governing our credit facilities may prevent us from engaging in transactions or capitalizing on business opportunities that we believe could be beneficial to us by requiring us to comply with various covenants  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on incurring additional debt  entering into mergers or consolidations or sales of assets  and granting liens 
although the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional debt  they impose restrictions on our ability to enter into mergers or consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  to incur liens to secure debt and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
a breach of any restriction under our credit facilities or our indentures could permit the holders of the related debt to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements immediately due and payable and  in the case of our credit facilities  terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
any subsequent refinancing of our current debt or any new indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have similar or greater restrictions 
tax risks to common unitholders the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if we were to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to additional amounts of entity level taxation for state tax purposes  then our cash available for distribution to unitholders could be substantially reduced 
as long as we qualify to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  we are not subject to federal income tax 
although a publicly traded limited partnership is generally treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  a publicly traded partnership such as us can qualify to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes under current law so long as for each taxable year at least of our gross income is derived from specified investments and activities 
we believe that we qualify to be treated as a partnership for 
table of contents federal income tax purposes because we believe that at least of our gross income for each taxable year has been and is derived from such specified investments and activities 
although we intend to meet this gross income requirement  we may not find it possible  regardless of our efforts  to meet this gross income requirement or may inadvertently fail to meet this gross income requirement 
if we do not meet this gross income requirement for any taxable year and the internal revenue service  or irs  does not determine that such failure was inadvertent  we would be treated as a corporation for such taxable year and each taxable year thereafter 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or certain other matters affecting us 
additionally  current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes without regard to our sources of income or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
legislation has been proposed that would eliminate partnership tax treatment for certain publicly traded partnerships 
although such legislation would not apply to us as currently proposed  it could be amended prior to enactment in a manner that does apply to us 
we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted 
moreover  any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may be applied retroactively 
if we were to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of 
under current law  distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed as corporate distributions  and no income  gain  loss or deduction would flow through to our unitholders 
if we were treated as a corporation at the state level  we may also be subject to the income tax provisions of certain states 
moreover  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
for example  we are required to pay texas franchise tax at a minimum effective rate of of our gross income apportioned to texas in the prior year 
if we become subject to federal income tax and additional state taxes  the additional taxes we pay will reduce the amount of cash we can distribute each quarter to the holders of our class a and b common units and the number of i units that we will distribute quarterly 
therefore  our treatment as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or becoming subject to a material amount of additional state taxes could result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to our unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our units 
moreover  our payment of additional federal and state taxes could materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
if the irs contests our curative tax allocations or other federal income tax positions we take  the market for our class a common units may be impacted and the cost of any irs contest will reduce our cash available for distribution or payments on our debt securities 
our partnership agreement allows curative allocations of income  deduction  gain and loss by us to account for differences between the tax basis and fair market value of property at the time the property is contributed or deemed contributed to us and to account for differences between the fair market value and book basis of our assets existing at the time of issuance of any class a common units 
if the irs does not respect our curative allocations  ratios of taxable income to cash distributions received by the holders of class a common units will be materially higher than previously estimated 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions we have taken or may take on certain tax matters 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we have taken or may take 
a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we have taken or may take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our class a common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution or payments on our debt securities 

table of contents the tax liability of our unitholders could exceed their distributions or proceeds from sales of class a common units 
because our unitholders will generally be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute  our unitholders will be required to pay any federal income tax and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their allocable share of our income  even if they do not receive cash distributions from us 
unitholders will not necessarily receive cash distributions equal to the tax on their allocable share of our taxable income 
tax gain or loss on the disposition of our class a common units could be more or less than expected 
if a unitholder disposes of class a common units  the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the unitholder s tax basis in those class a common units 
because distributions in excess of a unitholder s allocable share of our net taxable income decrease the unitholder s tax basis in their class a common units  the amount  if any  of such prior excess distributions with respect to their class a common units sold will  in effect  become taxable income to the unitholder if the class a common units are sold at a price greater than the unitholder s tax basis in those class a common units  even if the price the unitholder receives is less than the unitholder s original cost 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized includes a unitholder s share of our nonrecourse liabilities  if a unitholder sells class a common units  the unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale 
as a result of investing in our class a common units  a unitholder may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in the states where we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business 
in addition to federal income taxes  a unitholder will likely be subject to other taxes  including state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we or our subsidiaries conduct business or own property now or in the future  even if such unitholder does not live in any of those jurisdictions 
our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions 
further  our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business in the states of alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kansas  kentucky  louisiana  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  missouri  montana  new york  pennsylvania  south carolina  north carolina  north dakota  oklahoma  tennessee  texas and wisconsin 
most of these states impose an income tax on individuals  corporations and other entities 
as we make acquisitions or expand our business  we may acquire property or conduct business in additional states or in foreign jurisdictions that impose a personal income tax 
it is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all required united states federal  foreign  state and local tax returns 
ownership of class a common units raises issues for tax exempt entities and other investors 
an investment in our class a common units by tax exempt entities  such as employee benefit plans  individual retirement accounts  known as iras  keogh plans and other retirement plans  regulated investment companies and foreign persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from united states federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non united states persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable tax rate  and non united states persons will be required to file united states federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
tax exempt entities and non united states persons should consult their tax adviser before investing in our class a common units 

table of contents we adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and our unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the class a common units 
when we issue additional class a common units or engage in certain other transactions  we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and our general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  under our valuation methods  subsequent purchasers of class a common units may have a greater portion of their internal revenue code section b adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our valuation methods  or our allocation of the section b adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets  and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of class a common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the class a common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in our termination as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have been terminated for united states federal tax purposes if there are sales or exchanges which  in the aggregate  constitute or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve month period 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders  which would result in us filing two tax returns and our unitholders could receive two schedules k for one fiscal year and could result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions available in computing our taxable income 
in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in such unitholder s taxable income for the year of termination 
our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  but instead  we would be treated as a new partnership for federal tax purposes 
if treated as a new partnership for federal tax purposes  we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred 
we treat each purchaser of class a common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual class a common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could result in a unitholder owing more tax and may adversely affect the value of the class a common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of our class a common units and to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our class a common units  we have adopted certain depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
these positions may result in an understatement of deductions and losses and an overstatement of income and gain to our unitholders 
for example  we do not amortize certain goodwill assets  the value of which has been attributed to certain of our outstanding class a common units 
a subsequent holder of those class a common units is entitled to an amortization deduction attributable to that goodwill under internal revenue code section b 
however  because we cannot identify these class a common units once they are traded by the initial holder  we do not give any subsequent holder of a class a common unit any such amortization deduction 
this approach understates deductions available to those unitholders who own those class a common units and results in a reduction in the tax basis of those class a common units by the amount of the deductions that were allowable but were not taken 

table of contents the irs may challenge the manner in which we calculate our unitholder s basis adjustment under internal revenue code section b 
if so  because neither we nor a unitholder can identify the class a common units to which this issue relates once the initial holder has traded them  the irs may assert adjustments to all unitholders selling class a common units within the period under audit as if all unitholders owned class a common units with respect to which allowable deductions were not taken 
any position we take that is inconsistent with applicable treasury regulations may have to be disclosed on our federal income tax return 
this disclosure increases the likelihood that the irs will challenge our positions and propose adjustments to some or all of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to this position or other positions we may take could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from a unitholder s sale of class a common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the class a common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns 
a unitholder whose class a common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of class a common units may be considered as having disposed of those class a common units 
if so  such unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those class a common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a unitholder whose class a common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of class a common units may be considered as having disposed of those class a common units  such unitholder may no longer be treated as a partner with respect to those class a common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those class a common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those class a common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their class a common units
