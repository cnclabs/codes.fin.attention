acquisitions 
in november  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of berkeley transportation systems  inc bts  a privately held company based in berkeley  california which specializes in transportation performance measurement  for an initial cash payment of approximately  in the quarter ended december   the company entered into an amendment to the bts stock purchase agreement which modified certain earn out provisions and as a result  the company paid  in cash to the bts shareholders for achievement of those modified earn out provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal the amendment did not have a material impact on previous estimated amounts accrued in connection with the earn out provisions 
this payment completed the company s obligation under the earn out provisions of the agreement 
additionally  we are scheduled to pay to the bts shareholders up to a total of approximately  by november pursuant to certain holdback and deferred payment provisions 
in january  we acquired all of the capital stock of meridian environmental technology  inc met for an initial cash payment of approximately million 
met specializes in advanced traveler information systems and offers maintenance decision support system mdss management tools that allow users to create solutions to meet roadway maintenance decision needs 
we also agreed to pay up to million on each of the first two anniversaries of the closing of the acquisition upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  as well as up to an additional million under a month earn out provision 
in january  we made a cash payment of approximately  of the first deferred payment to the shareholders of met and held back  in accordance with certain provisions of the purchase agreement 
in june  we determined the contingencies related to the release of the  holdback were not met 
as a result  no portion of the  holdback was released and the entire amount was reversed into operating income during the second quarter of fiscal additionally  no amounts were earned by the met shareholders related to the first and second year earn out provisions  which ended on december  and  respectively 
the second deferred payment of million was due in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of certain holdback provisions and other deductions  we currently expect to pay approximately  to the met shareholders in the first quarter of the fiscal  which is recorded in our accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at march  
table of contents refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report  for additional discussion on these acquisitions 
sale of vehicle sensors 
on july   we completed the sale of substantially all of our assets used in connection with our vehicle sensors segment to bendix pursuant to an asset purchase agreement signed on july  the asset sale 
upon closing  bendix paid us million in cash  subject to a million holdback and adjustments based upon the working capital of the vehicle sensors segment at closing  and bendix assumed certain specified obligations and liabilities of the vehicle sensors segment 
in october  we received approximately million in connection with the holdback provision 
furthermore  we are entitled to additional consideration in the form of certain performance and royalty related earn outs 
as of march   we received approximately million in connection with royalty related earn outs provisions for a total of million in cash from the asset sale as a result of the asset sale  we no longer operate in the vehicle sensors segment and we determined that the vehicle sensors segment  which previously constituted one of our operating segments  qualifies as a discontinued operation 
the applicable financial results of the vehicle sensors segment through the closing of the asset sale have been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report  for additional discussion on this transaction 
business segments 
subsequent to the asset sale and our acquisition of bts  we now operate in three reportable segments roadway sensors  transportation systems and iperform 
roadway sensors the roadway sensors segment includes  among other products  our vantage  versicam  pico  vantage vector  smartcycle  smartscan and abacus vehicle detection systems for traffic intersection control  incident detection and certain highway traffic data collection applications 
transportation systems the transportation systems segment includes transportation engineering and consulting services  and the development of transportation management and traveler information systems for the its industry 
this segment also includes advanced traveler information systems and offers weather related maintenance decision support system management tools that allow users to create solutions to meet roadway maintenance decision needs 
iperform the iperform segment includes our transportation performance measurement and information management solutions 
the iperform performance measurement solutions leverage its real time data collection  diagnostic  fusion and warehousing platform to aggregate and compute performance measurements 
beginning in april  we internally recognized certain groups within our transportation systems and iperform segments to better align our resources and deliverables with the activities of those segments 
as a result  all of the revenues and expenses of the predictive weather and maintenance decision support system operations include in transportation systems will be reassigned to ipeform 
business 
given the current ongoing uncertainties regarding global economic conditions  we continue to remain cautious about our overall business 
we believe the overall ongoing unfavorable economic environment has negatively affected  and may continue to negatively affect  our financial results for the foreseeable future  and may impair our ability to accurately forecast our future financial performance and other business trends 
in addition  since the end users of a majority of our products and services are governmental entities  we have been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by the budgetary issues and delays in purchasing decisions that many municipalities and other state and local agencies continue to face 
spending for new roadways  new systems to address traffic congestion and other transportation infrastructure improvements has been delayed or eliminated in some instances 
however  we believe the need to rebuild and modernize aging transportation infrastructure will continue  and in addition to funds available through the federal highway bill  there exist various other funding mechanisms that support transportation infrastructure and related projects 
these include bonds  dedicated sales and gas tax measures and other alternative funding sources 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
table of contents united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to the collectability of accounts receivable  the valuation of inventories  the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  the realizability of deferred tax assets  accounting for stock based compensation  the valuation of equity instruments  the valuation of contingent acquisition consideration  warranty reserves and other contingencies 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
product revenues and related costs of sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery under the terms of the arrangement has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are typically met at the time of product shipment  but in certain circumstances  may not be met until receipt or acceptance by the customer 
accordingly  at the date revenue is recognized  the significant obligations or uncertainties concerning the sale have been resolved 
we recognize revenue from the sale of deliverables that are part of a multiple element arrangement in accordance with applicable accounting guidance that establishes a relative selling price hierarchy permitting the use of an estimated selling price to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement where neither vendor specific objective evidence vsoe nor third party evidence tpe of fair value is available for that deliverable 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  we are required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration is allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items that has stand alone value based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on our estimated selling prices 
we account for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software and software related services in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for software and software related transactions 
for such transactions  revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element  and fair value is determined by vsoe 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements and the only undelivered element is post contract customer support or maintenance  and vsoe of the fair value of such support or maintenance does not exist  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established but vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  we use the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
transportation systems revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts with governmental agencies 
when appropriate  revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  whereby revenue is recognized as contract performance progresses and is determined based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
profit incentives are included in revenues when their realization is reasonably assured 
certain of our revenues are recognized as services are performed and amounts are earned  which is measured by time incurred or other contractual milestones or output measures 
revenues accounted for in this manner generally relate to certain cost plus fixed fee or time and materials contracts 
accounts receivable 
the collectability of our accounts receivable is evaluated through review of outstanding invoices and ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables deemed to be at risk for collection as well as a general allowance based on our historical collections experience 
considerable judgment is required in assessing and estimating the ultimate realization of trade receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents inventories 
inventories consist of finished goods  work in process and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventories to net realizable value for estimated excess and obsolete inventories in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventories and their estimated realizable value 
these estimates are based on management s judgments and assumptions as to future demand requirements and our evaluation of market conditions 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimated inventory write downs  once established  are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped  so if actual market conditions are more favorable in the fiscal periods subsequent to those in which we record significant write downs  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets 
other long lived assets primarily represent purchased intangible assets including developed technology  customer relationships  trade names and patents 
we currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from one to seven years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used or  if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  using a straight line amortization method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
we have determined that our reporting units for purposes of testing for goodwill impairment are identical to our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes 
in fiscal  we early adopted the provisions issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb that were intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
this guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we conduct a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values 
we determine the fair values of our reporting units using the income valuation approach  as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  is recognized as an impairment loss 
we monitor the indicators for goodwill impairment testing between annual tests 
certain adverse business conditions impacting one or more reporting units would cause us to test goodwill for impairment on an interim basis 
as part of our annual assessment  management determines the most appropriate and efficient method to assess goodwill for impairment  which could include either the simplified testing approach or the two step goodwill test described above 
we test long lived assets and purchased intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
we determine whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is recoverable  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows the asset are expected to generate 
if an asset is not recoverable  we record an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we primarily use the income valuation approach to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and purchased intangible assets 
warranty 
we generally provide a one to three year warranty from the original invoice date on our products  materials and workmanship 
products sold to various original equipment manufacturer customers sometimes carry longer warranties 
defective products will be either repaired or replaced  usually at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
the accrued warranty reserve is included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
should our actual experience of warranty returns be higher than anticipated  additional warranty reserves may be required  which would adversely affect our product gross profit and our operating results 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  which increases our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our anticipated annual effective tax rate will be  while also separately considering applicable discrete and other non recurring items  and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with this anticipated rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we refine our estimates based upon actual events and financial results during the year 
this estimation process can result in significant changes to our expected effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust our income tax provision during the quarter in which our estimates are refined so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual effective tax rate 
these changes  along with adjustments to our deferred taxes  among others  may create fluctuations in our overall effective tax rate from quarter to quarter 

table of contents income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation in the statements of operations as an expense  based on the estimated grant date fair value of our stock based awards  whereby such fair values are amortized over the requisite service period 
our stock based awards are currently comprised of common stock options and restricted stock units 
the fair value of our stock option awards is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing formula 
while utilizing this model meets established requirements  the estimated fair values generated by it may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock option awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense

table of contents analysis of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal results of operations total revenues 
total revenues are comprised of sales from our roadway sensors  transportation systems and iperform segments 
the following tables present details of total revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal year ended march  increase change in thousands  except percentages total revenues year ended march  increase change in thousands  except percentages total revenues we currently have  and historically have had  a diverse customer base 
for fiscal  one individual customer represented approximately of our total revenues and no other individual customer represented greater than of our total revenues 
for fiscal and fiscal  no individual customer represented greater than of our total revenues 
total revenues for fiscal increased approximately to million  compared to million in fiscal  due primarily to an increase of approximately in transportation systems revenues and an increase in iperform revenues of approximately million  which was attributable to a full twelve months of revenues in fiscal from the acquisition of bts in november these increases in revenue were partially offset by an approximate decrease in roadway sensors revenues 
total revenues for fiscal increased approximately to million  compared to million in fiscal  due primarily to an increase of approximately in transportation systems revenues  partially offset by a decrease of approximately in roadway sensors revenues 
approximately million of the increase in total revenues was attributable to a full year of met revenues  while  of the increase was attributable to the acquisition of bts in november roadway sensors revenues in fiscal decreased approximately compared to fiscal  due mainly as a result of a decrease in federal stimulus funded projects and as a result of the discontinuation of redevelopment agencies in california 
the federal stimulus funded projects and redevelopment agencies in california had a positive impact on roadway sensors revenues in the prior year periods 
roadway sensors revenues in fiscal were marginally lower compared to fiscal due primarily to certain international customer orders in fiscal which did not recur in fiscal going forward  we plan to focus on our core domestic intersection market and refine and deliver products that address the needs of this market  namely our vantage processor and camera systems and our vantage vector video radar hybrid sensor  as well as our smartcycle and smartscan products  which were introduced in fiscal we also plan to focus on international distribution channel expansion and expect to continue to refine products that address these markets  namely our abacus  pico and versicam products 
revenues from our transportation systems segment are primarily dependent upon the continued availability of funding at the local  state and federal levels from the various agencies and departments of transportation 
transportation systems revenues for fiscal increased approximately compared to fiscal due in part to several significant project wins in the first two quarters of fiscal transportation systems revenues for fiscal increased approximately compared to fiscal  primarily due to several significant project wins in the last two quarters of fiscal  as well as a full year of met revenues  which increased by million from fiscal going forward  we plan to continue to pursue larger contracts that may contain significant sub consulting content  which will likely contribute to variability in the timing and amount of our transportation systems revenues from period to period 
we also intend to continue to expand our foreign operations by pursuing additional international opportunities in the middle east and other regions 
among other factors  we believe the ability of our transportation systems segment to grow and successfully win and service new contracts will be highly dependent upon our continued success in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  as well as upon government funding initiatives in the markets we serve 
approximately million of the total revenues in fiscal and approximately  of the total revenues in fiscal were attributable to the iperform segment and was a direct result of the bts acquisition in november going forward  we 
table of contents plan to continue investing in this segment  particularly in research  development  sales and marketing of the iterispems performance measurement solutions with a near term focus on delivering iterispems to public agencies 
we also plan for iperform to pursue commercial opportunities in the media and automotive sectors  offering both data services and analytics 
the recently enacted federal highway bill could provide government agencies with funding for its technologies in transportation infrastructure  traffic management and performance measurement projects 
gross profit 
the following tables present details of our gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal year ended march  increase change in thousands  except percentages gross profit gross profit as a of total revenues year ended march  increase change in thousands  except percentages gross profit gross profit as a of total revenues our total gross profit as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal decreased approximately compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our product and service mix 
revenues derived from our roadway sensors segment decreased to approximately of our total revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal roadway sensors revenues generally carry higher margins than transportation systems and iperform revenues  therefore  a shift in the sales mix weighted less towards roadway sensors revenues can negatively impact our overall margin 
gross profits as a percentage of total revenues also declined  to a lesser extent  as a result of an approximate decrease in roadway sensors profit margins due to the overall decrease in revenues and an increase in sustaining engineering activities 
our total gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our product and service mix  whereby transportation systems revenues significantly increased as percentage of total revenues 
roadway sensors revenues represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage was also attributable the roadway sensors customer mix between dealer sales and direct sales  whereby we generally enjoy higher gross margins on direct product sales as compared to sales through our dealer channels 
the decrease was also due in part to certain manufacturing overhead costs previously absorbed by the vehicle sensors segment that was divested in fiscal roadway sensors gross profit can fluctuate in any specific quarter or year based on  among other factors  customer and product mix  competitive pricing requirements  product warranty costs and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  as well as shifts of engineering resources from development activities to sustaining activities  which we record as cost of goods sold 
we recognize a portion of our transportation systems revenues and related gross profit using percentage of completion contract accounting and the underlying mix of contract activity affects the related gross profit recognized in any given period 
for the transportation systems segment  we expect to experience gross profit variability in future periods due to our contract mix and related sub consulting content  as well as factors such as paid holidays and our ability to efficiently utilize our workforce  which could or may cause fluctuations in our margins from period to period 
if sub consultant content further expands as a percentage of our overall transportation system revenues  we may experience a flat or declining gross profit percentage in this segment

the following table presents selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal and year ended march  of of increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  insurance and supplies travel and conferences professional and outside services other selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to i higher salary  travel and headcount related expenses as we added certain key sales and marketing personnel  ii added personnel as well as facilities and other related operating costs as a result of the met and bts acquisitions  iii certain legal and professional services related to the sale of our vehicle sensors segment that were not offset against the gain on the asset sale and iv certain other corporate initiatives related to the development of our performance measurement software 
research and development expense the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal year ended march  of of increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  development and supplies other research and development research and development expense in fiscal decreased approximately when compared to fiscal  primarily due to certain expenditures related to software development in the ipeform segment that in the current year periods have been capitalized to the balance sheet as well as certain reductions to roadway sensors salary and personnel related expenditures 
these reductions were offset by an increase in facility rents  development and supplies expense 
the increase in facility costs was 
table of contents attributable to a full twelve month period for our berkeley  california office  related to the operations of bts that were acquired in november the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal year ended march  of of amount revenues amount revenues increase change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  development and supplies other research and development research and development expenses for fiscal were higher than fiscal primarily due to i the allocation of additional resources to various development projects in our roadway sensors segment  including our vantage vector vehicle detection sensor  ii development costs related to our iterispems information management solution  and iii additional headcount and other expenses in fiscal related to the met and bts acquisitions 
impairment of goodwill in fiscal  we adopted the provisions issued by the fasb that are intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
the updated guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we conduct a two step goodwill impairment test 
we performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill for fiscal and fiscal in their fourth fiscal quarters  respectively 
we determined it was more appropriate and cost effective to perform a qualitative assessment in fiscal and a quantitative first step assessment in fiscal to estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach 
based on our assessments  we determined that no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 
during fiscal  due primarily to lower than expected operating results in our transportation systems reporting unit  as well as ongoing weakness specifically in the transportation systems markets  we determined it was necessary to perform an interim test of impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in our transportation systems reporting unit as of december  in performing the first step in this analysis  we estimated the fair value of our transportation systems reporting unit using the income approach 
as of december   we determined that the carrying value of our transportation systems reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and  accordingly  we performed the second step of the impairment analysis to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill of this reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
to determine this value  we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities  including certain intangible assets  to be allocated to the transportation systems reporting unit as of december  the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value amounts of its assets and liabilities 
the impairment loss for the transportation systems reporting unit was measured by the amount the carrying value of its goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
accordingly  in order to write down transportation systems goodwill with a carrying value of million to its implied fair value of million  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the three months ended december   the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the impairment charge taken in fiscal and based on our goodwill impairment testing for fiscal and fiscal  we believe the carrying value of our goodwill is not currently at risk of impairment  as the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values at march  if our actual financial results  or the plans and estimates used in future goodwill impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess impairment of our goodwill  we could incur future goodwill impairment charges 
interest expense  net net interest expense was approximately   and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the sequential decreases were primarily due to a continuous decrease in the overall level of borrowings on our term note 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  all principal and interest payments under the term note were paid in full 
see liquidity and capital resources below for additional details on our borrowings 
income taxes the following table presents our provision for income taxes for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal year ended march  in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal was unfavorably impacted by permanent non deductible tax items  including share based payments and other permanent differences amounting to approximately  and by the recording a valuation allowance against certain of our state net operating losses in the amount of  net of federal benefit 
these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the recognition of tax credits of approximately  for research and development and hiring activities  and by approximately  of tax benefit from non taxable favorable fair value adjustments recognized for financial statement purposes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the recognition of approximately  of previously unrecognized tax benefits during the year due to the expiration of statutes limitation in various jurisdictions  by the recognition of tax credits of approximately  for research and development activities  and by approximately  of tax benefit from non taxable favorable fair value adjustments recognized for financial statement purposes 
these favorable impacts were partially offset by the impact of recognizing approximately  of expense upon the expiration of a state net operating loss  net of federal benefit 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted unfavorably by a portion of the charge recorded for the impairment of goodwill  amounting to approximately million  for which there is no corresponding tax basis 
this unfavorable impact was partially offset by the impact of the recognition of approximately  of previously unrecognized tax benefits during the year due to expiration of certain federal and state statutes in various jurisdictions 
as of march   we recorded a valuation allowance against certain of our state net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of  net of federal tax benefit  which we estimated were more likely to not be realized within the applicable carryforward period 
as of march   we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized and no general valuation allowance was recorded against our deferred tax assets at that time 
as we update our estimates in future periods  adjustments to our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance may be necessary 
we anticipate this will cause our future overall effective tax rate in any given period to fluctuate from prior effective tax rates and statutory tax rates 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including  but not limited to  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
at march   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in and  respectively 
although the impact cannot be precisely determined at this time  we believe that our net operating loss carryforwards will cause us to have future income tax payments that are substantially lower than the income tax liability calculated using statutory tax rates 
due to changes in stock ownership  our federal net operating loss carryforwards and other federal attributes are subject to a section annual limitation 
as of march   based on the cumulative amount of tax attributes that have become available under the limitation imposed by section  all of our net operating losses are currently fully available for use 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have historically financed our operations with a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and the sale of equity securities 
we currently rely on cash flows from operations  or cash position and the availability of borrowings on a line of credit facility to fund our operations  which we believe to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need or choose to raise additional capital to fund potential future acquisitions and our future growth 
we may raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors or by borrowing money from 
table of contents financial institutions 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution and any equity securities that may be issued may have rights senior to our existing stockholders 
at march   we had million in working capital  which included no borrowings on our million line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
this compares to working capital of million at march   which included no borrowings on our line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
the following table summarizes our cash flows for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal year ended march  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities

borrowings in october  we entered into a million credit facility with california bank trust cb t 
this credit facility provided for a two year revolving line of credit with borrowings of up to million and a million month term note 
in september  we entered into a modification agreement with cb t to extend the expiration date of our revolving line of credit to october  in september  we entered into a second modification agreement with cb t to extend the expiration date of our revolving line of credit to october  interest on borrowed amounts under the revolving line of credit are payable monthly at a rate equal to the current stated prime rate at march  up to the current stated prime rate plus  depending on aggregate deposit balances maintained at the bank in relation to the total loan commitment under the credit facility 
we are obligated to pay an unused line fee of per annum applied to the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit during the preceding month 
the revolving line of credit does not contain early termination fees and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of march  and march   no amounts were borrowed under the revolving line of credit portion of the credit facility

while we believe we are currently in compliance with all such financial covenants  we cannot assure you that we will not violate one or more covenants in the future

in this event  we cannot assure you that we would be able to quickly obtain equivalent or suitable replacement financing on acceptable terms  on a timely basis  or at all 
if we were not able to secure alternative sources of financing  such acceleration would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition
