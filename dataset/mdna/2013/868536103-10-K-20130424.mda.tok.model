item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview fiscal was a year of change for the company 
the company initiated a review of strategic alternatives in july in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced it had entered into a stock purchase agreement the stock purchase agreement for the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary new albertsons  inc nai  resulting in the sale of the albertsons  acme  jewel osco  shaw s and star market stores and related osco and sav on in store pharmacies collectively  the nai banners  to ab acquisition  llc  ab acquisition  an affiliate of a cerberus capital management  lp cerberus led consortium which also includes kimco realty  klaff realty lp  lubert adler partners and schottenstein real estate group the nai banner sale 
the nai banner sale closed on march  marking a significant milestone for the year old company 
as a result  supervalu enters fiscal as a more focused wholesale and retail grocery business having achieved revenues of more than billion in fiscal on a continuing operations basis 
the company appointed a new leadership team  including new president and chief executive officer  sam duncan  and non executive chairman  robert miller 
this new executive team is implementing a decentralized operating model focused on simplifying operations and placing more authority and accountability at the retail banner and independent business region level 
going forward  the company consists of three primary businesses independent business  save a lot and retail food 
independent business  which serves as the primary supplier to nearly  of stores operated by independent retailers  will be the company s largest reportable segment in terms of sales 
save a lot continues to be the company s market leading hard discount format with more than  stores and considerable opportunities for growth 
with more than of its stores owned and operated by independent licensees  save a lot has a unique business proposition that includes growth opportunities for both corporate and licensee owned locations 
the company s retail food segment  although smaller following the nai banner sale  has established  traditional grocery stores spread across five regional banners 
the company remains committed to growing its quality  private label products and expanding its largest brand offering  essential everyday  to fuel growth 
last year  the company introduced approximately new products across its private brand portfolio  as well as introduced essential everyday as the primary private brand serving the company s  independent retail stores 
these products help differentiate the company from its competition while providing important value offerings to customers 
private brands will continue to be an emphasis for the company in fiscal longer term  the company has plans to increase sales and operating cash flow  improve its balance sheet  and generate returns for its stockholders 
fiscal will be a transition year for the company  as it transitions through the nai banner sale 
this transition is expected to affect results for continuing operations as the company implements a new decentralized business model under the guidance of new senior management 
the company will continue to be challenged by the slow rate of economic improvement and historically low levels of consumer confidence as it seeks to reverse negative same store sales trends 
management expects that consumer spending will continue to be pressured by the overall economic environment and that operating results for the company will be impacted as consumers continue to seek greater value offerings in a highly competitive and price sensitive marketplace 
in connection with the stock purchase agreement  the company has entered into various agreements with regard to on going operations  including a transition services agreement with each of nai and albertson s llc and operating and supply agreements 
the initial terms of these arrangements vary from months to years  are generally subject to renewal upon mutual agreement by the parties thereto and also include termination provisions that can be exercised by each party 
in addition  on march   the company announced plans to reduce its national workforce by an estimated  positions  including current positions and open jobs 
these reductions will predominantly occur during the company s first and second quarter of fiscal results of operations the following discussion summarizes operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the nai banner sale  the company has classified the operations attributable to nai as discontinued operations for all fiscal years presented

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
vendor funds the company receives funds from many of the vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these vendor funds are provided to increase the sell through of the related products 
the company receives vendor funds for a variety of merchandising activities placement of the vendors products in the company s advertising  display of the vendors products in prominent locations in the company s stores  supporting the introduction of new products into the company s retail stores and distribution system  exclusivity rights in certain categories  and to compensate for temporary price reductions offered to customers on products held for sale at retail stores 
the company also receives vendor funds for buying activities such as volume commitment rebates  credits for purchasing products in advance of their need and cash discounts for the early payment of merchandise purchases 
the majority of the vendor fund contracts have terms of less than a year  with a small proportion of the contracts longer than one year 
the company recognizes vendor funds for merchandising activities as a reduction of cost of sales when the related products are sold 
vendor funds that have been earned as a result of completing the required performance under the terms of the underlying agreements but for which the product has not yet been sold are recognized as reductions of inventory 
the amount and timing of recognition of vendor funds as well as the amount of vendor funds to be recognized as a reduction to ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates 
management determines these amounts based on estimates of current year purchase volume using forecast and historical data and review of average inventory turnover data 
these judgments and estimates impact the company s reported gross profit  operating earnings loss and inventory amounts 
the historical estimates of the company have been reliable in the past  and the company believes the methodology will continue to be reliable in the future 
based on previous experience  the company does not expect significant changes in the level of vendor support 
however  if such changes were to occur  cost of sales and advertising expense could change  depending on the specific vendors involved 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would consider changing the volume  type and frequency of the advertising  which could increase or decrease its advertising expense 
similarly  the company is not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on increasing revenues as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for the company s stores 
for fiscal  a percent change in total vendor funds earned  including advertising allowances  with no offsetting changes to the base price on the products purchased  would impact gross profit by less than basis points 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all of the company s inventory consists of finished goods 
the company uses one of either replacement cost  weighted average cost  or the retail inventory method rim to value discrete inventory items at lower of cost or market before application of any last in  first out lifo reserve 
as of february  and february   approximately percent of the company s inventories were valued under the lifo method 
as of february  and february   approximately percent and percent  respectively  of the company s inventories were valued under the replacement cost method before application of any lifo reserve 
the weighted average cost and rim methods of inventory valuation together comprised approximately percent and percent of inventory as of february  and february   respectively  before application of any lifo reserve 
under the replacement cost method applied on a lifo basis  the most recent purchase cost is used to calculate the current cost of inventory before application of any lifo reserve 
the replacement cost approach results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market because of the high inventory turnover and the resulting low inventory days supply on hand combined with infrequent vendor price changes for these items of inventory 
the company uses one of either cost  weighted average cost  rim or replacement cost to value certain discrete inventory items under the first in  first out method fifo 
the replacement cost approach under the fifo method is predominantly utilized in determining the value of high turnover perishable items  including produce  deli  bakery  meat and floral 
as of february  and february   approximately percent and percent  respectively  of the company s inventories were valued using the cost  weighted average cost and rim methods under the fifo method of inventory accounting 
the remaining percent and percent of the company s inventories as of february  and february   respectively  were valued using the replacement cost approach under the fifo method of inventory accounting 
the replacement cost approach applied under the fifo method results in inventories recorded at the lower of cost or market because of the very high inventory turnover and the resulting low inventory days supply for these items of inventory 
during fiscal  and  inventory quantities in certain lifo layers were reduced 
these reductions resulted in a liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of fiscal  and purchases 
as a result  cost of sales decreased by  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
if the fifo method had been used to determine cost of inventories for which the lifo method is used  the company s inventories would have been higher by approximately and as of february  and february   respectively 

table of contents the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout each fiscal year based on actual physical counts in its facilities 
allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the end of each fiscal year 
long lived assets the company monitors the recoverability of its long lived assets such as buildings and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable  including current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or the company s plans for store closures 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  a recoverability test is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the group of assets being tested 
if impairment is identified for long lived assets to be held and used  the fair value is compared to the carrying value of the group of assets and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
for long lived assets that are classified as assets held for sale  the company recognizes impairment charges for the excess of the carrying value plus estimated costs of disposal over the estimated fair value 
fair value is based on current market values or discounted future cash flows using level inputs 
the company estimates fair value based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers 
the company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset groups included only future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
long lived asset impairment charges are a component of selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company groups long lived assets with other assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets  which historically has been at the geographic market level 
the company reviewed its long lived asset grouping policy during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the review  the company determined it would be more appropriate to evaluate long lived assets for impairment at the store level for certain geographic markets within the save a lot segment which continued to show higher indicators of economic decline  and which led to revised operating market strategies 
the company determined that impairment of the long lived assets within this asset group had occurred based on reviewing estimated cash flows  which were less than their carrying values 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  based upon the results of impairment testing which indicated the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the revised asset group  the company recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of approximately related to a store level impairment review and a charge related to a geographic market in the company s save a lot segment 
due to the ongoing business transformation and highly competitive environment  the company will continue to evaluate its long lived asset policy and current asset groups  to determine if additional modifications to the policy are necessary 
future changes to the company s assessment of its long lived asset policy and changes in circumstances  operating results or other events may result in additional asset impairment testing and charges 
during fiscal  the company announced the closure of approximately non strategic stores within the save a lot segment including the exit of a geographic market  resulting in an impairment of related to these stores long lived assets 
in addition  the company recorded an impairment charge of in the independent business segment  based upon the results of impairment testing which indicated the carrying value exceeded the fair value of a distribution center held and used in operations 
refer to note reserves for closed properties property  plant and equipment related impairment charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information on reserve for closed properties and property  plant and equipment related impairment charges 
the company recognized property  plant and equipment related impairment charges of  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the executive management team determined the company would abandon certain capital projects in process  mainly related to software under development  and would cease use of certain other software support tools  all within the retail food segment  resulting in an impairment of reserves for closed properties and property  plant and equipment related impairment charges the company maintains reserves for costs associated with closures of retail stores  distribution centers and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
the company provides for closed property operating lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  reduced by estimated subtenant rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
the closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms  which generally range from one to years 
the company estimates subtenant rentals and future cash flows based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 

table of contents owned properties  capital lease properties and the related equipment and leasehold improvements at operating leased properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers to assist in the valuation 
the expectations on timing of disposition and the estimated sales price or subtenant rentals associated with closed properties  owned or leased  are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy  resultant demand for commercial property  the ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
while management believes the current estimates of reserves for closed properties and related impairment charges are adequate  it is possible that market and economic conditions in the real estate market could cause changes in the company s assumptions and may require additional reserves and asset impairment charges to be recorded 
the company s reserve for closed properties was  net of estimated sublease recoveries of  as of february   and  net of estimated sublease recoveries of  as of february  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives goodwill goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test is performed using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any that should be recorded 
in the second step  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the company s determination of reporting units considers the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of aggregation of each of the components within the retail food  save a lot and independent business operating segments 
the significant qualitative and economic characteristics used in determining our components to support their aggregation include types of businesses and the manner in which the components operate  consideration of key impacts to net sales  cost of sales  competitive risks and the extent to which components share assets and other resources 
the company s reporting units are the operating segments of the business which consist of retail food  save a lot  and independent business 
goodwill was assigned to the reporting units as of the acquisition date  with no amounts being allocated between reporting units 
the company s retail food reporting unit is comprised of the aggregation of five traditional retail food store components under a variety of banners shoppers  hornbacher s  farm fresh  cub foods  and shop n save 
the company s hard discount stores reporting unit is comprised of a single component under one banner save a lot 
the independent business reporting unit is comprised of the aggregation of four geographic distribution areas  which are organized based on region components eastern  southeast  midwest and northern 
the fair values of the company s reporting units are determined by using both the market approach  applying a multiple of earnings based on guidelines for publicly traded companies  and the income approach  discounting projected future cash flows based on management s expectations of the current and future operating environment 
the rates used to discount projected future cash flows reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on the company s industry  capital structure and risk premiums including those reflected in the current market capitalization 
fair value calculations contain significant judgments and estimates related to each reporting unit s projected weighted average cost of capital  future revenue  profitability  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
when preparing these estimates  management considers each reporting unit s historical results  current operating trends and specific plans in place 
these estimates are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy and market competition 
the company has sufficient current and historical information available to support its judgments and estimates 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates future operating results may be materially impacted 

table of contents the company s goodwill attributable to each reporting unit consisted of the following reporting unit retail food save a lot independent business the company performed its annual test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal  utilizing discount rates ranging between percent and percent to discount projected future cash flows for each reporting unit and perpetual growth rates ranged between percent and percent 
management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flow analysis utilizing alternate assumptions that reflect reasonably possible changes to future assumptions 
based upon the company s analysis of the independent business and save a lot reporting units  a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis would not have resulted in either reporting unit failing step one of the impairment test 
additionally  a basis point decrease in the estimated perpetual sales growth rates utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis would not have resulted in either reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment tests 
the fair value of goodwill for the company s save a lot reporting was in excess of percent of the carrying value 
the fair value of the company s independent business reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent 
if the company s stock price experiences a significant and sustained decline  or other events or changes in circumstances  such as operating results not meeting plan indicate that impairment may have occurred  the company would reassess the fair value of the implied goodwill compared to the carrying value 
the company completed step one of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter for fiscal with each reporting unit s fair value exceeding its carrying value 
accordingly  step two of the impairment analysis was not required for fiscal during fiscal and  the company recorded a non cash impairment charges of and  respectively in the retail food segment as a result of the annual goodwill impairment test 
the impairment charge resulted from the significant and sustained decline in the company s market capitalization 
as of year end there was no remaining goodwill related to the retail food segment 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives the company reviews intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  which primarily consist of trademarks and tradenames  for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired 
the impairment review consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value 
fair value is measured using the relief from royalty method 
fair values of the company s trademarks and tradenames are determined primarily by discounting an assumed royalty value applied to projected future revenues associated with the tradename based on management s expectations of the current and future operating environment 
the royalty cash flows are discounted using rates based on the weighted average cost of capital and the specific risk profile of the tradenames relative to the company s other assets 
these estimates are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy and market competition 
the company completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal for those intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
an impairment charge of was recorded related to tradenames during the fourth quarter of fiscal those charges were recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other postretirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or termination 
effective december   the company authorized amendments to the supervalu retirement plan and certain supplemental executive retirement benefit plans whereby service crediting ended in these plans and no employees will become eligible to participate in these plans after december  pay increases continued to be reflected in the amount of benefit earned in these plans until december  the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc  compensation retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost 
asc requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is a component of stockholders equity 
while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 

table of contents the determination of the company s obligation and related expense for company sponsored pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent  in part  on management s selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
refer to note benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 
the company reviews and selects the discount rate to be used in connection with its pension and other postretirement obligations annually 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits 
the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined based on the portfolio s actual and target composition  current market conditions  forward looking return and risk assumptions by asset class  and historical long term investment performance 
the year annual average rate of return on pension assets for fiscal and fiscal are lower than the assumed long term rate of return of and percent due to the unprecedented decline in the economy and the credit market turmoil during fiscal and the year rolling average annualized return for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations have generated average returns of approximately percent based on returns from to the company expects that the markets will recover to the assumed long term rate of return 
in accordance with accounting standards  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense and obligations in future periods 
at february   the company converted to the static mortality table for annuitants and non annuitants for calculating the pension and postretirement obligations and the fiscal expense 
the impact of this change increased the february  projected benefit obligation by and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by this change increased the fiscal defined benefit pension plans expense by the static mortality table for annuitants and non annuitants is published annually and reflects a static projection of mortality improvements which are projected forward each year 
the company used the static mortality table for annuitants and non annuitants to calculate the pension and postretirement obligations 
during  the company contributed to its defined benefit pension plans 
in addition the company contributed to its postretirement benefit plans in fiscal  and expects to contribute approximately to its defined benefit pension plans and approximately to its postretirement benefit plans in fiscal for fiscal  each basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately and each basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately similarly  for postretirement benefits  a basis point increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of the end of fiscal  by approximately and would increase service and interest cost by conversely  a basis point decrease in the healthcare cost trend rate would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of the end of fiscal by approximately and would decrease service and interest cost by although the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate  the actuarial assumptions may differ from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
income taxes the company s current and deferred tax provision is based on estimates and assumptions that could materially differ from the actual results reflected in its income tax returns filed during the subsequent year and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse 
the company s effective tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
management s judgment is involved in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions 
in addition  the company is currently in various stages of audits  appeals or other methods of review with taxing authorities from various taxing jurisdictions 
the company establishes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when  despite management s belief that the company s tax return positions are supportable  certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised 
the company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
the effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to those reserves 
the company also provides interest on these liabilities at the appropriate statutory interest rate 
the actual benefits ultimately realized for tax positions may differ from the company s estimates due to changes in facts  circumstances and new information 
as of february  and february   the company had and of unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 

table of contents the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that it is more likely than not to realize 
forecasted earnings  future taxable income and future prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company was not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  the valuation allowance would be increased 
likewise  if it was determined that the company was more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  the applicable portion of the valuation allowance would reverse 
the company had a valuation allowance of  and as of february  and february   respectively 
included in discontinued operations is the recognition of the additional tax basis in the shares of nai offset by a valuation allowance on the estimated capital loss  as there is no current evidence that the capital loss will be used prior to its expiration 
self insurance liabilities the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  healthcare for certain employees and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on management s estimate of the ultimate cost of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported and related expenses  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
in determining its self insurance liabilities  the company performs a continuing review of its overall position and reserving techniques 
since recorded amounts are based on estimates  the ultimate cost of all incurred claims and related expenses may be more or less than the recorded liabilities 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  healthcare and general and automobile liability is subject to a degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  regulatory changes  benefit level changes and actual claim settlement patterns 
if  in the future  the company were to experience significant volatility in the amount and timing of cash payments compared to its earlier estimates  the company would assess whether to continue to discount these liabilities 
the company had self insurance liabilities of approximately  net of the discount of  and  net of the discount of  as of february  and february   respectively 
as of february   each basis point change in the discount rate would impact the self insurance liabilities by less than prior to the nai banner sale  the majority of the self insurance liability for workers compensation was related to claims occurring in california 
as a result of the nai banner sale and the retention of liability for california self insurance liabilities related to workers compensation by nai  the company has significantly reduced the extent of self insurance obligations 
liquidity and capital resources management expects that the company will continue to replenish operating assets and pay down debt obligations with internally generated funds 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels 
a significant reduction in operating earnings or the incurrence of operating losses in one or more quarterly periods could have a negative impact on the company s operating cash flow  which would limit the company s ability to pay down its outstanding indebtedness as planned 
the company s primary source of liquidity is from internally generated funds and borrowings under its credit facilities 
to the extent that the company s inventory levels decline as a result of reduced cash flow from operations  the company s borrowing capacity under its credit facilities would also decline 
reduced liquidity could also result in less favorable trade terms with vendors and other third parties 
long term financing will be maintained through existing and new debt issuances and credit facilities 
the company s short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures as opportunities arise 
maturities of debt issued will depend on management s views with respect to the relative attractiveness of interest rates at the time of issuance and other debt maturities

fiscal total defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan contributions are estimated to be approximately to liquidity requirements subsequent to the refinancing transactions  the company has approximately  and in aggregate debt maturities due in fiscal  and  respectively

at the company s discretion  additional funds may be contributed to the pension plan 
the company may accelerate contributions or undertake contributions in excess of the minimum requirements from time to time subject to the availability of cash in excess of operating and financing needs or other factors as may be applicable 
the company assesses the relative attractiveness of the use of cash including expected return on assets  discount rates  cost of debt  reducing or eliminating required pbgc variable rate premiums or in order to achieve exemption from participant notices of underfunding 
in addition  the company has entered into an agreement with the pbgc relating to the nai banner sale where it has agreed to contribute in excess of the minimum required amounts by additional contributions of by the end of fiscal  an additional by the end of fiscal and an additional by the end of fiscal off balance sheet arrangements guarantees the company has guaranteed certain leases  fixture financing loans and other debt obligations of various retailers as of february  these guarantees were generally made to support the business growth of independent retail customers 
the guarantees are generally for the entire terms of the leases or other debt obligations with remaining terms that range from less than one year to years  with a weighted average remaining term of approximately nine years 
for each guarantee issued  if the independent retail customer defaults on a payment  the company would be required to make payments under its guarantee 
generally  the guarantees are secured by indemnification agreements or personal guarantees of the independent retail customer 
the company reviews performance risk related to its guarantees of independent retail customers based on internal measures of credit performance 
as of february   the maximum amount of undiscounted payments the company would be required to make in the event of default of all guarantees was and represented on a discounted basis 
based on the indemnification agreements  personal guarantees and results of the reviews of performance risk  the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
accordingly  no amount has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheets for these contingent obligations under the company s guarantee arrangements 
the company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
the company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of the company s assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available  the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
the company has guaranteed the obligations of american stores company asc under the asc indenture which total notes outstanding 
as part of the nai banner sale  ab acquisition assumed the asc debt but the existing guarantee as provided to the asc bondholders will not be released and the company continues as guarantor 
concurrently with the close of the nai banner sale  ab acquisition  entered into an agreement with the company to indemnify the company for any consideration used to satisfy the guarantee by depositing into an escrow account  which gives the company first priority interest and the trustee of the asc bondholders second priority interest in the collateral balance 

table of contents the company is a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which the company may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters  which indemnities may be secured by operation of law or otherwise  in the ordinary course of business 
these contracts primarily relate to the company s commercial contracts  operating leases and other real estate contracts  financial agreements  agreements to provide services to the company and agreements to indemnify officers  directors and employees in the performance of their work 
while the company s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability  the company is not aware of any matters that are expected to result in a material liability 
multiemployer plans the company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements  primarily defined benefit pension plans 
these multiemployer plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose 
plan trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as the investment of the assets and plan administration 
trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions parties to the collective bargaining agreement 
expense is recognized in connection with these plans as contributions are funded  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company made contributions to these plans  and recognized expense  of  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
company contributions to these plans could increase in the near term 
however  the amount of any increase or decrease in contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including the results of the company s collective bargaining efforts  investment returns on the assets held in the plans  actions taken by the trustees who manage the plans and requirements under the pension protection act and section e of the internal revenue code 
furthermore  if the company were to significantly reduce contributions  exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans  it could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal that would require the company to fund its proportionate share of a plan s unfunded vested benefits 
based on the assessment of the most recent information available  the company believes that most of the multiemployer plans to which it contributes are underfunded 
the company is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans and the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of the company 
however  the company has attempted  as of february   to estimate its proportionate share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which the company contributes  based on the ratio of its contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year 
as of february   the estimate of the company s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which it contributes was  pre tax  or  after tax 
this represents an increase in the estimated proportionate share of the underfunding of approximately  pre tax  or  after tax  as of february   compared to february  the increase in the company s proportionate share of underfunding is attributable to the changes in contribution rates resulting from renegotiated collective bargaining agreements  lower than anticipated return on assets and benefit payments in relation to contributions received 
the estimate is based on the most current information available to the company including actuarial evaluations and other data  and may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 
company contributions can fluctuate from year to year due to store closures and reductions in headcount 
in fiscal  the company contributions to multiemployer pension plans were unchanged over the prior year 
in fiscal  the company expects to contribute approximately to to the multiemployer pension plans  subject to the outcome of collective bargaining and capital market conditions 
furthermore  if the company were to significantly reduce contributions  exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans  it could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal that would require the company to record a withdrawal liability 
any withdrawal liability would be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting standards 
the company s proportionate share of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on the results of collective bargaining efforts  investment returns on the assets held in the plans  actions taken by trustees who manage the plans benefit payments and requirements under the pension protection act of and section e of the internal revenue code 
the company also makes contributions to multiemployer health and welfare plans in amounts set forth in the related collective bargaining agreements 
a small minority of collective bargaining agreements contain reserve requirements that may trigger unanticipated contributions resulting in increased healthcare expenses 
if these healthcare provisions cannot be renegotiated in a manner that reduces the prospective healthcare cost as the company intends  the company s selling and administrative expenses could increase in the future
