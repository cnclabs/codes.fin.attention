item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general unless the context indicates otherwise  when we refer to we  us  our or the company in this form k  we are referring to guess  inc and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
business segments the company businesses are grouped into five reportable segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes europe  north american retail  asia  north american wholesale and licensing 
information regarding these segments is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates segment performance based primarily on revenues and earnings from operations 
the company believes this segment reporting reflects how its five business segments are managed and each segment performance is evaluated 
the europe segment includes the company wholesale and retail operations in europe and the middle east 
the north american retail segment includes the company retail operations in north america 
the asia segment includes the company wholesale and retail operations in asia 
the north american wholesale segment includes the company wholesale operations in north america and export sales to central and south america 
the licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the company 
the business segment operating results exclude corporate overhead costs  which consist of shared costs of the organization 
these costs are presented separately and generally include  among other things  the following unallocated corporate costs information technology  human resources  global advertising and marketing  accounting and finance  executive compensation  facilities and legal 
products we derive our net revenue from the sale of guess  marciano  guess kids and g by guess men s and women s apparel and our licensees products through our worldwide network of retail stores  wholesale customers and distributors  as well as our on line sites 
we also derive royalty revenues from worldwide licensing activities 
recent global economic developments economic and market conditions have continued to be volatile and uncertain in many markets around the world and consumer behavior remains cautious 
in north america  the relatively weaker levels of consumer confidence and the highly promotional conditions among retailers may persist for some time 
in europe  sovereign debt issues  government austerity programs  and bank credit issues continue to affect the capital markets of numerous european countries  resulting in reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending in those countries 
these circumstances have had  and are expected to continue to have  a negative impact on our business  particularly in our more mature markets in southern europe 
these conditions could have a greater impact in our multi brand wholesale channel  particularly in italy  where many customers are relatively small and not well capitalized 
the company experienced some inflationary pressures on raw materials  labor  freight and other commodities  including oil  in fiscal and during the first half of fiscal foreign currency volatility we continue to experience significant volatility in the global currency markets 
since the majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro  canadian dollar and korean won  currency fluctuations can have a significant impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings into us dollar amounts 
during fiscal  the average us dollar rate was stronger against these currencies versus the average rate in fiscal this had an overall negative impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings for the fiscal year ended february  compared to the prior fiscal year 

table of contents in addition  some of our transactions that occur in europe  canada and south korea are denominated in us dollars  swiss francs and british pounds  exposing them to exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the operating margins of our foreign operations and reported earnings and are largely dependent on the transaction timing and magnitude during the period that the currency fluctuates 
on average  the euro was weaker versus the us dollar during fiscal than during fiscal  increasing the cost of us dollar denominated purchases of merchandise in our european operations 
if the euro continues to weaken versus the us dollar in fiscal  our product margins in europe could continue to be unfavorably impacted 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on foreign currency transactions 
for additional discussion regarding our exposure to foreign currency risk  forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges and forward contracts not designated as cash flow hedges  refer to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk strategy international growth

our discussion and analysis above also includes certain constant currency financial information 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amount reported from translating the company s foreign revenues and expenses into us dollars 
these rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results under gaap 
the company provides constant currency information to help investors assess how our businesses performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates 
to calculate revenues and earnings 
table of contents from operations on a constant currency basis  operating results for the current year period for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year 
the constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate 
the constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
liquidity and capital resources we need liquidity primarily to fund our working capital  the expansion and remodeling of our retail stores  shop in shop programs  concessions  systems  infrastructure  other existing operations  international growth  potential acquisitions  potential share repurchases and payment of dividends to our stockholders 
during the fiscal year ended february   the company relied primarily on trade credit  available cash  real estate leases  and internally generated funds to finance our operations and expansion 
the company anticipates that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements during the next twelve months for working capital  capital expenditures  interest and principal payments on our debt  potential acquisitions  potential share repurchases and any dividend payments to stockholders  primarily with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances supplemented by borrowings  as necessary  under our existing credit facility and bank facilities in europe  as described below under credit facilities

approximately of the company s cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the us as of february   we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  since such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
if in the future we decide to repatriate such earnings  we would incur incremental us federal and state income tax  reduced by allowable foreign tax credits 
however  our intent is to keep these funds indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and our current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
excess cash and cash equivalents  which represent the majority of our outstanding cash and cash equivalents balance  are held primarily in overnight deposit and short term time deposit accounts and four diversified money market funds 
the money market funds are aaa rated by national credit rating agencies and are generally comprised of high quality  liquid investments

risk factors for a discussion of risk factors which could reasonably be likely to result in a decrease of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the company has presented below the cash flow performance comparison of the year ended february   versus the year ended january  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended february   compared to million for the fiscal year ended january   or a decrease of million 
the decrease was driven by lower net earnings for fiscal versus the prior year  the receipt of a fixed cash rights payment of million from one of our licensees during the prior year and the unfavorable impact of changes in working capital 
these decreases were partially offset by higher non cash adjustments for fiscal the change in working capital was driven primarily by the timing of payments to purchase inventory  partially offset by the timing of certain prepayments compared to the prior year 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended february   compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  cash used in investing activities related primarily to the expansion of our europe and north american retail businesses  capital expenditures incurred on existing store remodeling programs in north america and investments in information systems 
in addition  the cost of any 
table of contents business acquisitions and the settlement of forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges are also included in cash flows used in investing activities 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities related primarily to a lower level of spending on new store expansion in north america and net cash receipts for settlement of forward contracts during the fiscal year ended february  compared to net payments for settlement of forward contracts in the prior year

financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended february   compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the payment of a special dividend in fiscal of per common share and higher repurchases of shares of the company s common stock during fiscal effect of exchange rates on cash during the fiscal year ended february   changes in foreign currency translation rates increased our reported cash and cash equivalents balance by million 
this compares to a decrease of million in cash and cash equivalents driven by changes in foreign currency translation rates during the fiscal year ended january  working capital at february   the company had working capital including cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at january  the lower net working capital is due primarily to repurchases of the company common shares during fiscal at an aggregate cost of million and the payment of a special dividend in fiscal of per common share

inflation the company experienced some inflationary pressures on raw materials  labor  freight and other commodities  including oil  in fiscal and during the first half of fiscal however  the company does not believe that inflation trends in the us and internationally over the last three years have had a significant effect on net revenue or profitability 
seasonality the company s business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries 
the us  european and canadian retail operations are generally stronger during the second half of the fiscal year  and the us and canadian wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance from july through november 
the european wholesale businesses operate with two primary selling seasons the spring summer season  which ships from november to april and the fall winter season  which ships from may to october

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  sales return allowances  loyalty and gift card accruals  pension obligations  the useful life of assets for depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of asset impairment  litigation reserves  recoverability of deferred taxes  unrecognized tax benefits  workers compensation and medical self insurance expense and accruals and share based compensation 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
in addition to the accounting policies mentioned below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable reserves in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis is performed based on financial and other criteria 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and whether the company has obtained credit insurance or other guarantees 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to revenues  and any unapplied amounts are included in the allowance for accounts receivable 
historically  these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the company s wholesale customers  as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
sales returns reserves the company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
to recognize the financial impact of sales returns  the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly 
the company s policy allows retail customers in certain regions a grace period to return merchandise following the date of sale 
substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost primarily weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for each product line category  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions  available liquidation channels and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
the company closely monitors off price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates 
estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets ie  goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
for goodwill  determination of impairment is made at the reporting unit level 
for long lived assets other than goodwill  the company considers each individual store as an asset group for impairment testing  which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
the asset group includes store leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  computer hardware and software and certain long term security deposits and lease acquisition costs 
the company reviews retail stores for impairment risk once the locations have been opened for at least one year  or sooner as changes in circumstances require 
the company believes that waiting one year allows a store to reach a maturity level where a more comprehensive analysis of financial performance can be performed 
an asset is considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the company strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred 
if the assets other than goodwill are assessed to be recoverable  they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset 
we use various assumptions in determining current fair market value of these assets  including future expected cash flows and discount rates 
future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life  if shorter 
the company considers historical trends  expected future business trends and other factors when estimating each store future cash flow 
the company also considers factors such as the local environment for each store location  including mall traffic and competition  the company ability to successfully implement strategic initiatives  and the ability to control variable costs such as cost of sales and payroll  and in some cases  renegotiate lease costs 
if actual results are 
table of contents not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the authoritative guidance framework 
the life expectancy  estimated retirement age  discount rate and estimated future compensation are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for supplemental executive retirement plan related information 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected probable favorable or unfavorable outcome of each claim 
as additional information becomes available  the company assesses the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revises estimates as appropriate 
as new claims arise or existing claims evolve  such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
share based compensation the company recognizes compensation expense for all share based awards granted based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for new grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant 
the expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility 
implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the company common stock 
the expected life used prior to november was based on the simplified method described in authoritative guidance 
for options granted beginning november  the expected term is determined based on historical trends 
the expected dividend yield is based on the company history and expectations of dividend payouts 
the expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data 
compensation expense for nonvested stock options and stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in addition  the company has granted certain nonvested stock awards and stock options in the past that require the recipient to achieve certain minimum performance targets in order for these awards to vest 
if the minimum performance targets have not been achieved or are not expected to be achieved  no expense is recognized during the period 
income taxes the company adopted authoritative guidance which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
guidance was also provided on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as required under applicable accounting rules  the company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional income tax liability which the company  more likely than not  could incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of income tax audits uncertain tax positions 
the company reviews and updates the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  upon completion of tax audits  upon expiration of statutes of limitation  or upon occurrence of other events 
the results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits 

table of contents deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized 
as all earnings from the company s wholly owned foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed  the company s income tax provision does not include additional us taxes on foreign operations 
hedge accounting the company operates in foreign countries  which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company has entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules in accordance with authoritative guidance for certain of these hedges 
the company s objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk 
various transactions that occur in canada  europe and south korea are denominated in us dollars and british pounds and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies 
these types of transactions include us dollar denominated purchases of merchandise and us dollar and british pound denominated intercompany liabilities 
in addition  certain operating expenses and tax liabilities are denominated in swiss francs and are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on certain of these anticipated foreign currency transactions 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity  and are recognized in cost of product sales or other income and expenses in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold or the hedged intercompany liability is incurred 
the company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expense 
gift card breakage gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods 
estimated breakage amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed 
the company determined a gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns  which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the inception of the electronic gift card program in late any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the recognition of gift card breakage 
loyalty programs the company launched customer loyalty programs for its g by guess  guess and marciano stores in july  august and september  respectively 
the guess and marciano loyalty programs were merged in may under the programs  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may only be redeemed for merchandise 
in all of the programs  unredeemed points generally expire after six months without additional purchase activity and unredeemed awards generally expire after two months 
due to the relative newness of the programs  prior to fiscal  all unexpired  unredeemed points and awards were accrued in current liabilities and recorded as a reduction of net sales as points and awards were accumulated by the member 
in fiscal  based on the accumulation of multiple cycles of actual redemptions experienced since inception of the programs  the company revised its approach to estimate the value of future award redemptions under the existing loyalty program by incorporating historical redemption rates 
in connection with this revision  the company recorded a 
table of contents cumulative adjustment of million in fiscal to increase net revenue and to adjust the current liability balance to an amount reflecting estimated future award redemptions 
this adjustment had a favorable impact of per share in fiscal the aggregate dollar value of the loyalty program accruals included in accrued expenses was million and million at february  and january   respectively 
future revisions to the estimated liability may result in changes to net revenue 
recently issued accounting guidance in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements

in addition  certain operating expenses and tax liabilities are denominated in swiss francs and are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on certain of these anticipated foreign currency transactions 
in addition  some of the derivative contracts in place will create volatility during the fiscal year as they are marked to market according to the accounting rules and may result in revaluation gains or losses in different periods from when the currency impact on the underlying transactions are realized 
forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges during fiscal  the company purchased us dollar forward contracts in europe and canada totaling us million and us million  respectively  to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and intercompany royalties that were designated as cash flow hedges 
as of february   the company had forward contracts outstanding for its european and canadian operations of us million and us million  respectively  which are expected to mature over the next months 
the company s derivative financial instruments are recorded in its consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market rates
