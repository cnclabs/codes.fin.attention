item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form k 
certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes 
certain amounts in the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
executive level overview results our results reflect what we believe was above market sales growth in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments and below market growth in our americas reporting segment in the musculoskeletal markets in which we compete 
as a result  net sales were flat when compared to we believe net sales reflected strong commercial execution in the europe and asia pacific reporting segments and under performance in some areas of the americas reporting segment 
we are focusing on improving those areas 
during  we made substantial investments in a series of operational excellence initiatives 
we began implementing these initiatives on a company wide basis in they are intended to improve our future operating results and include centralizing or outsourcing certain functions  improving quality  distribution  sourcing  manufacturing and our information technology systems 
we began realizing savings from these operational initiatives in as indicated in the basis point decline in our selling  general and administrative sg a expense as a percent of sales 
additionally  research and development r d spending was lower in as we completed certain significant projects and realized some operational savings from these initiatives 
we also recognized unanticipated expenses in for goodwill impairment related to our us spine operations and certain claims 
however  this was partially offset by a favorable effective tax rate 
we recorded a million net tax benefit related to restructuring of certain international operations that resulted in the lower tax rate 
in total  our net earnings were slightly lower than primarily due to the significant investments in our operational excellence initiatives and were lower than we expected primarily due to the goodwill impairment 
outlook we estimate our net sales will grow between and percent in this assumes the market for knee and hip procedures will remain stable and grow in low single digits 
we expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth of approximately percent  and foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative effect on sales growth of approximately percent based upon december  rates 
assuming currency rates remain at december  levels  we expect our gross margin to be between and percent of sales in this range assumes that foreign currency hedge losses will be lower in than in the range also takes into consideration the impact of the new percent excise tax on a majority of our us sales resulting from us healthcare reform 
pursuant to the tax regulations  the excise tax is imposed on the first sale in the us by the manufacturer  producer or importer of a medical device to either a third party or an affiliated distribution entity 
we distribute a majority of our musculoskeletal products through an affiliated distribution entity 
under us gaap  excise taxes incurred to get inventory to its current location can be included in the cost of the inventory 
accordingly  a majority of the excise tax will be capitalized in inventory and the expense will be deferred until that inventory is sold on a first in first out basis 
therefore  while we started paying the tax in january  it will not significantly increase our cost of products sold expense in our consolidated statement of earnings until later in the year 
once our cost of products sold starts reflecting this excise tax  we estimate the cost to be to million on a quarterly basis 
the range of to percent does not take into consideration inventory step up or other inventory charges related to acquisitions or operational excellence initiatives in we do not expect to be able to offset the full impact of the excise tax on net earnings through higher pricing on our products or through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage 
however  we do expect to offset the tax with cost savings from our operational excellence initiatives 
we expect to continue making investments in r d of approximately percent of sales in sg a as a percent of sales is expected to be between and percent in as we realize efficiencies from our operational excellence initiatives and further leverage revenue growth 
we expect to incur to million of expenses in related to our operational excellence initiatives 
these programs are targeted at streamlining the organization and business processes 
they are expected to be mostly completed in we also expect to incur to million for certain acquisition and integration costs connected with recent acquisitions 
we expect to recognize the majority of these expenses in special items on our statement of earnings  but some will be related to inventory and be reflected in costs of products sold 
the gross margin and sg a percentages discussed above do not include these expenses 
assuming variable interest rates remain at december  levels  we expect interest income and expense  net  to be approximately million in  which is similar to

form k annual report demand volume and mix trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed percentage points of sales growth  which is the same rate of growth from compared to consistent with our expectations  procedure volumes in the broader musculoskeletal market remained stable in relative to at low to mid single digit growth rates 
we believe long term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population  growth in emerging markets  obesity  proven clinical benefits  new material technologies  advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles  among other factors 
in addition  the ongoing shift in demand to premium products and the introduction of patient specific devices is expected to continue to positively affect sales growth 
pricing trends global average selling prices declined by percent in compared to in all reporting segments  we continued to see pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems 
for example  in japan a biennial price adjustment went into effect in april which lowered pricing 
the japan downward price adjustment was greater than we had anticipated coming into the year 
for  we estimate that selling prices will have a negative effect of approximately percent 
foreign currency exchange rates for  foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a percent decline in sales 
this was most notable in europe due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro year over year 
if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with year end rates  we estimate that a stronger us dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect in of approximately percent on sales 
we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk 
changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth  but due to gains losses on hedge contracts and options  which are recorded in cost of products sold  the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 
knees knee sales experienced a percent decline in compared to a percent increase in however  most of that change was caused by the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in europe  changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in and by negative percent and positive percent  respectively 
in asia pacific  changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a minimal effect on knee sales in and had a positive percent effect in we estimate that industry procedure volumes were slightly positive on a global basis in  while pricing was negative 
we also believe our europe and asia pacific reporting segments grew above the market  but in the americas we were lower than the market due to underperformance in some areas 
we are cautiously optimistic that volume mix trends will continue to remain stable in the nexgen complete knee solution product line  including gender solutions knee femoral implants  the nexgen lps flex knee and the nexgen cr flex knee  led knee sales in in addition  sales of our knee revision systems  the zimmer unicompartmental high flex knee and zimmer patient specific instruments exhibited growth 
hips hip sales declined by percent in compared to an increase of percent in a significant portion of that change was caused by the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in europe  changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in and by negative percent and positive percent  respectively 
in asia pacific  changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales in and by percent and percent  respectively 
also  we experienced some specific positive growth drivers in  such as new product introductions and product specific issues at competitors 
without these factors in  our results were more reflective of market growth 
we estimate that industry procedure volumes were slightly positive on a global basis in  while pricing was negative 
sales in were driven primarily by the zimmer m l taper hip prosthesis and the zimmer m l taper hip prosthesis with kinectiv technology  fitmore hip stems  and our continuum acetabular system  trilogy it acetabular system and allofit it alloclassic acetabular system 
other leading products in our hips portfolio were the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweym ller hip stem 
we also commercialized our vivacit e highly crosslinked polyethylene liners in and expect this to drive sales growth in extremities extremities delivered solid sales growth the past two years 
the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system led extremities sales 
reverse shoulder procedures continue to gain popularity as a solution for patients with rotator cuff damage 
dental dental sales declined by percent in compared to an increase of percent in while the americas sales increased in  the overall performance of our dental franchise was impacted by several factors  including softening in certain international markets and lower inventory levels maintained by our stocking distributors 
also  americas sales growth was aided by the acquisition of a small brazilian dental 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report company 
sales were led by the tapered screw vent implant system 
in addition  sales of our recently released zimmer trabecular metal dental implant positively affected sales 
sales were buoyed by a change in a distribution arrangement under which we started capturing end user sales as compared to the prior agreement where we only received a commission on end user sales 
trauma trauma sales increased by percent and percent in and  respectively  compared to the same prior year periods 
in  we continued the launch of the zimmer natural nail system  which contributed significantly to our trauma sales in and in addition to the zimmer natural nail system  the zimmer periarticular locking plates system led trauma sales  while sales of the zimmer universal locking system also made a strong contribution in spine we experienced mid single digit sales declines in spine each of the past two years 
this product category continues to face challenges related to utilization  pricing pressure and payor approvals 
overall  solid sales of the pathfinder nxt and sequoia pedicle screw systems  our universal clamp tm spinal fixation system and trabecular metal technology products partly offset a decline in sales of the dynesys system and other products 
surgical and other surgical and other delivered solid sales growth the past two years 
surgical and other sales were led by palacos bone cement and tourniquet products 
our wound debridement products  powered instruments  denovo nt natural tissue graft  chondrofix osteochondral allograft and gel one cross linked hyaluronate also made a positive contribution to sales results 
additionally  our january acquisition of synvasive technology  inc and october acquisition of dornoch medical systems  inc provided growth in this product category

due to the strengthening of the us dollar in  foreign currency hedge losses in costs of products sold were less in than they were in additionally  lower inventory step up charges from acquisitions were recognized in when compared to based on the timing of acquisitions 
this favorability was offset by the effect of lower prices on gross margin 
gross margin declined in from the most significant impact on gross margin in was from our foreign currency hedging program 
due to the weakening of the us dollar in  we recognized foreign currency hedge losses in costs of products sold versus hedge gains in also in  lower selling prices  higher average costs per unit sold  and higher inventory step up charges all contributed to lower gross margins

changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to lowered sg a expense 
absent the effects of foreign currency exchange rates  selling and distribution expenses were higher due to higher sales 
other unfavorable items included increased intangible amortization from business combinations  higher employee recruiting and relocation costs  increased legal costs and higher bad debt expense 
these were offset by favorable product liability claims  lower instrument excess and obsolescence charges and lower advertising spend

certain claims expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries 
provisions of million  million  million and million were originally recorded during   and  respectively  with an additional million recorded during  bringing the total provision to million for these claims  excluding a subset of durom cup claims that were recorded in sg a 
the additional expense in was primarily for more estimated claims outside the us than were previously expected  as well as higher estimated legal costs 
for more information regarding these claims  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarters of and  we noted that the carrying values of the net assets of our us spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit s estimated fair value 
as a result  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
special items expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
special items in included significant expenses incurred for consulting and professional fees and dedicated project personnel for our operational excellence initiatives 
these initiatives are intended to improve our future operating results and include centralizing or outsourcing certain functions  improving quality  distribution  sourcing  manufacturing and our information technology systems 
other significant expenses in were from impairments from intangible assets acquired in business combinations  settlement of various legal matters  including royalty disputes  and severance expenses related to various organizational changes as well as facility closures 
special items in resulted from a continued reduction in management layers and restructuring in certain areas  resulting in million of severance and termination related expenses 
in  we also incurred million in consulting and professional fees associated with acquisitions and our operational excellence initiatives 
as a result of our acquisitions and operational excellence initiatives  we also incurred asset impairments  facility and employee relocation costs  contract termination expenses and other costs 
special items in included expenses related to restructuring of our information technology infrastructure as well as our management structure 
this resulted in million of asset impairment charges and million of employee severance and termination related expenses 
in  we also incurred consulting and professional fees  facility and employee relocation costs  contract termination expenses and other various expenses resulting from acquisitions 
special items also included the impairment of an available for sale security that was acquired as part of a business acquisition and certain litigation related matters 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding special items charges 
interest income  interest expense  income taxes and net earnings interest expense increased in compared to primarily due to the million offering of senior notes we completed in november interest expense decreased in compared to as the result of interest rate swap agreements we entered into in late and early to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
interest income has increased the last two years due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments upon which interest income is being earned 
our effective tax rate etr on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december   and was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the variation of our etr has largely been affected by certain claims  goodwill impairment charges and a million benefit from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report legal entity restructuring 
certain claims expense favorably affects our etr because it lowers the income within our us operations relative to our foreign operations 
goodwill impairment charges negatively affect our etr because no tax benefit is recorded on such charges 
additionally  in and our etr was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies 
these discrete items account for the majority of the variation in our etrs in the past three years 
our etr for will reflect certain tax benefits resulting from the enactment in january of us federal laws extending the r d credit and other tax benefits applicable to us 
the extension applies to both and  and as a result of the timing of the law s enactment  the tax year benefits must be recognized in the first quarter of for financial reporting purposes 
as a result  our financial results will reflect a reduction to our etr of approximately percent related to the tax year benefits 
as a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously  net earnings in decreased percent compared to in  net earnings increased percent compared to basic and diluted earnings per share increased percent and percent  respectively  in compared to  while basic and diluted earnings per share increased percent from the disproportionate change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of share repurchases 
non gaap operating performance measures we use non gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our non gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step up and other inventory charges  special items  certain claims  goodwill impairment  and the taxes on those items in addition to certain other tax adjustments 
we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period to period comparisons of our ongoing operating results  it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items  and it provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items 
certain of these non gaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were  million in  compared to  million in the principal source of cash from operating activities in was net earnings 
non cash charges included in net earnings accounted for another million of operating cash 
all other items of operating cash flows in were outflows of million of cash 
the lower cash flows provided by operating activities in were primarily due to increased investments in inventory to support significant new product launches and increased product liability payments 
we paid approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to durom cup product liability claims 
we estimate the net remaining liability after insurance recovery for durom cup claims as of december   is million 
we expect to pay the majority of this amount over the next five years 

table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report at december   we had days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable  which was the same as december  at december   we had days of inventory on hand  an increase of days compared to december  days of inventory on hand have increased due to significant new product launches 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million in additions to instruments and additions to other property  plant and equipment did not change significantly year over year 
in  instrument additions are expected to be in a range of to million and property  plant and equipment additions are expected to be in a range of to million 
we feel this level of capital spending is necessary to support new product related investments and replacement of older machinery and equipment 
we invest some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated debt securities 
the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities 
the timing of these investments can vary from year to year depending on the maturity of the debt securities and other cash and cash equivalent needs 
acquired intellectual property rights relate to lump sum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of prior contractual arrangements 
in the past three years  we have made various business acquisitions including dornoch medical systems  inc  synvasive technology  inc  extraortho  inc  beijing montagne medical device co  ltd  sodem diffusion sa and certain foreign based distributors 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for  compared to million in in  we returned cash to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends of million and share repurchases of million 
in as it relates to our senior credit facility  we converted some of the outstanding debt to a term loan and we borrowed million to repurchase shares as well as fund other corporate cash needs 
we plan to repay that million in the first quarter of in  we issued senior unsecured notes in public offerings and used some of the proceeds to repurchase shares 
in  we paid cash dividends quarterly  starting in april  at an annualized rate of per share 
we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis  however  future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change 
in december  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share that was paid in january we have four tranches of senior notes outstanding million aggregate principal amount of percent notes due november   million aggregate principal amount of percent notes due november   million aggregate principal amount of percent notes due november  and million aggregate principal amount of percent notes due november  interest on each series is payable on may and november of each year until maturity 
we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed  or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption  discounted to the date of redemption on a semi annual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debt agreement  plus basis points in the case of the notes  basis points in the case of the and notes  and basis points in the case of the notes 
we would also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date 
in may  we entered into a new five year  million revolving  multi currency  senior credit facility maturing may  the senior credit facility replaced a previous credit facility with similar terms that was due to mature on november  as of december   we had million outstanding under the senior credit facility and an availability of  million 
we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the senior credit facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a libor based rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the senior credit facility  at an alternate base rate  or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process 
the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement  including  among other things  limitations on consolidations  mergers and sales or transfers of assets 
financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of to if we fall below an investment grade credit rating  additional restrictions would result  including restrictions on investments  payment of dividends and stock repurchases 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december  commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees  including a facility and a utilization fee 
borrowings under the senior credit facility at december  are us dollar based 
borrowings of billion japanese yen outstanding under the previous credit facility were converted to the senior credit facility 
on may   we refinanced these borrowings by entering into a separate term loan agreement with one of the lenders under the senior credit facility for billion japanese yen and we repaid the outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility 
the term loan will mature on may  borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a fixed rate of percent per annum until maturity 
we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling million 
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we invest only in high quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 

table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report as of december   we had short term and long term investments in debt securities with a fair value of million 
these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and therefore we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer 
all of these debt securities remain highly rated and we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low 
as of december    million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are held in jurisdictions outside of the us and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations 
repatriation of these assets to the us may have tax consequences 
million of this amount is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk 
the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate 
we may use excess cash to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program 
as of december    million remained authorized under a billion repurchase program  which will expire on december  management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs  as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 
should investment opportunities arise  we believe that our earnings  balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital  if necessary 
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments 
the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions contractual obligations total and and and thereafter long term debt interest payments operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations million of the other long term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december   are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans 
defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans  they are not based upon future contributions 
due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance  changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions  we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond therefore  this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 
also included in other long term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon 
due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities  such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits  we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made 
therefore  this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these unrecognized tax benefits 
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r d milestones  sales milestones  or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product 
since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made  we have not included them in this table 
these payments could range from to million 
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
excess inventory and instruments we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost 
similarly  we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply 
accordingly  inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate net realizable value  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components 
the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in process inventory  which is recorded at cost 
obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off 
management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report benefits 
we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including existing tax laws  our experience with previous settlement agreements  the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
in addition to our general product liability  we have recorded provisions totaling million related to the durom cup  including million in see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets 
as such  these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs 
changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined our us spine reporting unit s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value 
fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches 
fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology  which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the us spine reporting unit of million in in  we also recorded an impairment charge related to this reporting unit of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment 
we have six other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them 
we estimated the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  or by doing a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the prior year s income approach 
for each of those six reporting units  the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value 
share based payment we measure share based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock 
additionally  we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock 
the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors 
the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management s best estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements to see how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars  korean won  swedish krona  czech koruna  thai baht  taiwan dollars  south african rand  russian rubles and indian rupees 
we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions 
these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 
for contracts outstanding at december   we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars  korean won  swedish krona  czech koruna  thai baht  taiwan dollars  south african rand  russian rubles and indian rupees and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january through june the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december  were  million 
the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december  were million 
the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december  were euro usd  swiss franc usd  usd japanese yen  british pound usd  usd canadian dollar  australian dollar usd  usd korean won  usd swedish krona  usd czech koruna  usd thai baht  usd taiwan dollar  usd south african rand  usd russian ruble and usd indian ruppee 
we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities 
our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december  indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the various currencies  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through june  depending on the direction of the change  by the following average approximate amounts in millions currency average amount euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged

form k annual report we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of  million at december   primarily in euros and japanese yen 
 million of the net asset exposure at december  relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
as a result  foreign currency remeasurement gains losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 
commodity price risk we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  polymer and sterile packaging 
we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of to months  where available  on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highly rated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits 
we also have short term and long term investments in highly rated corporate debt securities  us government and agency debt securities  us government treasury funds  municipal bonds  foreign government debt securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents 
presently  all of our debt outstanding under the senior credit facility bears interest at short term variable rates 
in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a consolidated notional amount of million that hedge a portion of our million percent senior notes due november  on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december   we receive a fixed interest rate of percent and we pay variable interest equal to the three month libor plus an average of basis points 
the interest rate swap agreements are to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
the objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents 
these derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under us gaap 
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  would not have a material effect on net interest expense 
this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  derivative instruments  counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 
we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions or highly rated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation 
we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines 
we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and  accordingly  are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems 
most notably  in europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government 
since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries  we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints 

table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report the ongoing financial crisis in the euro zone continues to impact the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals 
we have experienced an increasing number of days sales outstanding in some european countries compared to levels in as of december   in greece  italy  portugal and spain  countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk  our gross short term and long term trade accounts receivable combined were million 
with allowances for doubtful accounts of million recorded in those countries  the net balance was million  representing percent of our total consolidated short term and long term trade accounts receivable balance  net 
italy and spain account for million of that net amount 
we are actively monitoring the situations in these countries 
we maintain contact with these customers on a regular basis 
we continue to receive payments  albeit at a slower rate than in the past 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate in these countries  as ultimately we believe the governments in these countries will be able to pay 
as evidence of this  in spain we received significant payments in july  to settle certain past due accounts receivable 
to the extent these governments ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates  we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 
while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world  there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate
