litigation in january  borgwarner diversified transmission products inc dtp  a subsidiary of the company  filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court  southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile  aerospace  and agricultural implements workers of america uaw local no 
and gerald poor  individually and as the representative of a defendant class 
dtp sought the court affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor management relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april  and october   prior to the expiration of the then current collective bargaining agreements 
on september   the court found that dtp reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw  which did not expire until april  thus  the amendments were untimely 
in  the company recorded a charge of million as a result of the court decision 
dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court  southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 
and jim barrett and others  individually and as representatives of a defendant class  on february  again seeking the court affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april  certain retirees  on behalf of themselves and others  filed a mirror image action in the united states district court  eastern district of michigan southern division on march   for which a class has been certified

the company is vigorously defending against the suit 
this contingency is subject to many uncertainties  therefore based on the information available to date  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss  if any 
a decision on the merits of the suit could be rendered sometime in 
table of contents environmental the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and equivalent state laws and  as such  may presently be liable for the cost of clean up and other remedial activities at such sites 
responsibility for clean up and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
the company believes that none of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
generally  this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps  although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 
based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent public companies  will fully pay the cost apportioned to them  currently available information from prps and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs  and remediation alternatives  the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of million at december  the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years 
in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation  the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities  then unknown to the company  relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that pre date the company acquisition of kuhlman electric 
in and  lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others  including the company  on behalf of approximately plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs  mississippi plant 
the company entered into a settlement in july regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs and those of approximately  unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs attorneys 
in exchange for  among other things  the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants  the company agreed to pay up to million in settlement funds  which was expensed in the second quarter of the company paid million in november and made the final payment of million in february litigation concerning indemnification is pending and the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings 
product liability like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us  the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury actions 
we believe that the company involvement is limited because  in general  these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos 
the nature of the fibers  the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm 
as of both december  and december   the company had approximately  pending asbestos related product liability claims  respectively 
of the approximately  outstanding claims at december   approximately half were pending in jurisdictions that have undergone significant tort and judicial reform activities subsequent to the filing of these claims 

table of contents the company policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment 
the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos related product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers 
in  of the approximately  claims resolved  resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
in the full year of  of the approximately  claims resolved  resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
prior to june  the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the company primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements 
in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos related claims  the company has substantial excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos related product claims 
in june  primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits 
a declaratory judgment action was filed in january in the circuit court of cook county  illinois by continental casualty company and related companies against the company and certain of its historical general liability insurers 
the court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing 
the company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers  resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the company 
the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers 
on april   the superior court of new jersey appellate division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestos related action against the company and others 
the company filed its notice of petition to the supreme court of new jersey in late april  seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts 
on july   the supreme court of new jersey denied the company notice of petition appealing the decision of the lower courts 
the total claim of million was paid by the company in july although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels  due to the encapsulated nature of the products  the company experience in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past  and the company significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing  management does not believe that asbestos related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
to date  the company has paid and accrued million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received million in cash and notes from insurers 
the net balance of million  is expected to be fully recovered  of which approximately million is expected to be recovered within one year 
timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements 
at december   insurers owed million in association with these claims 
in addition to the million net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs  the company has estimated a liability of million for claims asserted  but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december  the company also has a related asset of million to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers  which is expected to be fully recovered 
receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above  which  more likely than not  will occur subsequent to december  at december   the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was million 

table of contents the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows december  millions of dollars assets prepayments and other current assets other non current assets total insurance assets liabilities accounts payable and accrued expenses other non current liabilities total accrued liabilities the increase in the accrued liability and associated insurance asset is primarily due to an expected higher rate of claim settlement based on recent litigation claim activity 
the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses  if any  in excess of those for which it has accrued  because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future  the allegations in such claims  the possible outcomes  or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company financial condition and results of operations 
some of these policies require management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes

these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes  as well as  the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  which is usually upon shipment of product 
although the company may enter into long term supply agreements with its major customers  each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements

table of contents impairment of long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  whether held for use or disposal  including other amortizing intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event 
if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment  management will perform a fair value analysis 
management determines fair value under asc topic using the appropriate valuation technique of market  income or cost approach 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable  however  changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations 
long lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long lived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review  ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset  and iii fair valuation of the asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year  the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units 
this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances  such as macro economic conditions  industry and market conditions  cost factors  relevant events and financial trends  that may impact a reporting unit fair value 
using this qualitative assessment  the company determines whether it is more likely than not the reporting unit fair value exceeds its carrying value 
if it is determined that it is not more likely than not the reporting unit fair value exceeds the carrying value  or upon a triggering event  including recent acquisition or divestiture activity  the company performs a quantitative  step one  goodwill impairment analysis 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit and determined it was more likely than not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units 
for the reporting unit with recent divestiture activity  the company performed a quantitative  step one  goodwill impairment analysis  which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates and growth rates 
the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the company annual budget and long range plan lrp 
the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance 
because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time  those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
further  the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the company facts and circumstances 
the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine its estimated fair value are reasonable 
different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value 
the primary assumptions affecting the company december  goodwill quantitative  step one  impairment review are as follows discount rate the company used a weighted average cost of capital wacc as the discount rate for future cash flows 
the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant 
operating income margin the company used historical and expected operating income margins  which may vary based on the projections the reporting unit being evaluated 

table of contents in addition to the above primary assumptions  the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model the automotive industry is cyclical and the company results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns 
the company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments 
the company is subject to risks related to international operations 
based on the assumptions outlined above  the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of indicated the company goodwill assigned to the reporting unit that was quantitatively assessed was not impaired 
additionally  a sensitivity analysis was completed indicating a increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of the reporting unit quantitatively assessed

product warranties the company provides warranties on some  but not all  of its products 
the warranty terms are typically from one to three years 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the accrual 
our warranty provision over the last three years  and as a percentage of net sales  has continued to decrease in conjunction with company improved quality efforts and has trended as follows year ended december  millions of dollars net sales warranty provision warranty provision as a percentage of net sales the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the company accrued warranty liability december  millions of dollars basis point decrease income expense basis point increase income expense at december   the total accrued warranty liability was million 
the accrual is represented as million in current liabilities and million in non current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranties 

table of contents other loss accruals and valuation allowances the company has numerous other loss exposures  such as customer claims  workers compensation claims  litigation and recoverability of assets 
establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization 
the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 
environmental contingencies the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites 
the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability 
we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined  in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range 
management estimate of the loss for environmental liability was million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 
pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees 
costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees  retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 
the company defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic the determination of the company obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement benefits  such as retiree health care  is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
certain assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rate  rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note  retirement benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods 
the primary assumptions affecting the company accounting for employee benefits under asc topics and as of december  are as follows expected long term rate of return on plan assets the expected long term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost 
the required use of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long term returns 
the expected long term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs  including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company trusts and its asset allocation  as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return  inflation and other variables 
the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans invested assets 
in determining its pension expense for the year ended december   the company used long term rates of return on plan assets ranging from to outside of the us and in the us 
table of contents actual returns on us pension assets were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  compared to the expected rate of return assumption of for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
actual returns on uk pension assets were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  compared to the expected rate of return assumption of for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
discount rate the discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations opeb 
the discount rate assumption is based on a constant effective yield from matching projected plan cash flows to high quality aa bond yields of corresponding maturities as of the measurement date 
the company used discount rates ranging from to to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december   including weighted average discount rates of in the us  outside of the us  and for us other postretirement health care plans 
the us discount rate reflects the fact that our us pension plan has been closed for new participants since for our us health care plan  and with the closing of our muncie facility in  there will be negligible service cost going forward 
health care cost trend for postretirement employee health care plan accounting  the company reviews external data and company specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions 
in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december   the company used health care cost trend rates of  declining to an ultimate trend rate of by the year while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and us pension plans on its pre tax pension expense millions of dollars impact on us pre tax pension expense income impact on non us pre tax pension expense income percentage point decrease in discount rate percentage point increase in discount rate percentage point decrease in expected return on assets percentage point increase in expected return on assets a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company s us pre tax pension expense

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 
since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to the company s valuation allowance may be necessary 
the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous non us jurisdictions

although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain  management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments  if any  which may be proposed by the taxing authorities 
at december   the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not loss on certain of its tax positions  which is included in other non current liabilities
