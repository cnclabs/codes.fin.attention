key business metrics we review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor our performance and trends affecting our businesses  and to develop forecasts and budgets 
these key measures include the following ftd segment metrics consumer orders 
we monitor the number of consumer orders for floral  gift and related products during a given period 
consumer orders are orders delivered during the period that originated in the us and canada  primarily from the www 
ftd 
com and www 
ftd 
ca websites and the send ftd telephone number  and in the uk and the republic of ireland  primarily from the www

com and www 
interflora 
ie websites and various telephone numbers 
the number of consumer orders is not adjusted for non delivered orders that are refunded on or after the scheduled delivery date 
orders originating with a florist or other retail location for delivery to consumers are not included 
the number of consumer orders received may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to seasonality resulting from the timing of key holidays  general economic conditions  fluctuations in marketing expenditures on initiatives designed to attract new and retain existing customers  changes in pricing for our floral  plant and gift products or competitive offerings  new or terminated partnerships  and changing consumer preferences  among other factors 

table of contents average order value 
we monitor the average value for consumer orders delivered in a given period  which we refer to as the average order value 
average order value represents the average us dollar amount received for consumer orders delivered during a period 
for orders placed outside the us principally in the us and the republic of ireland  this average us dollar amount is determined after translating the local currency amounts received into us dollars 
average order value includes merchandise revenues and shipping and service fees paid by the consumer  less discounts and refunds net of refund related fees charged to floral network members 
average order values may fluctuate from period to period based on the average foreign currency exchange rates  product mix  changes in merchandise pricing  shipping and service fees  levels of refunds issued  and discounts  among other factors 
content media and communications segment metrics pay accounts 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from our pay accounts and they represent one of the most important drivers of our business model 
a pay account is defined as a member who has paid for a subscription to a content media or communications service  and whose subscription has not terminated or expired 
a subscription provides the member with access to our service for a specific term for example  a month or a year and may be renewed upon the expiration of each term 
one time purchases of our services are not considered subscriptions and thus  are not included in the pay accounts metric 
a pay account does not equate to a unique subscriber since one subscriber could have several pay accounts 
in addition  at any point in time  our pay account base includes a number of accounts receiving a free period of service as either a promotion or retention tool  such as the subscribers receiving our free netzero g mobile broadband service  and a number of accounts that have notified us that they are terminating their service but whose service remains in effect 
in general  the key metrics that affect our revenues from our pay accounts base include the number of pay accounts and arpu 
a pay account generally becomes a free account following the expiration or termination of the related subscription 
arpu 
we monitor arpu  which is a monthly measure calculated by dividing services revenues generated from the pay accounts of our content media or communications segment  as applicable  for a period after translation into us dollars by the average number of segment pay accounts for that period  divided by the number of months in that period 
the average number of pay accounts is the simple average of the number of pay accounts at the beginning and the end of a period 
arpu may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the extent to which promotional  discounted or retention pricing is used to attract new  or retain existing  paying subscribers  changes in the mix of pay services and the related pricing plans  increases or decreases in the price of our services  the timing of pay accounts being added or removed during a period  and for the content media segment the average foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro 
churn 
to evaluate the retention characteristics of our membership base  we also monitor the percentage of pay accounts that terminate or expire  which we refer to as our average monthly churn rate 
our average monthly churn rate is calculated as the total number of pay accounts that terminated or expired in a period divided by the average number of pay accounts for that period  divided by the number of months in that period 
our average monthly churn percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to our mix of subscription terms  which affects the timing of subscription expirations  and other factors 
we make certain normalizing adjustments to the calculation of our churn percentage for periods in which we add a significant number of pay accounts due to acquisitions 
for our communications segment pay accounts  we do not include in our churn calculation dial up accounts canceled during the first days of service unless the accounts have upgraded from free accounts  although a number of such accounts will be included in our account totals at any given measurement date 
additionally  we do not include netzero g mobile broadband service accounts canceled during 
table of contents the first days of service provided the mobile broadband service device is returned within days of cancelation 
subscribers who cancel one pay service but subscribe to another pay service are not necessarily considered to have canceled a pay account depending on the services and  as such  our segment churn rates are not necessarily indicative of the percentage of subscribers canceling any particular service 
active accounts 
we monitor the number of active accounts among our membership base 
content media segment active accounts are defined as the sum of all pay accounts as of the date presented  the monthly average for the period of all free accounts who have visited our domestic or international online nostalgia websites excluding schoolfeed and the names database at least once during the period  and the monthly average for the period of all online loyalty marketing members who have earned or redeemed points during such period 
communications segment active accounts include all communications segment pay accounts as of the date presented combined with the number of free dial up internet access and email accounts that logged on to our services at least once during the preceding days 
content media segment and communications segment active accounts for the six month  nine month and annual periods  as applicable  are calculated as a simple average of the quarterly active accounts for each respective segment 
in general  we count and track pay accounts and free accounts by unique member identifiers 
users have the ability to register for separate services under separate brands and member identifiers independently 
we do not track whether a pay account has purchased more than one of our services unless the account uses the same member identifier 
as a result  total active accounts may not represent total unique users 
the table below sets forth  for the periods presented  as applicable  our consolidated revenues  segment revenues  consumer orders  average order value  average currency exchange rates  pay accounts  segment churn  arpu  and segment active accounts 
revenues and operating results from the ftd segment are impacted by seasonal holiday timing variations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as such  we believe that comparisons of the ftd segment revenues and operating results for any period with those of the immediately preceding period or  in some instances  the same period of the preceding fiscal year  may be of limited relevance in evaluating its historical financial performance and predicting its future financial performance 
the pay accounts and arpu metrics for the content media segment may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to various factors including  but not limited to  the extent to which discounted pricing is offered in prior and current periods  the percentage of pay accounts being

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following accounting policies  estimates and assumptions made by management thereunder are the most 
table of contents critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these estimates and assumptions require management most difficult  subjective or complex judgment and may be based on matters  the effects of which are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we apply the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
asc outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  no significant company obligations remain  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues exclude sales taxes collected 
ftd segment revenue recognition products revenues and the related cost of revenues are recognized when products are delivered to the customers  less discounts and refunds 
shipping and service fees charged to customers are recognized at the time the related products revenues are recognized and are included in products revenues 
shipping and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues 
ftd consumer businesses generally recognize revenues on a gross basis because ftd bears the risks and rewards associated with the revenue generating activities by i acting as a principal in the transaction  ii establishing prices  iii being responsible for fulfillment of the order by the floral network members and third party suppliers  iv taking the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and v marketing the products and services 
ftd also sells point of sale systems and related technology services to its floral network members and recognizes revenue in accordance with asc and asc  software 
ftd recognizes revenue on hardware which is sold without software at the time of delivery 
for hardware sales that include software  revenue is recognized when delivery  installation and customer acceptance have all occurred 
services revenues based on orders sent to floral network members are recognized in the period in which the orders are delivered 
monthly fees  recurring fees and other floral network service based fees are recognized in the period in which the related service is provided 
content media segment and communications segment revenue recognition revenues are comprised of product revenues  which are derived primarily from the sale of yearbook reprints and related shipping fees  as well as from the sale of third party merchandise  services revenues  which are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts  and advertising and other revenues 
our online nostalgia products revenues are derived from the sale of yearbook reprints and related shipping fees 
products revenues from the sale of yearbook reprints are recognized upon delivery to the customer 
shipping fees charged to customers are recognized at the time the related products revenues are recognized and are included in products revenues 
shipping costs are included in cost of revenues 
our communications products revenues are generated from the sale of netzero g mobile broadband service devices and the related shipping and handling fees and are recognized upon delivery of such devices 
sales of netzero g mobile broadband service devices bundled with free or paid service plans are allocated using the relative selling price method in accordance with the multiple element arrangement provisions of asc the selling prices of our netzero g mobile broadband paid service plans are determined by vendor specific objective evidence  which is based upon the monthly stand alone selling price of each plan 
the selling prices of the netzero g mobile broadband service devices and free service plans are determined by management best estimate of selling price  which considers market and economic conditions  internal costs  pricing  and discounting practices 
the revenues allocated to the free or paid service plans are recognized ratably over the service period 

table of contents service revenues for our online nostalgia services and for our communications services are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts and are recognized in the period in which fees are fixed or determinable and the related services are provided to the customer 
our pay accounts generally pay in advance for their services by credit card  paypal or check  and revenues are then recognized ratably over the service period 
advance payments from pay accounts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue 
we offer alternative payment methods to credit cards for certain communications pay service plans 
these alternative payment methods currently include use of automated clearinghouse  payment by money order  or payment through a local telephone company 
in circumstances where payment is not received in advance  revenues are only recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured 
advertising revenues from our online nostalgia services and from our communications services consist primarily of amounts from our internet search partner that are generated as a result of users utilizing the partner internet search services  amounts generated from display advertisements  and amounts generated from referring members to third party websites or services 
we recognize such advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed or  for performance based arrangements  when the related performance criteria are met 
in determining whether an arrangement exists  we ensure that a written contract is in place  such as a standard insertion order or a customer specific agreement 
we assess whether performance criteria have been met and whether the fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and the payment terms associated with the transaction 
the reconciliation of the performance criteria generally includes a comparison of our internally tracked performance data to the contractual performance obligation and  when available  to third party or customer provided performance data 
advertising and other revenues for our online loyalty marketing service consist primarily of fees generated when emails are transmitted to members  when members respond to emails and when members complete online transactions 
each of these activities is a discrete  independent activity  which generally is specified in the agreement with each advertising customer 
as the earning activities take place  activity measurement data examples include the number of emails delivered and the number of responses received is accumulated and the related revenues are recorded 
our online loyalty marketing service also generates revenues from the sale of gift cards 
probability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if it is determined that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is not recognized until collectibility becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management estimate of their fair values 
we account for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which among other things  addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
asc prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and requires us to test goodwill  at the reporting unit level  and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually 
we test the goodwill of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an 
table of contents adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key management or other personnel  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the acquired business or our overall business  significant and sustained decline in market capitalization  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations 
the determination of whether or not goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units 
the determination of the fair values of our reporting units generally includes a study of market comparables  including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
goodwill we operate in three reportable segments  in accordance with asc  segment reporting  and we have identified five reporting units ftd  interflora  classmates  mypoints  and communications for purposes of evaluating goodwill 
these reporting units each constitute a business or group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management 
the goodwill related to our acquired businesses is specific to each reporting unit and the goodwill amounts are assigned as such 
testing goodwill for impairment involves a two step quantitative process 
however  prior to performing the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test for selected reporting units 
if we choose that option  we are not required to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test unless we have determined  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the two step quantitative impairment test is required or chosen  the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  including goodwill  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
if  however  the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill  then the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared with its implied fair value 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
annual goodwill impairment assessment we performed the annual quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test resulted in the determination that the fair values of ftd  interflora  classmates  and communications exceeded their carrying amounts  including goodwill 
accordingly  the second step was not required for these reporting units 
the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying amount for the communications reporting unit 
the determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
we believe our analysis included sufficient tolerance for sensitivity in key assumptions 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units included a study of market comparables  including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections 
we believe the assumptions and rates used in our impairment 
table of contents assessment are reasonable  but they are judgmental  and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and  if applicable  the impairment amount 
the fair value of the interflora reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 
the amount of goodwill assigned to the interflora reporting unit at october  was million 
the inputs for the fair value calculation of the reporting unit included a growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 
in addition  we assumed revenue growth and applied margin and other cost assumptions consistent with the reporting unit historical trends 
factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the interflora reporting unit include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in i forecasted sales volumes and average order values  which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand  including macroeconomic factors  competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences  ii marketing costs to generate orders  iii product costs  and iv equity valuations of peer companies 
an increase of basis points in the discount rate for the interflora reporting unit would have resulted in a decrease in the income approach valuation of the reporting unit of million 
a decrease of basis points in the terminal growth rate would have resulted in a decrease in the income approach valuation of the interflora reporting unit of million 
given the weighting of to the income approach for the interflora reporting unit  a basis point increase in the discount rate would have caused the interflora reporting unit to fail the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
however  a basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would not have caused the interflora reporting unit to fail the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the fair value of the ftd reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 
the amount of goodwill assigned to the ftd reporting unit at october  was million 
the inputs for the fair value calculation of the reporting unit at october  included a growth rate to calculate terminal value and a discount rate of 
in addition  we assumed revenue growth and applied margin and other cost assumptions consistent with the reporting unit historical trends 
factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the ftd reporting unit include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in i forecasted sales volumes and average order values  which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand  including macroeconomic factors  competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences  ii marketing costs to generate orders  iii product costs  and iv equity valuations of peer companies 
an increase of basis points in the discount rate for the ftd reporting unit would have resulted in a decrease in the income approach valuation of the reporting unit of million 
a decrease of basis points in the terminal growth rate would have resulted in a decrease in the income approach valuation of the ftd reporting unit of million 
given the weighting of to the income approach for the ftd reporting unit  a basis point increase in the discount rate would have caused the ftd reporting unit to fail the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
however  a basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would not have caused the ftd reporting unit to fail the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the fair value of the classmates reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 
the amount of goodwill assigned to the classmates reporting unit at october  was million 
the inputs for the fair value calculations of the reporting unit included a growth rate to calculate the terminal value and a discount rate of 
in addition  we assumed revenue growth and applied margin and other cost assumptions consistent with the reporting unit historical trends 
factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the classmates reporting unit include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in i number of pay accounts  active accounts and arpu  which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand  including macroeconomic factors  competitive dynamics and changes in consumer preferences  ii marketing costs to generate new pay accounts  and iii equity valuations of peer companies 
an increase of basis points in the discount rate for the classmates reporting unit would have resulted in a decrease in the income approach valuation of the classmates reporting unit of million 
a decrease of basis 
table of contents points in the terminal growth rate would have resulted in a decrease in the income approach valuation of the classmates reporting unit of million 
neither a basis point increase in the discount rate nor a basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would have caused the classmates reporting unit to fail the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
impairment of goodwill the mypoints reporting unit generates higher revenues and operating income in the quarter ending december when compared to the other quarters 
in the quarter ended december  revenues and operating income were substantially lower than expected 
the company lowered its forecast for future periods  which resulted in the determination that the estimated fair value of the mypoints reporting unit was less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
accordingly  the second step was performed 
based on the results of the second step  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge totaling million 
the impairment charge was included in impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
indefinite lived intangible assets testing indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment requires a one step approach under asc we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently  if events occur or circumstances change that indicate they may be impaired 
the fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are compared to their respective carrying amounts and if the carrying amount of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess 
the process of estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is subjective and requires us to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses 
such estimates include  but are not limited to  future operating performance and cash flows  royalty rate  terminal growth rate  and discount rate 
we did not record any impairment charges related to our indefinite lived intangible assets in the year ended december  finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets we account for identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposition of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recorded at management estimate of their fair values 
we evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets  other than indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  shifts in technology  loss of key management or other personnel  significant negative industry or economic trends  changes in our operating model or strategy  and competitive forces 
in determining if an impairment exists  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
if an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying amounts and the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the respective fair values of the assets 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line basis or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from two to ten years 
our identifiable intangible assets were acquired primarily in connection with business combinations 

table of contents the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as  but not limited to  the asset group to be tested for recoverability 
we are also required to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analyses 
such estimates include  but are not limited to  future operating performance and cash flows  cost of capital  terminal values  and remaining economic lives of assets 
impairment of intangible assets as a result of the lower than expected fourth quarter revenues and operating income within the mypoints reporting unit  we performed an impairment test of the assets within this reporting unit and recorded an impairment charge totaling million related to certain trademarks 
this impairment charge was included in impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
member redemption liability member redemption liability for online loyalty marketing service points represents the estimated costs associated with the obligation of mypoints to redeem outstanding points accumulated by its online loyalty marketing service members  as well as those points purchased by its advertisers for use in such advertisers promotional campaigns  less an allowance for points expected to expire prior to redemption 
the estimated cost of points is primarily presented in cost of revenues  except for the portion related to member acquisition activities  internal marketing surveys and other non revenue generating activities  which are presented in sales and marketing expenses 
the member redemption liability is recognized when members earn points  less an allowance for points expected to expire  and is reduced when members redeem accumulated points upon reaching required redemption thresholds or when points expire prior to redemption 
mypoints members may redeem points for third party gift cards and other rewards 
members earn points when they respond to direct marketing offers delivered by mypoints  purchase goods or services from advertisers  engage in certain promotional campaigns of advertisers  or engage in other specified activities 
the member redemption liability is estimated based upon the weighted average cost and number of points that may be redeemed in the future 
the weighted average cost of points is calculated by taking the total cost of items fulfilled divided by total points redeemed 
mypoints purchases gift cards and other awards from merchants at a discount and sets redemption levels for its members 
the discounts and points needed to redeem awards vary by merchant and award denomination 
mypoints has the ability to adjust the number of points required to redeem awards to reflect changes in the cost of awards 
mypoints accounts for and reduces the gross points issued by an estimate of points that will never be redeemed by its members 
this reduction is calculated based on an analysis of historical point earning trends  redemption activities and individual member account activity 
mypoints historical analysis takes into consideration the total points in members accounts that have been inactive for six months or longer  less an estimated reactivation rate  plus an estimate for future cancelations of points that have not yet been outstanding for days 
changes in  among other factors  the net number of points issued  redemption activities and members activity levels could materially impact the member redemption liability 
a basis point increase or decrease in the estimate of points that will never be redeemed would increase or decrease our member redemption liability at december  by approximately  points in active mypoints accounts do not expire  however  unredeemed points expire after twelve consecutive months of inactivity 
for purposes of the member redemption liability  inactive means a lack of all of the following email response  survey completion  profile update  and any point earning or 
table of contents point redeeming transaction 
the canceling or disabling of inactive mypoints accounts would have no impact on our consolidated financial statements  as we fully consider inactive mypoints accounts when establishing the member redemption liability  as discussed above 
the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  a reconciliation of the changes in the member redemption liability in thousands year ended december  beginning balance accruals for points earned reduction for redeemed points changes in allowance for points expected to expire and weighted average cost of points ending balance income taxes we apply the provisions of asc  income taxes 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in accordance with asc  we recognize  in our consolidated financial statements  the impact of our tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions 
the company recognizes interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and investigations 
we record liabilities related to pending matters when an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable and management can reasonably estimate the amount or range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  we continually assess the potential liability related to such pending matters

on june   ftd group  inc repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement 
no penalties were paid in connection with such repayment 
the repayment of obligations under the credit agreement was financed with the proceeds of the million of term loan borrowings under the credit agreement and ftd available cash 
no funds were borrowed under the revolving credit facility at closing or through december  
table of contents the obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by ftd parent  unol intermediate  inc holdings  and certain of the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of ftd group  inc the subsidiary guarantors 
in addition  the obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of ftd group  inc  holdings and the subsidiary guarantors collectively  the loan parties  including a pledge of all except with respect to foreign subsidiaries  in which case such pledges are limited to of the outstanding capital stock of certain direct subsidiaries of the loan parties 
the interest rates on both the term loan and the revolving credit facility are either a base rate plus per annum  or libor plus per annum with a libor floor of in the case of the term loan and step downs in the libor margin on the revolving credit facility depending on ftd net leverage ratio 
in addition  there is a commitment fee  which is currently equal to per annum with additional step downs in the commitment fee depending on ftd net leverage ratio  on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  events of default  affirmative covenants  and negative covenants  that require  among other things  ftd to maintain compliance with a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and impose restrictions and limitations on  among other things  capital expenditures  investments  dividends  asset sales  and incurrence of additional debt or liens by holdings  ftd group  inc and their subsidiaries 
the credit agreement also provides for an additional million in borrowing  subject to certain conditions  including compliance with covenants and approval by the lender group 
our total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  our summary cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital  including  but not limited to  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  loss on extinguishment of debt  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  and deferred taxes 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a million decrease in net income 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in non cash items  which consisted of a million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge  an million decrease in deferred taxes  a million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the refinancing of the credit agreement in june and  to a lesser extent  lower stock based compensation 
additionally  net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by a million favorable change in working capital 
changes in working capital can cause variation in our cash flows provided by operating activities due to seasonality  timing and other factors 
net cash used for investing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million of cash paid for the acquisitions of schoolfeed  inc and the gifts division of flying brands limited during the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in cash paid for purchases of property and equipment and a million decrease 
table of contents in cash paid for purchases of rights  content and intellectual property related to our online nostalgia services 
in april  we completed the acquisition of the gifts division of flying brands limited and paid million in cash upon closing 
in june  we completed the acquisition of schoolfeed for million in cash upon closing and a maximum of million of contingent consideration payments payable upon the achievement of certain performance objectives 
the contingent consideration will be measured based on three annual earnout periods ending june   and and will be paid out on an annual basis shortly after the closing of each annual earnout period 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  totaled million 
at december   we had million of property and equipment that was not yet paid for and was included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for will be in the range of million to million  which includes the aforementioned million of purchases on account at december  the actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  potential future acquisitions and new business initiatives  which are difficult to predict and which could change significantly over time 
additionally  technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment 
net cash used for financing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  in june  we refinanced the credit agreement and  in connection with the refinancing  we received net proceeds of million  which along with ftd available cash  were used to repay the outstanding balance on the credit agreement of million 
in the year ended december   we repaid million on the outstanding credit agreement 
in addition  repurchases of common stock for the year ended december  decreased by million  compared to the year ended december  the payment of dividends and dividend equivalents is a cash outflow from financing activities 
in january  april  august  and october  united online  inc board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividends were paid on february   may   august   and november  and totaled million  million  million  and million  respectively  including dividend equivalents paid on nonvested restricted stock units 
in january  united online  inc board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
the record date for the dividend was february  and the dividend  which totaled million  including dividend equivalents paid on nonvested restricted stock units  was paid on february  the payment of future dividends is discretionary and is subject to determination by united online  inc board of directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance and other factors 
future cash flows from financing activities may also be affected by our repurchases of our common stock 
united online  inc board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program the program that allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions based on prevailing market conditions and other factors 
from august through december   we repurchased a total of million of our common stock under the program  leaving million of authorization remaining under the program 
in february  the board of directors extended the program through december  and authorized an increase in the million authorization remaining to million 
in december  the board of directors extended the program through december  in january  the board of directors approved and ratified the extension of the program through december  we did not make any repurchases under the program during the year ended december  and  at december   the authorization remaining under the program was million 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities may also be negatively impacted by the withholding of a portion of shares underlying the restricted stock units and stock awards we grant to employees 
in general  we currently do not collect the applicable required employee withholding taxes from employees upon vesting of restricted stock units and upon the issuance of stock awards 
instead  we automatically withhold  from the restricted stock units that vest and the stock awards that are issued  the portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the required employee withholding taxes due 
we then pay the applicable withholding taxes in cash 
the withholding of these shares  although accounted for as a common stock repurchase  does not reduce the amount available under the program 
similar to repurchases of common stock under the program  the net effect of such withholding will adversely impact our cash flows from financing activities 
the amounts remitted in the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively  for which we withheld million and million shares of common stock  respectively  that were underlying the restricted stock units which vested 
the amount we pay in future periods will vary based on our stock price and the number of applicable restricted stock units vesting and stock awards being issued during the period 
based on our current projections  we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations  at least for the next twelve months 
if we complete the ftd spin off transaction  we will be a substantially smaller company than we were prior to the ftd spin off transaction  and we anticipate that our consolidated cash flows will be substantially smaller when compared to periods prior to the ftd spin off transaction 
we may use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund  among other things  both contractual payments and optional prepayments on the outstanding balance under the credit agreement  dividend payments  if declared by united online  inc board of directors  the development and or acquisition of other services  businesses or technologies  the repurchase of our common stock underlying restricted stock units and stock awards to pay the required employee withholding taxes due on vested restricted stock units and stock awards issued  the repurchase of our common stock under the program  future capital expenditures  and future acquisitions of intangible assets  including rights  content and intellectual property 
under the terms of the credit agreement  ftd group  inc  a subsidiary of united online  inc  is generally restricted from transferring funds and other assets to united online  inc  with certain exceptions including an annual basket of million subject to adjustment based on excess cash flow calculations which may be used to make cash dividends  loans and advances to united online  inc  provided certain terms and conditions specified in the credit agreement are satisfied 
these restrictions have resulted in restricted net assets as defined in rule e of regulation s x of ftd group  inc and its subsidiaries totaling million  including cash of million  at december  in may  ftd group  inc made a voluntary debt prepayment of million on the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement  which has eliminated all future scheduled mandatory principal payments 
the credit agreement also includes provisions which require us to make debt prepayments in the event that we generate consolidated excess cash flow and the net leverage ratio is higher than a threshold level  as defined in the credit agreement  on an annual basis commencing in april for fiscal year the excess cash flow payment due in april is million 
the degree to which our assets are leveraged and the terms of our debt could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital  as well as the terms at which such capital might be offered to us 
we currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to fulfill our debt service obligations  at least in the next twelve months 
ftd group  inc was in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement at december  if we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements  this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could severely constrain or prevent us from  among other factors  developing new or enhancing existing services or products

if additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage of stock owned by the then current stockholders could be reduced 
furthermore  such equity or any debt securities that we issue might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to holders of our common stock 
in addition  trends in the securities and credit markets may restrict our ability to raise any such additional funds  at least in the near term 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital including  but not limited to  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  loss on extinguishment of debt  deferred taxes  and tax benefits shortfalls from equity awards 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due to a million increase in working capital requirements primarily related to a decline in deferred revenue primarily as a result of a decline in content media pay accounts and  to a lesser extent  the timing of payments to vendors and changes in tax liabilities  as well as a million decrease in net income  adjusted for non cash items 
changes in working capital can cause variation in our cash flows provided by operating activities due to seasonality  timing and other factors 
net cash used for investing activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in cash paid for purchases of property and equipment and a million decrease in cash paid for purchases of rights  content and intellectual property related to our online nostalgia services business 
net cash used for financing activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  in the year ended december   we refinanced the credit agreement and  in connection with the refinancing  we received net proceeds of million  which  along with ftd available cash  were used to repay the outstanding balance on the credit agreement of million 
in the year ended december   we repaid million on the outstanding balance of the credit agreement and million on the uol credit agreement 
additionally  repurchases of common stock for the year ended december  decreased by million  compared to the year ended december  fair value measurements we measure our contingent consideration liability at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
at december   the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the schoolfeed acquisition was estimated at million  which is approximately of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a monte carlo simulation based on estimated probabilities of us and other target market daily registrations  mean growth rates to for us registrations and to for other target market registrations  each with a standard deviation of  during the three annual earnout periods ending june   and  an estimated rate of conversion of new subscribers to pay accounts  and a discount rate of 
we recognized a gain of million in the year ended december  related to changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration 
changes to one or multiple inputs to the monte carlo simulation  including the discount rate  growth rates  volatility rates  the estimated number of 
table of contents daily registrations  and the estimated rate of conversion of new subscribers to pay accounts  could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration 
we review and reassess the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on a quarterly basis  and future fair value estimates could differ from the initial estimate 
contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  were as follows in thousands total less than year year to less than years years to less than years more than years debt  including interest member redemption liability noncancelable operating leases contingent consideration purchase obligations other liabilities total at december   we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling million  of which million was included in other liabilities in the contractual obligations table above and  at december   was expected to be due in less than one year 
we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments for long term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions will occur 
commitments under letters of credit at december  were scheduled to expire as follows in thousands total less than year year to less than years year to less than years more than years letters of credit letters of credit are maintained pursuant to certain of our lease arrangements 
the letters of credit remain in effect at declining levels through the terms of the related leases 
standby letters of credit are maintained by ftd to secure credit card processing activity and additional letters of credit are maintained related to inventory purchases

in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers and employees that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors  officers or employees 
we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers  directors and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities  including those arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and certain of our officers and employees  and former officers  directors and employees of acquired companies  in certain circumstances

recent accounting pronouncements testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  as codified in asc the amendments in this update allow an entity to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  thus necessitating that it perform the quantitative impairment test 
an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
an entity choosing to perform the qualitative assessment would need to identify and consider those events and circumstances that  individually or in the aggregate  most significantly affect an indefinite lived intangible asset fair value 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim impairment tests of indefinite lived intangible assets performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
we perform our annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter and adopted this update in the quarter ended december  the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  as codified in asc the amendments in this update require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risk associated with interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our cash and cash equivalents and the outstanding balance of the credit agreement 
the interest rate set forth in the credit agreement for the term loan and the revolving credit facility is either a base rate plus per annum  or libor plus per annum with a libor floor of in the case of the term loan 
in march  ftd group  inc entered into forward starting interest rate cap instruments based on month libor that are effective from january to june and have aggregated notional values totaling million 
the interest rate cap instruments are designated as cash flow hedges against expected future cash flows attributable to future month libor interest payments on the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
the gains or losses on the instruments are reported in other comprehensive income to the extent that they are effective and will be reclassified into earnings when the expected future cash flows  beginning in january through june and attributable to future month libor interest payments  are recognized in earnings 
a basis point increase in libor rates would result in an estimated annual increase in our interest expense related to the outstanding debt under the credit agreement of approximately million 
while we do not currently maintain any short term investments  we still maintain deposits  which are classified as cash equivalents 
therefore  our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us and certain foreign interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in foreign currencies  and we are exposed to risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound gbp  the euro eur and the indian rupee inr and  to a much lesser extent  the swedish krona sek  the swiss franc chf and the canadian dollar cad  which may result in gains or losses reported in our results of operations 
the volatilities in gbp  eur  inr  sek  chf  and cad and all other applicable foreign currencies are monitored by us throughout the year 
we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange rates translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
substantially all of the revenues of our foreign subsidiaries are received  and substantially all expenses are incurred  in currencies other than the us dollar  which increases or decreases the related us dollar reported revenues and expenses depending on the exchange rate trend in currencies 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and net income 
a adverse change in overall foreign currency exchange rates over an entire year would not have a material impact on estimated annual revenues or estimated annual income before income taxes 
these estimates assume an adverse shift in all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  which do not always move in the same direction or in the same degrees  and actual results may differ materially 
net foreign currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency are included in other income  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
we currently utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to protect the value of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and certain forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies 
table of contents other than the us dollar 
these contracts are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign entities and hedges of cash flows 
at december   the notional value of open forward foreign currency exchange contracts accounted for as net investment and cash flow hedges totaled million and million  respectively 
periodically  we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes 
we enter into these derivative instruments to hedge intercompany transactions and partially offset the economic effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   the notional value of open forward foreign currency exchange contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment totaled million 
we may  in the future  also use other derivative financial instruments  if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk
