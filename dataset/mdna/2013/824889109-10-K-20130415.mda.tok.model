executive summary fiscal we continued to execute on two strategic initiatives during fiscal  which included capitalizing on the fashion driving consumer footwear demand and aggressively opening stores in new and existing markets 
unseasonably warm weather patterns early in our first quarter of fiscal served as a catalyst for early sales of sandalized footwear and athletic shoes for all ages 
coupling this with the traditional period for our customer to receive their income tax refund proved instrumental in driving strong comparable store sales growth for february and provided momentum to drive athletic business throughout the first quarter 
as we progressed through spring and into the back to school season  sales and earnings continued to be strong  with sales gains on a comparable store basis being driven by an increase in the average selling price of our footwear 
consumer demand began to temper early in the fourth quarter as our moderate income customer was impacted by the rising economic uncertainties and unfavorable weather patterns for the purchase of seasonal footwear 
during fiscal  we opened new stores  including stores in the dallas fort worth metroplex and puerto rico  which were new major markets for us 
pre opening expenses  including distribution  occupancy and selling expenses  were million for fiscal  a million increase over fiscal during which we opened new stores 
despite the challenges presented by the changes in consumer demand late in fiscal and a significant increase in new store openings  we were able to manage our inventories and control our costs such that operating income  as a percentage of sales  improved by to for fiscal  as compared to the prior year 
we achieved record earnings per diluted share of in fiscal  representing a increase over earnings per diluted share of achieved in fiscal fiscal was also a period of senior leadership transition for us 
mark lemond retired at the end of october after serving as our president and chief executive officer for the last years 
cliff sifford  who was then serving as our executive vice president general merchandise manager  was appointed as president  chief executive officer and chief merchandising officer 
additionally for fiscal net sales increased over fiscal to million 
similar to other retailers  we follow the retail reporting calendar  which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal the rd week 
our sales for the rd week approximated million 
comparable store sales  which were reported on a week comparable sales basis  increased 
inventories at february  increased million compared to the end of the prior year 
approximately one half of this increase was attributable to our net store growth with the remaining increase primarily due to increases in the average cost of footwear 
during the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a three for two stock split of the shares of our common stock  which was effected in the form of a stock dividend on april  upon the completion of the stock split  our outstanding shares increased from approximately million shares to approximately million shares 
our board of directors approved the payment of our first ever quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders during the second quarter of fiscal the initial dividend was followed by the approval and payment of two additional quarterly dividends during fiscal  each in the amount of per share 
additionally  our board of directors approved the payment of a special cash dividend of per share during december in total during fiscal  we returned million to our shareholders through our quarterly and special cash dividends 
during fiscal  we returned additional capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of approximately  shares of our common stock at an average price of  or an aggregate cost of million 
fiscal in fiscal  we remain focused on growing our business both through store expansion and enhancing the shoe carnival brand 
we expect to open between to new stores and close five to seven stores 
the majority of our new store locations will serve to fill in certain under penetrated markets with additional stores  thereby increasing the performance of the overall market 
the balance of our new store openings will be in new smaller markets that we can fully penetrate with one or two stores 
our fiscal plans also call for continued reinvestment in our existing brick and mortar store base  focusing on in store graphics  including signage updates to focal walls and end caps 
dependent upon successful lease negotiations  we plan to remodel approximately stores 
in the second half of fiscal  we will begin testing the addition of certain women s non athletic better brands in approximately of our stores 
our consumer research indicates that this customer is coming into our store and purchasing footwear for her husband and children  but purchasing this better product elsewhere 
our goal is to capture this customer by filling this product void 
we are also introducing a new television campaign in fiscal  which is designed to better communicate to our customers  especially in new markets  what makes shopping at shoe carnival a unique and differentiated shopping experience 
while this television campaign is expected to help us attract new customers  we believe it will also keep the attention of our existing customers 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgments in our reported financial results 
these judgments involve estimates based in part on our historical experience and incorporate the impact of the current general economic climate and company specific circumstances 
however  because future events and economic conditions are inherently uncertain  our actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgments are included below 
merchandise inventories our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm as of the balance sheet date and consist primarily of dress  casual and athletic footwear for men  women and children 
the cost of our merchandise is determined using the first in  first out valuation method fifo 
for determining market value  we estimate the future demand and related sale price of merchandise in our inventory 
the stated value of merchandise inventories contained on our consolidated balance sheets also includes freight  certain capitalized overhead costs and reserves 
we review our inventory at the end of each quarter to determine if it is properly stated at lcm 
factors considered include  among others  recent sale prices  the length of time merchandise has been held in inventory  quantities of the various styles held in inventory  seasonality of the merchandise  expected consideration to be received from our vendors and current and expected future sales trends 
we reduce the value of our inventory to its estimated net realizable value where cost exceeds the estimated future selling price 
merchandise inventories as of february  totaled million  representing approximately of total assets 
merchandise inventories as of january  totaled million  representing approximately of total assets 
given the significance of inventories to our consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable value is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
material changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the actual net realizable value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment subject to depreciation  are evaluated for impairment on a periodic basis if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this evaluation includes performing an analysis of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets 
assets are grouped and the evaluation performed at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  which is generally at a store level 
if the estimated future cash flows for a store are determined to be less than the carrying value of the store s assets  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our long lived assets using store specific cash flow assumptions discounted by a rate commensurate with the risk involved with such assets while incorporating marketplace assumptions 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgment 
assets subject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and  if applicable  an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our long lived assets as of february  totaled million  or of total assets  and as of january  totaled million  or of total assets 
our evaluations performed during fiscal and fiscal resulted in non cash impairment charges of  and  respectively 
if actual operating results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  the carrying value of certain of our assets may prove unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
insurance reserves we self insure a significant portion of our workers compensation  general liability and employee health care costs and also maintain insurance in each area of risk protecting us from individual and aggregate losses over specified dollar values 
we review the liability reserved for our self insured portions on a quarterly basis  taking into consideration a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  statistical trends and  in certain instances  valuation assistance provided by independent third parties 
our self insurance reserves include estimates of both claims filed  carried at their expected ultimate settlement value  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
as of february  and january   our self insurance reserves totaled million and million  respectively 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimating process 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to future losses or gains that could be material 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our current and future income taxes for each tax jurisdiction in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and evaluating our tax positions 
as a part of this process deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
our temporary timing differences relate primarily to inventory  depreciation  accrued expenses  deferred lease incentives and stock based compensation 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates enacted and expected to be in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we are also required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures and account for uncertain tax positions associated with our income tax filings 
we must presume that taxing authorities will examine all uncertain tax positions and that they have full knowledge of all relevant information 
however  interpretations of guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations are often complex  ambiguous and frequently change over time and a number of years may elapse before a particular issue is resolved 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions  tax authorities could assess tax liabilities greater or less than our accrued positions for open tax periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution  and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income in the regular course of business  we offer our customers sales incentives including coupons  discounts  and free merchandise 
sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances 
if an incentive involves free merchandise  that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost of sales 
comparable store sales for the periods indicated below include stores that have been open for full months prior to the beginning of the period  including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled 
therefore  stores opened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparable store sales nor are our e commerce sales 
our e commerce sales were included in comparable sales starting with the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to net sales net sales increased million to million for fiscal  a increase over net sales for fiscal similar to other retailers  we follow the retail reporting calendar  which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal the rd week 
net sales of approximately million were recorded for this extra week 
of our million increase in net sales  the stores opened since the beginning of fiscal and our e commerce operation contributed million 
sales increased within our comparable store base by approximately million 
comparable store sales for the week period ended january  increased  driven by an increase in the average unit selling price of our footwear  which was partially offset by a decline in the number of footwear units sold 
these sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of million from the stores closed since the beginning of fiscal gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal the gross profit margin in fiscal increased to from in the prior fiscal year 
our merchandise margin increased while buying  distribution and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  decreased 
buying  distribution and occupancy costs increased approximately million during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of the operation of additional store locations 
however  our sales gain enabled us to leverage these costs by as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal to million 
significant changes in expense between the comparative periods included the following we incurred an additional million of expense during fiscal  as compared to the same period last year  in the operation of new stores and our e commerce initiative 
this increase was net of expense reductions for stores that have closed since the beginning of fiscal incentive compensation  inclusive of stock based compensation  increased million in fiscal as compared to the same period last year primarily due to our improved financial performance 
in connection with his retirement  we paid a one time retirement and severance payment of million to our former president and chief executive officer in october  which was included as incentive compensation in selling  general and administrative expenses 
also included were incentive compensation expense reductions of approximately  in fiscal to reflect the forfeiture of certain of his non vested restricted stock awards 
we experienced a year over year increase in self insured health care costs of million in fiscal as compared to the same period last year 
costs related to our self insured health care programs are subject to a significant degree of volatility  especially as it relates to the frequency of catastrophic claims 
consequently  we are subject to a risk of material variances between reporting periods 
in fiscal  pre opening costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or as a percentage of sales  as compared to million  or as a percentage of sales  for fiscal we opened stores during fiscal as compared to stores last year 
pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period in which they are incurred 
the total amount of pre opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved 
the portion of store closing costs and non cash asset impairment charges included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of seven stores  non cash asset impairment of certain underperforming stores and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
in fiscal we incurred store closing costs and non cash asset impairment charges of  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of four stores  non cash asset impairment of certain underperforming stores and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal our provision for income tax expense is based on the current estimate of our annual effective tax rate and is adjusted as necessary for quarterly events 
approximately of the increase in our effective tax rate between comparative periods was due to the non deductible portion of compensation attributable to the retirement of our former president and chief executive officer 
our fiscal effective tax rate included benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain tax positions  which lowered the effective tax rate as compared to other historical periods 
compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in fiscal  a increase over the prior year s net sales of million 
of this increase  million was attributable to the sales generated by the new stores we opened during fiscal  our e commerce business which was launched in the third quarter of fiscal along with the full year effect of sales generated by the ten stores we opened in fiscal our comparable stores sales increased for fiscal these increases in sales were partially offset by a decline in sales of million from the stores closed during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  comparable store sales were negatively impacted by a decline in consumer demand within two key product areas  toning footwear and boots 
we were able to mitigate our year over year comparable store sales loss in toning footwear as sales within the balance of the athletic category  particularly performance running  remained strong 
however  the unseasonably warm weather that was experienced late in the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal significantly impacted consumer demand for fall footwear  particularly boots 
consequently  heavy promotional activity  including markdowns  was required during the fourth quarter of fiscal to effectively sell through this inventory 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal our merchandise margin decreased while buying  distribution and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  remained unchanged 
the decrease in our merchandise margin was primarily the result of the heavy promotional activity that was required during the fourth quarter of fiscal to effectively sell through our fall footwear  particularly boots 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  however  our sales gain enabled us to leverage these costs by as a percentage of sales 
significant changes in expense between the comparative periods included the following we incurred an additional million of incremental expense during fiscal  as compared to the prior year  to support our sales growth  expanded store base and e commerce initiative 
the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to increases in wages and advertising 
during fiscal  we experienced a significant decrease in the average cost of health claims per participant as compared to recent historical periods 
our average claims per participant returned to a more normalized level in fiscal and  together with a small increase in covered employees  we experienced a year over year increase in self insured health care costs of million 
costs related to our self insured health care programs are subject to a significant degree of volatility and will continue to carry the risk of material variances between reporting periods 
the increases in selling  general and administration expenses were partially offset by a million reduction in incentive compensation for fiscal as compared to the prior year when record breaking financial performance drove material increases in performance based compensation 
pre opening costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or as a percentage of sales  in fiscal  as compared to  or as a percentage of sales  in fiscal we opened stores during fiscal and ten stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged in the period they are incurred 
the total amount of pre opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved

these costs related to the closing of seven stores  non cash asset impairment of certain underperforming stores and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal included in income tax expense for both fiscal years were benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain tax positions  which lowered our effective income tax rate as compared to other historical periods 
liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows in thousands net income plus depreciation and amortization   deferred income taxes    lease incentives    changes in operating assets and liabilities   other operating activities    net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash used in provided by financing activities  net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our planned store expansion along with other capital expenditures  working capital needs  potential dividend payments  potential share repurchases  and various other commitments and obligations  as they arise  for at least the next months 
cash flow operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal these amounts reflect our income from operations adjusted for non cash items and working capital changes 
working capital increased to million at february  from million at january  this million increase resulted primarily from a million increase in inventory to support new stores and planned sales increases  partially offset by million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders 
the current ratio was at february  and at january  cash flow investing activities our cash outflows for investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures 
during fiscal  we expended million for the purchase of property and equipment  of which million was for construction of new stores  remodeling and relocations 
during the fiscal  we expended million for the purchase of property and equipment  of which million was for construction of new stores  remodeling and relocations and approximately million was used in developing our e commerce platform 
the remaining capital expenditures in both periods were for continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
cash flow financing activities our cash inflows from financing activities were primarily proceeds from the issuance of shares as a result of stock option exercises 
cash outflows for financing activities were primarily share repurchases and  in fiscal  cash dividend payments 
shares of our common stock can be either acquired as part of a publicly announced repurchase program or withheld by us in connection with employee payroll tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock awards 
during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  during fiscal the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to the payment of million in dividends during fiscal  which included a per share special cash dividend declared and paid in december store openings and closings fiscal in fiscal  we opened new stores  including stores in the dallas fort worth metroplex and puerto rico  which were new major markets for us 
on a per store basis  the initial inventory investment for stores opened in the continental united states averaged  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentives received from landlords averaged  on a per store basis  the initial inventory investment for our new stores in puerto rico averaged million  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentive received from landlords averaged  pre opening expenses  including rent  freight  advertising  salaries and supplies  totaled approximately million for fiscal  or an average of  per store 
during fiscal  we opened new stores and expended million on pre opening expenses  or an average of  per store 
the increase in the average expenditures per new store was primarily the result of increases in pre opening freight  onsite training and support and advertising 
we closed seven stores during fiscal and four stores during fiscal capital expenditures fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be million to million in fiscal approximately million of our total capital expenditures are expected to be used for new store construction  million will be used for store relocations and million will be used to remodel approximately of our existing store base 
lease incentives to be received from landlords are expected to be approximately million to million 
the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for various other store improvements  continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of new stores opened and relocated  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the number of new store openings and relocations will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
store openings and closings fiscal our current store prototype for stores located in the continental united states uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
capital invested in these fiscal new stores is expected to average approximately  with landlord incentives averaging  the average initial inventory investment is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
our new stores opening in puerto rico in fiscal are expected to be slightly larger with an initial inventory investment of up to million 
capital invested in our puerto rican stores is expected to average  with landlord incentives averaging  during fiscal  we anticipate opening approximately to new stores and relocating seven store locations 
pre opening expenses  such as rent  freight  advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in fiscal this represents a decrease of  over our average fiscal expenditure and is primarily the result of a decrease in the average expenditure on advertising 
during fiscal  we expect to close between five and seven stores 
depending upon the results of lease negotiations with certain landlords of underperforming stores  we may increase or decrease the number of store closures in future periods 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the cost incurred in terminating the lease 
we will continue to review our annual store growth rate based on our view of the internal and external opportunities and challenges in the marketplace 
during fiscal  we expect to incur  in expense associated with these closings

the declaration and payment of any future dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our results of operations  financial condition  business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
our credit agreement permits the payment of dividends as long as the dividends distributed do not exceed of our consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal year 
the lenders under our credit agreement consented to the payment of the special cash dividend in december  which was in excess of the amount of dividends otherwise permitted to be made under our credit agreement 
share repurchase program on august   our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  which was to terminate upon the earlier of the repurchase of the maximum amount or december  since then  our board of directors has extended the date of termination to december  the purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time and in accordance with applicable laws  rules and regulations 
the program may be amended  suspended or discontinued at any time and does not commit us to repurchase shares of our common stock 
we have funded  and intend to continue to fund  the share repurchase program from cash on hand and any shares acquired will be available for stock based compensation awards and other corporate purposes

we were in compliance with these covenants as of february  should a default condition be reported  the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accrued interest at their discretion 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and letters of credit outstanding were million at february  estimated interest payments on our line of credit are not included in the above table as our line of credit provides for frequent borrowing and or repayment activities  which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosure purposes 
as of february   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
for purposes of our contractual obligations table above  we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date 
we have disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
except for operating leases  the balances included in the and after column of the contractual obligations table includes amounts where we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential future payments

off balance sheet arrangements we did not assign any store operating leases to separate third parties during fiscal we remain liable on two assignments of operating leases covering two former store locations 
we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these leases is remote  and no liability has been accrued for contingent lease obligations in our consolidated financial statements as of february  see note leases to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for further discussion 
except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  including leases for stores and equipment  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal or fiscal seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores

therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas
