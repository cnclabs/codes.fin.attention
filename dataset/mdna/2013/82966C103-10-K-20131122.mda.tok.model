this discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in results of operations in this item and elsewhere in this report 
except as otherwise disclosed all amounts are reported in us dollars 
overview sirona dental systems inc sirona  the company  we  us  and our refer to sirona dental systems  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries and their predecessors  except as otherwise indicated or unless context otherwise requires is the leading manufacturer of high quality  technologically advanced dental equipment  and is focused on developing  manufacturing and marketing innovative systems and solutions for dentists around the world 
the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from several trends in the global dental industry  such as technological innovation  increased use of cad cam systems in restorative dentistry  the shift to digital imaging  favorable demographic trends and growing patient focus on dental health and cosmetic appearance 
the company has its headquarters in long island city  new york and its largest facility in bensheim  germany 
sirona has a long tradition of innovation in the dental industry 
the company introduced the first dental electric drill approximately years ago  the first dental x ray unit approximately years ago  the first dental computer aided design computer aided manufacturing cad cam system years ago  and numerous other significant innovations in dentistry 
sirona continues to make significant investments in research and development  and its track record of innovative and profitable new products continues today with numerous product launches including cad cam for everyone with cerec software  a further differentiated milling product line  as well as apollo di launched in march  the omnicam camera unit and schick both launched in august  the orthophos xg d imaging unit launched in march  sinius treatment center launched in march  cerec software launched in march  the galileos and cerec combination launched in september  the cerec ac unit launched in january  the galileos compact d imaging system launched in july  the teneo treatment center launched in july and the cad cam milling unit mc xl launched in fiscal year sirona manages its business on both a product and geographic basis and has four segments dental cad cam systems  imaging systems  treatment centers  and instruments 
sirona has the broadest product portfolio in the industry  and is capable of fully outfitting and integrating a dental practice 
products from each category are marketed in all geographical sales regions 
the company s business has grown substantially over the past five years  driven by numerous high tech product introductions  a continued expansion of its global sales and service infrastructure  strong relationships with key distribution partners  namely patterson and henry schein  and an international dealer network 
due to the international nature of the company s business  movements in global foreign exchange rates have a significant effect on financial results 
the us market is the largest individual market for sirona  followed by germany 
between fiscal years and  the company increased us revenues from million to million  driven by innovative products  particularly in the cad cam and imaging segments and the schick acquisition 
patterson made a payment of million to sirona in july in exchange for the exclusive distribution rights for cad cam products in the us and canada until the patterson exclusivity payment 
the amount received was recorded as deferred income and is being recognized on a straight line basis commencing at the beginning of the extension of the exclusivity period in fiscal year in may  the company and patterson amended and restated the terms of their business relationship set forth in that distribution agreement with respect to distribution of certain products throughout the united states  however  it did not amend or restate the business 
table of contents relationship with respect to distribution in canada 
the amendment and restatement of the distribution agreement addressed issues related to pricing  termination and annual minimum purchase quotas  and provided growth targets which  if achieved  extend the companies exclusivity period 
in addition to strong us market growth  sirona has pursued expansion in non us and non german markets 
between fiscal years and  the company increased revenues in non us and non german markets from million to million 
to support this growth  sirona expanded its local presence and distribution channels by establishing sales and service locations eg in japan  australia  china  south korea  italy  france  brazil  and russia 
the expansion helped to increase market share but also contributed to higher sg a expenses 
in fiscal year  sirona revenues increased on a constant currency basis over a very strong prior year  in which revenues grew on a constant currency basis 
while germany was down year over year due to a challenging ids comparison  the orthophos d d launch  and a successful cad cam trade up program  we had our second best year ever in germany 
us revenues increased  and momentum continued in our non european  international markets  showing strong double digit growth above the company s average growth rate  led by asia pacific 
on a segment basis  sirona s revenue growth was broad based 
all segments posted double digit growth rates constant currency  except for instruments 
during fiscal year  we expanded our exclusive distribution agreement with patterson to include all sirona products for the us market 
this enabled us to strengthen our go to market approach and grow in the us by increasing the focus on the seamless integration of our best in class product offerings and digital solutions 
gross profit increased by million  which was partially offset by a million increase in sg a expenses 
the major driver of the increase in sg a expenses was the continued strategic expansion of our sales and service infrastructure in key growth markets 
as a result  operating income increased 
operating income included a year over year decrease in amortization of million 
operating cash flow remained strong and increased 
in fiscal year  sirona revenues increased on a constant currency basis over a strong prior year  where revenues grew on a constant currency basis 
revenues were exceptionally strong in the us  which increased  and germany  which increased constant currency 
in germany  we particularly benefitted from orders following the international dental show ids in cologne in march  where we introduced a record new products  a successful trade up program in the cad cam segment  as well as last edition sales of our renowned m treatment center unit 
us revenues benefitted from i strong demand for our imaging and cad cam products  ii the impact of implementation of the medical device tax in and anticipated changes in tax benefits in the first quarter  iii the delivery of omnicam trade ups particularly in the third and fourth quarters  and iv the expanded agreement with patterson 
on a segment basis  we experienced very strong growth in our cad cam segment  where we benefitted from the omnicam launch in august  trade up programs  as well as a generally increasing demand for products in this segment 
our new cerec omnicam camera further strengthens sirona s leadership position in the cad cam market 
the omnicam s features are particularly notable video streaming  digitization of jaw structures in their natural color  and powderless scanning of tooth surfaces 
in addition  our imaging and treatment center segments performed very well  with year over year constant currency revenue growth of and  respectively 
gross profit increased by million  which was partially offset by a million increase in sg a expenses 
sg a expenses include a total of million related to the transition agreements for the former chairman and ceo  filed as an exhibit to the company s annual report on form k on november  the transition agreement  and the departing evp and cfo  filed as an exhibit to the company s third quarter quarterly report on form q on august  the separation agreement 
the major drivers of the residual increase in sg a expenses of million were the continued strategic expansion of our sales and service infrastructure in key growth markets and expenses related to the biennial ids of million 
as a result  operating income increased 
operating income includes a year over year decrease in amortization of million 
net income was negatively impacted by losses from the revaluation of short term assets and liabilities and realized transactions  both of which were primarily driven by the fluctuations between the yen euro  euro us dollar  and brazilian real euro exchange rates 
operating cash flow remained strong and increased over the comparative prior year period 

table of contents significant factors that affect sirona s results of operations the mdp transaction and the exchange on june   sirona holdings luxco sca luxco  a luxembourg based holding entity owned by funds managed by madison dearborn partners  beecken petty o keefe  management and employees of sirona  obtained control over the sirona business 
the transaction was effected by using new legal entities  sirona holding gmbh and its wholly owned subsidiary sirona dental services gmbh  to acquire of the interest in sirona dental systems beteiligungs und verwaltungs gmbh  the former parent of the sirona business through a leveraged buy out transaction the mdp transaction 
the assets and liabilities acquired in the mdp transaction and the exchange were partially stepped up to fair value  and a related deferred tax liability was recorded 
the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including ipr d  which were expensed at the date of closing of the mdp transaction and the exchange  was allocated to goodwill and is subject to periodic impairment testing 
sirona s cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expense  and operating result have been and will continue to be materially affected by depreciation and amortization costs resulting from the step up to fair value of sirona s assets and liabilities 
foreign currency fluctuations although the us dollar is sirona s reporting currency  it conducts its business in many currencies  and its functional currencies vary depending on the country of operation 
for the fiscal year ended september   sirona s revenues denominated in euro  us dollar  and a number of other currencies represented approximately   and  respectively  whereas approximately of its operating expenses were in euro 
fluctuations in exchange rates impact sirona s financial results 
the major influencing factor is the us dollar euro exchange rate 
during the periods under review  the us dollar euro exchange rate has fluctuated significantly 
between october  and september   the us dollar euro exchange rate used to calculate items included in sirona s financial statements varied from a low of to a high of 
certain revenue information above and under results of operations below is presented on a constant currency basis 
this information is a non gaap financial measure 
sirona supplementally presents revenue on a constant currency basis because it believes this information facilitates a comparison of sirona s operating results from period to period without regard to changes resulting solely from fluctuations in currency rates 
because of the significance of the euro to its operations  sirona calculates constant currency revenue growth by comparing current period revenues to prior period revenues with both periods converted at the us dollar euro average foreign exchange rate for each month of the current period 
the average exchange rate for the fiscal year ended september   was and varied from to 
for the fiscal year ended september   an average exchange rate converting euro denominated revenues into us dollars of was applied 
although sirona does not apply hedge accounting  sirona has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to help mitigate foreign currency exposure 
as of september   these contracts had notional amounts totalling million 
as these agreements are relatively short term generally six months  continued fluctuation in the us dollar euro exchange rate could materially affect sirona s results of operations 
loans made to sirona under the new senior facilities agreement entered into on november  are denominated in the functional currency of the respective borrowers 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our new senior facilities agreement 
however  certain intra group loans and other intra group monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in the functional currency of only one of the parties to the agreements 
where intra group loans are of a long term investment nature  the potential fluctuations in exchange rates are reflected within other comprehensive income  whereas exchange rate fluctuations for short term intra group loans and other short term intra group transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
these fluctuations may be significant in any period due to changes in exchange rates  especially between the euro and the us dollar 

table of contents fluctuations in operating results sirona s operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
these variations result from a number of factors  many of which are substantially outside its control  including the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  timing of industry tradeshows  particularly the international dental show ids  changes in relationships with distributors  the timing of operational decisions by distributors and end users  developments in government reimbursement policies  changes in product mix  our ability to supply products to meet customer demand  fluctuations in manufacturing costs  tax incentives  currency fluctuations  and general economic conditions  as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries 
due to the variations which sirona has experienced in its operating results  it does not believe that period to period comparisons of results of operations of sirona are necessarily meaningful or reliable as indicators of future performance 
effective tax rate sirona s effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period and  as a global enterprise  can be influenced by many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including the result of business acquisitions and dispositions  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns  tax planning initiatives  tax characteristics of income  changes in exchange rates  as well as the timing and deductibility of expenses for tax purposes 
the company s effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings outside of the united states 
the company makes no provision for deferred us income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings because as of september   it remained management s intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
the distribution of lower taxed foreign earnings to the us would generally increase the company s effective tax rate

the cad cam segment gross profit benefited from the strong increase in sales  however  gross profit margin was below the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit margin was mainly driven by product mix  due to an increasing share of omnicam sales and from the delivery of trade ups 
the imaging segment gross profit as well as the gross profit margin mainly benefited from a strong increase in sales and favorable product mix within our intra and extra oral product portfolio 
the increase in the treatment center segment gross profit was driven by increased volume  whereas the gross profit margin decrease was mainly due to product mix 
gross profit and gross profit margin for the instruments segment were below the prior year level 
the decrease in gross profit margin was driven by the increased ratio of lower end handpieces  short term inefficiencies from the ramp up of expanded manufacturing capacity  as well as lower hygiene product sales

the distribution of lower taxed foreign earnings to the united states  however  would generally increase our effective tax rate

table of contents other financial data year ended september  year ended september  year ended september  s net income attributable to sirona dental systems  inc net interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation amortization ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is reconciled to net income  its most directly comparable us gaap measure  in the accompanying financial tables 
ebitda is defined as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
sirona s management utilizes ebitda as an operating performance measure in conjunction with us gaap measures  such as net income and gross margin calculated in conformity with us gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with us gaap 
there are material limitations associated with making the adjustments to sirona s earnings to calculate ebitda and using this non gaap financial measure 
for instance  ebitda does not include interest expense  and because sirona has borrowed money in order to finance its operations  interest expense is a necessary element of its costs and ability to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense  and because sirona uses capital and intangible assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of its costs and ability to generate revenue  and tax expense  and because the payment of taxes is part of sirona s operations  tax expense is a necessary element of costs and impacts sirona s ability to operate 
in addition  other companies may define ebitda differently 
ebitda  as well as the other information in this filing  should be read in conjunction with sirona s consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
in addition to ebitda  the accompanying financial tables also set forth certain supplementary information that sirona believes is useful for investors in evaluating sirona s underlying operations 
this supplemental information includes gains losses recorded in the periods presented which relate to share based compensation  revaluation of the us dollar denominated exclusivity payment and borrowings where the functional currency is the euro  and the one time non cash compensation charge resulting from a payment by certain former shareholders of the company to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company 
sirona s management believes that these items are either nonrecurring or non cash in nature  and should be considered by investors in assessing sirona s financial condition  operating performance and underlying strength 
sirona s management uses ebitda together with this supplemental information as an integral part of its reporting and planning processes and as one of the primary measures to  among other things i monitor and evaluate the performance of sirona s business operations  ii facilitate management s internal comparisons of the historical operating performance of sirona s business operations  iii facilitate management s external comparisons of the results of its overall business to the historical operating performance of other companies that may have different capital structures and debt levels  iv analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments  and v plan for and prepare future annual operating budgets and determine appropriate levels of operating investments

contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years s long term debt operating lease obligations pension purchase commitments total includes expected interest payments and agency commitment fees represents unconditional purchase commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year off balance sheet arrangements in july  sirona entered into a sale and leaseback agreement regarding unused land on the bensheim site of sirona in germany 
the land was sold for euro million million at the us dollar euro exchange rate of september  to an unrelated property development company  who constructed an office building based on sirona s specifications on the site 
sirona leases the building from the property development company through a year lease 
rental payments started in april when the building was ready for occupancy 

table of contents under the terms of the lease  rent is fixed at euro million million at the us dollar euro exchange rate of september  per annum until after  rent is subject to adjustment according to an inflation index 
the land remains an asset on sirona s balance sheet and the building has been accounted for as an operating lease 
sirona does not have other off balance sheet financing arrangements other than its derivatives 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires sirona to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information sirona believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to sirona s estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in its estimates and assumptions from time to time 
the following accounting policies are those that sirona believes to be the most sensitive to its estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition the company s main revenue stream results from the delivery of dental equipment 
the company also enters into revenue arrangements that consist of multiple deliverables of its product and service offerings 
additionally  certain products  primarily in our cad cam and imaging segments  may contain embedded software that functions together with the product to deliver the product s essential functionality 
revenue  net of related discounts and allowances  is recognized when products or equipment have been shipped  when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  title and risk of loss has passed to customers based on the shipping terms  no significant obligations remain  and allowances for discounts  returns  and customer incentives can be reliably estimated 
the company offers discounts to its distributors if certain conditions are met 
discounts and allowances are primarily based on the volume of products purchased or targeted to be purchased by the individual customer or distributor 
discounts are deducted from revenue at the time of sale or when the discount is offered  whichever is later 
the company estimates volume discounts based on the individual customer s historical and estimated future product purchases 
returns of products  excluding warranty related returns  are infrequent and insignificant 
amounts received from customers in advance of product shipment are classified as deferred income until the revenue can be recognized in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy 
services service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term as the specified services are performed 
amounts received from customers in advance of rendering of services are classified as deferred income until the revenue can be recognized upon rendering of those services 
extended warranties the company offers its customers an option to purchase extended warranties on certain products 
the company recognizes revenue on these extended warranty contracts ratably over the life of the contract 
the costs associated with these extended warranty contracts are recognized when incurred 
multiple element arrangements meas arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables  including any combination of equipment  services  and extended warranties 
the deliverables included in the company s meas are separated into more than one unit of accounting when i the delivered equipment has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and ii delivery of the undelivered service element s is probable and substantially in the control of the company 
arrangement consideration is then allocated to each unit  delivered or undelivered  based on the relative selling price rsp of each unit of 
table of contents accounting based first on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if it exists and then based on estimated selling price esp 
vsoe in most instances  products are sold separately in stand alone arrangements 
services are also sold separately through renewals of contracts with varying periods 
the company determines vsoe based on its pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately  considering geographical  customer  and other economic or marketing variables  as well as renewal rates or stand alone prices for the service element s 
esp the estimated selling price represents the price at which the company would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand alone basis 
when vsoe does not exist for all elements  the company determines esp for the arrangement element based on sales  cost and margin analysis  as well as other inputs based on its pricing practices 
adjustments for other market and company specific factors are made as deemed necessary in determining esp 
after separating the elements into their specific units of accounting  total arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting according to the nature of the revenue as described above and application of the rsp method 
total recognized revenue is limited to the amount not contingent upon future transactions 
pensions and k plan the company has defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and an early retirement plan 
as of september   the company adopted the recognition provisions of asc  compensation retirement benefits defined benefit plans pension 
upon adoption  sirona recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income the funded status of its benefit plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of september   net of related tax effects 
beginning in fiscal year  sirona recognizes changes in the funded status of its benefit plans  not yet recognized in the income statement  in other comprehensive income until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over the employee s approximate service periods 
defined benefit pension costs are determined by using an actuarial method  which provides for the deferral of actuarial gains and losses in excess of a specified corridor that result from changes in assumptions or actual experience differing from that assumed 
costs relating to changes in the benefit plan as well as the transition obligation are amortized 
disclosure of the components of periodic pension cost is also required 
when purchase accounting is applied  pension liabilities are recognized for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets 
the key assumption used in the actuarial calculations for the defined benefit pension plans is the selection of the appropriate discount rate 
the discount rate has been selected by reference to market interest rates 
the discount rate used reflects the rates available on high quality fixed income investment of appropriate duration at the measurement dates of each year 
fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
the discount rate assumption changed from at september  to at september   thereby affecting the amount of pension obligation recorded at september  plan assets consist of insurance policies with a guaranteed minimum return by the insurance company and an excess profit participation feature for a portion of the benefits 
sirona pays the premiums on the insurance policies but does not manage the investment of the funds  the insurance company makes all decisions on investment of funds  including the allocation to asset groups 
the fair value of the plan assets such as equity securities  fixed income investments  and others is based on the cash surrender values reported by the insurance company 

table of contents contributions made to the defined contribution pension plans and the k savings plan for us employees are accrued based on the contributions required by the plan 
the company also has an early retirement plan  altersteilzeit atz  which allows certain german employees who have been accepted into the plan to retire at rather than at the legal retirement age of eligible employees are those who have attained the age of  have completed years of service  and have been accepted to participate in the atz plan 
accepted employees join for a period of years  during which they work in full active service for of the agreed atz plan period  the remaining of the plan period being the passive phase during which the employee does not work 
alternatively  the employee may work for of the time for the entire agreed atz plan period 
the alternative actually executed is decided via mutual agreement between sirona and the employee 
during the active service period  the employees receive of their salary plus a bonus payment equal to of their salary  and the remaining of their salary  plus a bonus payment equal to of their salary  is paid during the inactive service period 
the company recognizes the salary component of the atz plan over the period from the beginning of the atz period to the end of the active service period 
income taxes sirona recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
sirona regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance  as necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
if sirona is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  it could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
as of september   sirona had recorded valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
further information on income taxes is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of asc and other complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
impairment of long lived and finite lived assets sirona assesses all its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
sirona s management assesses whether there has been an impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities with the carrying value of the asset 
the factors considered by sirona s management in this assessment include operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
if an impairment is deemed to exist  management records an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 

table of contents impairment of indefinite lived assets the company elected to early adopt asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment  for the fiscal year goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter 
the adoption of this guidance did not affect our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is allocated to each of our reporting units  which we regard to be our operating segments dental cad cam systems  imaging systems  treatment centers  and instruments 
sirona assesses goodwill for impairment annually on september unless an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value at an earlier date 
this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of its reporting units is more likely than not less than their carrying values 
the company evaluates such qualitative factors as i the results of the last quantitative impairment assessment  ii macro and industry economic conditions such as significant changes in the business and legal climate and competition  and iii company specific assumptions including historical data and experience  operating performance indicators  projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows  expected long term growth rates  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  the development of its stock price  and other factors 
if we determine that the fair value is more likely than not less than the carrying value  or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit  goodwill is tested for impairment under the two step valuation test 
the first step is to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare this estimated fair value with each reporting unit s carrying value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  additional steps  including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  would be necessary to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment 
in this second step  a fair value exercise similar to a business combination would be performed where the individual identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are valued at fair value with the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit being the implied fair value of goodwill 
as of september   based on the qualitative assessment  the company determined that step one of the impairment test is not required 
if we would determine the fair value of a reporting unit  we would use a discounted future cash flow model to estimate reporting unit fair value 
significant assumptions in a discounted cash flow model would include discount rate  revenue and gross profit margin growth and terminal growth rates based on our judgments  estimates and assumptions 
the company elected to early adopt asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets  similar to the guidance on goodwill impairment testing in asu  together with asu for the fiscal year impairment test performed in the fourth quarter 
the adoption of this guidance did not affect our consolidated financial statements 
sirona evaluates trademarks and in process research and development ipr d  which are considered indefinite lived intangible assets until the associated projects are completed  for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value might be impaired 
in performing this assessment  sirona s management employs a systematic methodology that considers qualitative and quantitative evidence in evaluating whether an impairment is likely to have occurred 
these factors include operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
if an impairment is likely to have occurred  as estimate of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is performed 
the carrying value is considered impaired when it exceeds the fair market value 
in such an event  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount of that excess 
key assumptions in determining fair value include using the expected discounted cash flows 
once an impairment is determined  an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sirona s primary market risk exposure is foreign currency risk  which can adversely affect our revenues and operating profits 
to help mitigate this risk  sirona enters into forward exchange contracts 
sirona is also exposed to interest rate risk associated with short and long term bank loans bearing variable interest rates 
to help mitigate this interest rate risk exposure  sirona enters into interest rate swap agreements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with notes   and to sirona s audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  which provide further information on sirona s derivative instruments 
exchange rate sensitivity the euro is the functional currency for the majority of sirona s subsidiaries  including its german operations  which are the primary sales and manufacturing operations of sirona 
sales from other sirona operations are denominated in various foreign currencies 
sales in euro  us dollar and a number of other currencies represented approximately  and  respectively  of total sales for fiscal year in order to hedge portions of the transactional exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  based on forecasted and firmly committed cash flows  sirona enters into forward foreign currency different from functional currency contracts 
these forward foreign currency contracts are intended to reduce short term effects of changes in exchange rates 
sirona does not apply hedge accounting to these forward foreign currency contracts 
a significant portion of our senior term loan is denominated in euro 
the euro denominated part of the senior term loan was granted to one of our german subsidiaries  whose functional currency is the euro 
accordingly  the company does not consider this facility to be a foreign currency risk sensitive instrument 
the table below provides information  as of september   about receivables and derivative financial instruments by functional currency and presents such information in us dollars  which is sirona s reporting currency 
the table summarizes information only for those instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates 
the estimated fair value of receivables is considered to approximate their carrying value because receivables have a short maturity 
a receivable denominated in euro held by subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro is not sensitive to exchange rate changes 
the table below includes only those euro receivables held by subsidiaries with non euro functional currencies 
likewise  a receivable denominated in us dollars held by entities whose functional currency is the us dollar is not sensitive to exchange rate changes 
the table below includes only those us dollar receivables held by subsidiaries with non us dollar functional currencies 
for foreign currency forward exchange agreements  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
these notional amounts generally are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract
