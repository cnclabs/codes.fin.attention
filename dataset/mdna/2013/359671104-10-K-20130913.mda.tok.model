these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements  including without limitation an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate  which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies  an expiration or contraction of available credit and or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities  interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results  particularly if we elect to use leverage as part of our investment strategy  currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies  particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than us dollars  and the risks  uncertainties and other factors we identify in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in our filings with the sec

these risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an externally managed non diversified closed end management investment company formed in april  and have elected to be treated as a business development company under the act 
our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments 
we are managed by full circle advisors  and full circle service company provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate 
we invest primarily in senior secured loans and  to a lesser extent  mezzanine loans and equity securities issued by smaller and lower middle market companies that operate in a diverse range of industries 
in our lending activities  we focus primarily on portfolio companies with both i tangible and intangible assets available as collateral and security against our loan to help mitigate our risk of loss  and ii cash flow to cover debt service 
we believe this provides us with a more attractive risk adjusted return profile  with greater principal protection and likelihood of repayment 
our investments generally range in size from million to million  however  we may make larger or smaller investments from time to time on an opportunistic basis 
we focus primarily on senior secured loans and stretch senior secured loans  also referred to as unitranche loans  which combine characteristics of 
table of contents traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans 
we believe that having a first lien  senior secured position provides us with greater control and security in the primary collateral of a borrower and helps to mitigate risk against loss of principal should a borrower default 
our stretch senior secured loans typically possess a greater advance rate against the borrower s assets and cash flow  and accordingly carry a higher interest rate and or greater equity participation  than traditional senior secured loans 
this stretch senior secured loan instrument can provide borrowers with a more efficient and desirable solution than a senior bank line combined with a separate second lien or mezzanine loan obtained from another source 
we also may invest in mezzanine  subordinated or unsecured loans 
in addition  we may acquire equity or equity related interests from a borrower along with our debt investment 
we attempt to protect against risk of loss on our debt investments by securing our loans against a significant level of tangible or intangible assets of our borrowers  which may include accounts receivable and contracts for services  and obtaining a favorable loan to value ratio  and in many cases  securing other financial protections or credit enhancements  such as personal guarantees from the principals of our borrowers  make well agreements and other forms of collateral  rather than lending predominantly against anticipated cash flows of our borrowers 
we believe this allows us more options and greater likelihood of repayment from refinancing  asset sales of our borrowers and or amortization 
we generally seek to invest in smaller and lower middle market companies in areas that we believe have been historically under serviced  especially during and after the credit crisis 
these areas include industries that are outside the focus of mainstream institutions or investors due to required industry specific knowledge or are too small to attract interest from larger investment funds or other financial institutions 
because we believe there are fewer banks and specialty finance companies focused on lending to these smaller and lower middle market companies  we believe we can negotiate more favorable terms on our debt investments in these companies than those that would be available for debt investments in comparable larger  more mainstream borrowers 
such favorable terms may include higher debt yields  lower leverage levels  more significant covenant protection or greater equity grants than typical of other transactions 
we generally seek to avoid competing directly with other capital providers with respect to specific transactions in order to avoid the less favorable terms we believe are typically associated with such competitive bidding processes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following items as critical accounting policies 
basis of consolidation under the act rules  the regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x and the american institute of certified public accountants audit and accounting guide for investment companies  we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services and benefits to us 
our financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of full circle west  inc  fc new media inc  transamerican asset servicing group  inc  fc new specialty foods  inc  and fc takoda holdings  llc  our only wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
valuation of investments in securities at fair value definition and hierarchy in accordance with gaap  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  full circle capital s board of directors uses various valuation approaches 
in accordance with gaap  a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 

table of contents observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the board of directors 
unobservable inputs reflect the board of directors assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows level valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access 
valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to level securities 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
the availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors including  the type of security  whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace  and other characteristics particular to the transaction 
to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation  those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
accordingly  the degree of judgment exercised by the board of directors in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in level in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  for disclosure purposes  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls  is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  the company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
the company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date  including periods of market dislocation 
in periods of market dislocation  the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many securities 
this condition could cause a security to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy 
change in realized gain loss and unrealized gain loss on investments net unrealized appreciation or depreciation recorded on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized 
realized gain loss on the sale of investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their stated costs 
from time to time the company may enter into a new transaction with a portfolio company as a result of the sale  merger  foreclosure  bankruptcy or other corporate event involving the portfolio company 
in such cases  the company may receive newly issued notes  securities and or other consideration in exchange for  or resulting from  the cancellation of the instruments previously held by the company with regard to that portfolio company 
in such cases  the company may experience a realized loss on the instrument being sold or cancelled  and  concurrently  an elimination of any previously recognized unrealized losses on the portfolio investment 
such elimination of unrealized loss is included on the statements of operations as an increase in the change in unrealized gain loss on investments 

table of contents valuation techniques senior and subordinated secured loans our portfolio consists primarily of private debt instruments level debt 
the company considers its level debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default  the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner  the loan is in covenant compliance or is otherwise not deemed to be impaired 
in determining the fair value of the performing level debt  the company s board of directors considers fluctuations in current interest rates  the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings  financial condition of the borrower  economic conditions and other relevant factors  both qualitative and quantitative 
in the event that a level debt instrument is not performing  as defined above  the company s board of directors will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the level debt instrument 
this evaluation will be updated no less than quarterly for level debt instruments  and more frequently for time periods where there are significant changes in the investor base or significant changes in the perceived value of the underlying collateral 
the collateral value will be analyzed on an ongoing basis using internal metrics  appraisals  third party valuation agents and other data as may be acquired and analyzed by management and the company s board of directors 
investments in private companies the company s board of directors determines the fair value of its investments in private companies by incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties  expected cash flows and market based information  including comparable transactions  and performance multiples  among other factors  including third party valuation agents 
these nonpublic investments are included in level of the fair value hierarchy 
warrants the company s board of directors ascribes value to warrants based on fair value analyses that may include discounted cash flow analyses  option pricing models  comparable analyses and other techniques as deemed appropriate 
fair value the company s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the requirements of asc topic at june  and were as follows as of june

use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements of full circle capital in conformity with gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts disclosed in the financial statements of full circle capital 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
current market conditions and market opportunity we believe that the current credit environment provides favorable opportunities to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns on the types of senior secured loans and other investments we may target 
in particular  we believe that  despite an overall fall off in loan demand due to the depressed economic conditions  demand for financing from smaller to lower middle market companies is largely outpacing the availability of lenders that have traditionally served this market 
we believe that bank consolidations  the failure of a number of alternative lending vehicles due to poor underwriting practices and an overall tightening of underwriting standards has significantly reduced the number and activity level of potential lenders 
we believe there has long been a combination of demand for capital and an underserved market for capital addressing smaller and lower middle market borrowers 
we believe there is robust demand for continued growth capital as well as demand from very significant refinancing requirements of many borrowers as debt facilities come due  given the lack of willing and qualified capital providers 
we believe these market conditions have been further exacerbated in the current environment due to larger lenders exiting this market to focus on larger investment opportunities which are more appropriate for their operating cost structures  the elimination of many specialized lenders from the market due to lack of capital as a result of  for instance  the closing off of the securitization market or their own poor performance  and the need for certain capital providers to reduce lending activities due to their reduced access to capital and the overall deleveraging of the financial market 

table of contents with the decreased availability of debt capital for smaller to lower middle market borrowers  combined with the significant demand for refinancing  we believe there are increased lending opportunities for us 
as always  we remain cautious in selecting new investment opportunities  and will only deploy capital in deals which are consistent with our disciplined philosophy of pursuing superior risk adjusted returns 
waiver and expense reimbursement our investment adviser agreed to waive the portion of the base management fee that exceeded of full circle capital s gross assets  as adjusted  until august  when such waiver expired the management fee waiver 
in addition  our investment adviser agreed to reimburse the company for any operating expenses  excluding interest expenses  investment advisory and management fees  and organizational and offering expenses  in excess of of our net assets for the first twelve months following the completion of the initial public offering  which occurred on august  the expense reimbursement agreement 
this agreement was extended through september  and expired on such date 
portfolio composition and investment activity our portfolio of investments consists primarily of senior secured loans and  to a lesser extent  mezzanine loans and equity securities issued by smaller and lower middle market companies 
our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
as of june   debt investments in our portfolio bore interest at a fixed rate  and the remaining debt investments bore interest at variable rates  representing approximately million and million in principal debt  respectively 
the variable rates are based upon the prime rate or libor 
to illustrate the potential impact of a change in the underlying interest rate on our net investment income  we have assumed a increase in the underlying prime rate or libor  and no other change in our portfolio as of june  we have also assumed outstanding borrowings by the company of million  with million having a floating rate based upon libor 
under this analysis  net investment income would increase by approximately million annually 
if we had instead assumed a decrease in the underlying prime rate or libor  net investment income would decrease by approximately million 
although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity at june   it does not adjust for changes in the credit quality  size and composition of our portfolio  and other business developments  including borrowing under a credit facility  that could affect the net increase in net assets resulting from operations 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
we may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates
