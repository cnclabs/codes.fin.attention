production facility expansion in oxford  pennsylvania on april   the company announced plans to expand the production facility of our oxford  pennsylvania plant and add a new bread production line that will help the company provide fresh bread to the growing market in pennsylvania and the surrounding areas 
we decided to invest approximately million over two years based on the expectation that the project will receive economic support and assistance from the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
we expect that a second investment of approximately million in a production line for buns will be made in the future 
we intend to fund these future cash needs with cash on hand  our existing credit facility and equipment leases 
business flowers is focused on opportunities for growth within the baked foods category and seeks to have its products available wherever baked foods are consumed whether in homes  restaurants  fast food outlets  or institutions 
delivery methods and segments the company has structured a network of bakeries through much of the us to serve retail and foodservice customers with fresh bakery items  such as breads  rolls  buns  and snack cakes 
we have two distinct delivery systems for delivering our products 
first  the dsd segment products are delivered fresh to customers through a network of independent distributors who are incentivized to grow sales to build equity in their distributorships 
the second delivery system is found in the warehouse segment  which ships fresh or frozen products to customers warehouses and customers then distribute these products to their individual depots  stores  or restaurants 
our manufacturing facility locations have been assigned to either the dsd or warehouse segment depending on which method is used to deliver and sell their products 
the dsd segment operates a highly involved system of reciprocal baking whereby individual bakeries have an assigned production mission to produce certain items for their own market as well as for other dsd bakeries markets 
this system allows for long and efficient production runs that help the company maintain its position as a low cost producer 
bakeries within regional networks exchange products overnight through a third party transportation system so that at the beginning of each sales day  every bakery in the dsd segment has a full complement of fresh products for its independent distributors as they service their retail and foodservice customers 

table of contents the company has invested significant capital in its bakeries for several decades to ensure its production is as efficient as possible  uses technology effectively  provides consistently excellent quality  and offers a good working environment for team members 
in fiscal years   and  the company had capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
the comparatively larger amount of capital expenditures in fiscal was from the completion of our bakery in bardstown  kentucky 
consumers and our product portfolio the company recognizes the need to stay in touch with changing consumer trends regarding baked foods 
as a result  ongoing research on consumer preferences is conducted and outside resources tapped to stay current on changing taste  flavor  texture  and shape trends in bakery products and food in general 
our marketing  quality assurance  and research and development staffs collaborate regularly as new products are considered  developed  tested  and introduced 
brands are important in the bakery category and the company has invested over several decades in its brand portfolio through advertising  promotion and packaging 
nature s own  introduced in  was developed to address the developing trend of consumers demanding baked foods with a healthier profile 
nature s own  from inception  offered baked foods with no artificial flavors  colors  or preservatives 
more recently  nature s own has removed high fructose corn syrup from its recipes and also added specific healthier ingredients such as fiber and omega through the years  the company product offering has included some form of cake 
in recent years  snack cakes have been developed and introduced under several brands  such as bluebird and mrs 
freshley s 
on may   the company acquired tasty baking co 
tasty 
tasty operates two bakeries in pennsylvania and serves customers primarily in the northeastern u 
s 
with an extensive line of tastykake branded snack cakes 
the tastykake brand adds an iconic snack cake brand to our brand portfolio 
tasty s revenues  before the acquisition reached its one year anniversary in fiscal  were million 
in addition  approximately million of sales was from the introduction of the tastykake products into our core markets 
we will continue to roll out the tastykake brand into flowers core markets through our core markets in this case are defined as markets in existence immediately preceding the tasty acquisition 
strengths and core competencies we aim to achieve consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by focusing on improvements in the operating results of our existing businesses and  after detailed analysis  acquiring businesses and properties that add value to the company 
we believe this strategy will result in consistent and sustainable growth that will build value for our shareholders 
the company is also committed to maintaining a collaborative information technology group that meets all of our bakeries needs and maximizes efficiencies where available 
the consumer packaged goods industry has used scan based trading technology referred to as pay by scan or pbs over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer 
an extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer 
in addition  pbs permits the manufacturer to more accurately track trends in product sales and manage inventory 
we have developed long term goals over five year time horizons and have communicated these goals broadly to the investment community and to internal audiences 
compensation and bonus programs are set with benchmarks to the company s long term goals 
the majority of our employees participate in an annual formula driven  performance based cash bonus program 
in addition  certain employees participate in a long term incentive program that provides performance contingent common stock awards that generally vest over a two year period 
we believe these incentive programs provide both a short and long term goal for our most senior management team and aligns their interests with those of shareholders 
we believe our highly automated bakeries that focus on quality permit us to bake products that meet consumers needs 
we also strive to maintain service levels for customers  consumers  and suppliers that exceed what is expected 
the design of our delivery systems and segments permits us to allocate management time and resources to meet consumers expectations 

table of contents competition and risks in january  hostess filed for bankruptcy for the second time since in november  they filed a liquidation motion seeking permission to shut down and sell assets 
this was approved on november  at that time hostess immediately stopped production and sold out their remaining inventory 
they discontinued serving their customers by late november these events impacted the industry as these sales shifted to other providers to meet consumers needs 
these providers included flowers  grupo bimbo the arnolds  thomas  and entenmann s brands  campbell soup company the pepperidge farm brands  smaller regional bakeries  retailer owned bakeries  and store brands 
sales are principally affected by pricing  quality  brand recognition  new product introductions  product line extensions  marketing and service 
sales for fiscal increased from fiscal this increase was primarily due to the lepage acquisition in fiscal and the tasty acquisition in fiscal which together contributed of sales growth  increased volume  and increased pricing mix 
our sales increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal by  which was primarily driven by volume increases and the lepage acquisition 
while we expect sales to grow  we cannot guarantee at what level considering the current economic environment and competitive landscape in the baking industry 
until the completion of the hostess liquidation in bankruptcy  the baking industry will continue to see market fluctuations in the near term as companies compete for market position 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  periodically experience price fluctuations  and  for that reason  we continually monitor the market for these commodities 
the cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation  weather conditions  domestic and international demand or other unforeseen circumstances 
we anticipate that our commodity costs will rise during we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices 
any decrease in the availability of these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly affect our earnings 
critical accounting estimates note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues  expenses and cash flows during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  raw materials  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the selection and disclosure of the company s critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
the following is a review of the critical assumptions and estimates  and the accounting policies and methods listed below  which are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  derivative instruments  
table of contents valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  self insurance reserves  income tax expense and accruals  pension obligations  and share based payments 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records both direct and estimated reductions to gross revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive 
these allowances include price promotion discounts  coupons  customer rebates  cooperative advertising  and product returns 
price promotion discount expense is recorded as a reduction to gross sales when the discounted product is sold to the customer 
coupon expense estimates are calculated and recorded as a reduction to gross sales using the number of coupons dropped to consumers and the estimated redemption percentage and value  at the time the coupons are issued 
estimates for customer rebates assume that customers will meet the estimates of required quantities to qualify for payment and are recorded as a reduction to gross sales 
cooperative advertising expense is recorded as a reduction to gross sales based on our portion of the estimated advertising cost of the underlying program and are recognized at the time the advertising takes place 
product returns are recorded as a reduction to gross sales based on the actual returns in the week following the quarter end 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue 
the consumer packaged goods industry has used scan based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer 
an extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer 
consequently  revenue on these sales is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer 
this technology is referred to as pbs 
the company began a pilot program in fiscal  working with certain retailers to develop the technology to execute pbs  and there has been a sharp increase in its use since that time 
the company believes it is a baked foods industry leader in pbs and utilizes this technology with a majority of its larger retail customers 
in fiscal the company recorded million in sales through pbs 
the company will continue to implement pbs technology for current pbs customers as they open new retail stores during in addition  new pbs customers will begin implementation during revenue on pbs sales is recognized when the product is purchased by the end consumer because that is when title and risk of loss is transferred 
non pbs sales are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer since that is when title and risk of loss is transferred 
derivative instruments 
the company s cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to certain commodities markets 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  experience price fluctuations 
if actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting our results of operations 
we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting to manage the impact of volatility in raw material prices 
the company measures the fair value of its derivative portfolio using fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market for that asset or liability 
when quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities are not available  the company bases fair value on internally developed models that use current market observable inputs  such as exchange quoted futures prices and yield curves 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company records an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when  based on certain indicators of impairment  it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor 
table of contents operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to long lived assets were recorded for fiscal years  or the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired using a two step process 
we have elected not to perform the qualitative approach 
the first step of this evaluation is performed by calculating the fair value of the business segment  or reporting unit  with which the goodwill is associated 
our reporting units are at the segment level 
each segment consists of several components 
these components are aggregated by their respective delivery method into the warehouse delivery segment and dsd segment 
these segments rely on reciprocal baking among its components  cross sells its products brands within the segment  and utilize the same delivery method 
marketing  research and development and capital projects are measured at the segment level 
we believe these factors support our reporting unit classifications 
this fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit  and if less than the carrying value  the goodwill is measured for potential impairment under step two 
under step two of this calculation  goodwill is measured for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  determined in the same manner as a business combination  with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
our annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires management judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies incorporating market participant considerations and management s assumptions on revenue  revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates  and ebitda defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our estimates can significantly affect the outcome of the test 
we perform the fair value assessment using the income and market approach 
we use this data to complete a separate fair value analysis for each reporting unit 
changes in our forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates 
this test is performed in our fourth quarter unless circumstances require this analysis be completed sooner 
the income approach is tested using a sensitivity analysis to changes in the discount rate and yield a sufficient buffer to significant variances in our estimates 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded our carrying values by at least million in each reporting unit 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to goodwill were recorded for the fiscal years   or in connection with acquisitions  the company has acquired trademarks  customer lists and non compete agreements  which are intangible assets subject to amortization 
the company evaluates these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the undiscounted future cash flows of each intangible asset is compared to the carrying amount  and if less than the carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the fair value is computed using the same approach described above for goodwill and includes the same risks and estimates 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to amortizable intangible assets were recorded for the fiscal years   or the company also owns trademarks acquired in acquisitions that are indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization of million 
a total of million of the trademarks were from the lepage acquisition that occurred in july the company evaluates the recoverability by comparing the fair value to the carrying value of these intangible assets on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in addition  the assets are evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life 
the fair value is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset  and if less than the carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to fair value 
the fair value is computed using the same approach described above for goodwill and includes the same risks and estimates 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to intangible assets not subject to amortization were recorded for the fiscal years   or 
table of contents self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  auto liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental coverage 
insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis and are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims and historical trends and data 
though the company does not expect them to do so  actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated 
material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
income tax expense and accruals 
the annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material effect on the annual tax rate 
the effect of these changes  if any  would be recognized when the change takes place 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserve for uncertain tax benefits reflect our best assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance  which could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
periodically we face audits from federal and state tax authorities  which can result in challenges regarding the timing and amount of income or deductions 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it more likely than not that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements that may impact the ultimate payment of such potential exposures 
while the ultimate outcome of audits cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not currently believe that future audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company is no longer subject to federal examination for years prior to pension obligations 
the company records pension costs and benefit obligations related to its defined benefit plans based on actuarial valuations 
these valuations reflect key assumptions determined by management  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans portfolios  past performance of these assets  the anticipated future economic environment and long term performance of individual asset classes  and other factors 
material changes in pension costs and in benefit obligations may occur in the future due to experience different than assumed and changes in these assumptions 
future benefit obligations and annual pension costs could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
effective january   the company curtailed its largest defined benefit plan that covered the majority of its workforce 
benefits under this plan were frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under this plan 
the company continues to maintain another defined benefit plan that covers a small number of union employees 
effective august   the company assumed sponsorship of two defined benefit plans as part of the butterkrust acquisition 
benefits under these plans are frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under these plans 
these plans were merged into the company s largest defined benefit plan at december  effective may   the company assumed sponsorship of three defined benefit plans as part of the tasty acquisition 
benefits under these plans are frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under these plans 
two of the tasty defined benefit plans are nonqualified plans covering former employees 
one of these nonqualified plans was terminated and all benefit obligations of the plan were settled effective december  the tasty qualified defined benefit plan was merged into the company s largest defined benefit plan at december  the company recorded pension cost of million for fiscal we expect pension income of approximately million for fiscal 
table of contents a sensitivity analysis of fiscal pension costs on a pre tax basis and year end benefit obligations for our qualified plans is presented in the table below amounts in thousands for changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets eroa percentage increase decrease discount rate discount rate eroa eroa estimated change in fy pension costs estimated change in fy year end benefit obligations   n a n a the discount rate used by the company reflects rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the company looks to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments to determine its discount rate 
the company uses a cash flow matching technique to select the discount rate 
the expected cash flows of each pension plan are matched to a yield curve based on aa graded bonds available in the marketplace at the measurement date 
a present value is developed  which is then used to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date  the company considers the plan assets historical actual returns  targeted asset allocations  and the anticipated future economic environment and long term performance of individual asset classes  based on the company s investment strategy 
while appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance  the assumption represents management s best estimate of the long term prospective return 
based on these factors the long term rate of return assumption for the plans was set at for fiscal  as compared with the average annual return on the plans assets over the past years of approximately net of expenses 
the expected long term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of equity securities  fixed income securities  real estate  other diversifying strategies including  absolute return funds  hedged equity funds  and guaranteed insurance contracts  and short term investments and cash 
the company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
pension costs do not include an explicit expense assumption and the return on assets rate reflects the long term expected return  net of expenses 
for the details of our pension plan assets  see note  postretirement plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the company determines the fair value of substantially all of its plans assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans projected benefit obligations pbo 
if the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds of the larger of i the pbo or ii the market value of plan assets  the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the expected average future lifetime of participants in the frozen pension plans 
the total unrecognized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of december  for the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
the total unrecognized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of december  for the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
the company uses a calendar year end for the measurement date since the plans are based on a calendar year and because it approximates the company s fiscal year end 
amortization of this unrecognized loss during fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
to the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized  the loss will increase the company s pension costs in the future 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value 
the company recognizes these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate  and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of the share based payment award 
employee grants issued before fiscal included non qualified stock options nqso and performance contingent stock awards psa 
the nqso were valued using a black scholes option pricing model 
the inputs for the model include an expected life  risk free rate  expected volatility and dividend yield 

table of contents the psa incorporated a market and performance condition component 
however  because of the market condition the expense amount would only change if we determined the performance condition was triggered 
the performance condition was always satisfied and adjustments were never made 
the market condition was dependent on certain market benchmarks but the expense for these awards never changed 
in fiscal we granted additional psa that separately have a market and performance condition 
the expense computed for the total shareholder return shares tsr shares is fixed and recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the expense computed for the return on invested capital roic shares can change depending on the attainment of performance condition goals 
the expense for the roic shares can be within a range of to of the target 
there is a possibility that this expense component will change in subsequent quarters depending on how the company performs relative to the roic target 
results of operations matters affecting analysis reporting periods 
the company operates on a week fiscal year ending the saturday nearest december fiscal  and consisted of weeks 
fiscal will consist of weeks

liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments as well as our ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert into cash those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financing objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist primarily of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives 
currently  the company s liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the company s strategy for use of its cash flow 
table of contents includes paying dividends to shareholders  making acquisitions  growing internally and repurchasing shares of its common stock  when appropriate 
the potential acquisition of the hostess assets  described in the overview above  is expected to require approximately million in cash 
the sara lee and earthgrains asset purchases  described in the overview above  are expected to require approximately million in cash 
the company leases certain property and equipment under various operating and capital lease arrangements 
most of the operating leases provide the company with the option  after the initial lease term  either to purchase the property at the then fair value or renew its lease at the then fair value 
the capital leases provide the company with the option to purchase the property at a fixed price at the end of the lease term 
the company believes the use of leases as a financing alternative places the company in a more favorable position to fulfill its long term strategy for the use of its cash flow

table of contents the change in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the tasty acquisition in fiscal and the lepage acquisition in fiscal depreciation and amortization increased million for these acquisitions from fiscal to fiscal the change in stock based compensation was primarily because the long term incentive grant occurred in july and was a different type of grant than those prior to fiscal the provision of allowance for accounts receivable increased because sales increased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal the sales increase affected the accounts receivable balance for sales that occurred in the quarter but which were not paid until the increase in inventory was because the company increased materials on hand to keep up with sales demand 
the pension and postretirement plan expense increased because the unfunded liability of the plans increased from the prior year 
other non cash items include non cash interest expense for the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs and gains or losses on the sale of assets 
the changes in accounts receivable and inventories are described above and are due to sales increases 
hedging activities change from market movements that affect the fair value and required collateral of positions and the timing and recognition of deferred gains or losses 
these changes will occur as part of our hedging program 
this change was not applicable to fiscal and causes the large variance when comparing fiscal activity to fiscal activity 
the other assets and accrued liabilities changes are from changes in income tax receivable balances  deferred tax liabilities  accrued interest and accrued employee costs including accrued compensation for our formula driven  performance based cash bonus program 
note  other current assets  note  other accrued liabilities  and note  income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k list material items for additional context to changes in working capital 
the company s derivative instruments contained no credit risk related contingent features at december  as of december   the company had million recorded in other current assets  and on january   the company had million recorded in other current assets representing collateral from or with counterparties for hedged positions 
in fiscal  there were required pension contributions under the minimum funding requirements of erisa and the pension protection act of ppa to our qualified plans of million and discretionary contributions of million 
in addition  there were million in nonqualified pension benefits paid from corporate assets during fiscal despite an average annual return on plan assets of net of expenses over the last fifteen years  contributions in future years are expected to increase because of the significantly lower than expected asset returns during which have not fully recovered 
during  the company expects to contribute million to our qualified pension plans and expects to pay million in nonqualified pension benefits from corporate assets 
the expected contributions to qualified pension plans represent the estimated minimum pension contributions required under erisa and the ppa as well as discretionary contributions to avoid benefit restrictions 
the company believes its cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without adversely affecting the business strategy of the company 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company estimates payments totaling million  including our share of employment taxes and deferred compensation contributions  relating to its formula driven  performance based cash bonus program 
we paid million during the first quarter of for the performance based cash bonus program earned during fiscal

capital expenditures for the dsd and warehouse segments were million and million  respectively 
the company estimates capital expenditures of approximately million to million on a consolidated basis during fiscal the change in the distributor territories repurchased and the principal payments on notes receivable are due to the tasty acquisition in fiscal tasty incorporates the same distributor model the company uses and  as a result  the activity in these line items increased in fiscal prior to the acquisition  and currently  lepage generally does not use the independent distributor model to deliver their products 
however  this is expected to change in the future 
we intend to implement the independent distributor model at lepage in the near future 
this will cause changes in the amount outstanding under the distributor notes in fiscal and beyond which will affect the principal payments received in the future 
the company sold several lease back properties in fiscal that caused a significant change when compared to fiscal also the contingent acquisition consideration payment in fiscal was from an acquisition that occurred in fiscal there are no additional contingent acquisition consideration payments outstanding at this time

while there are no requirements to increase the dividend payout we have shown a recent historical trend to do so 
should this continue in the future we will have additional working capital needs to meet these expected payouts 
stock option exercises and the associated tax windfall benefit increased slightly 
as of december  there were nonqualified stock option grants of  shares that were exercisable 
these have a remaining contractual life of approximately years and a weighted average exercise price of 
table of contents per share 
at this time  it is expected that these shares will be exercised before the contractual term expires and they may provide an increase to the cash provided by financing activities 
stock repurchase decisions are made based on our stock price  our belief of relative value  and our cash projections at any given time 
payments for debt issuance costs and financing fees increased because we incurred fees for the senior notes issued in april and the amendment to the credit facility in november the change in bank overdraft was a function of our cash receipts at the end of our fiscal our cash objective is to minimize cash on hand by using the credit facility described below 
the net debt obligations increased primarily from the senior notes issued in april the notes are due in april and will require million to satisfy the obligation at that time 
at this time we do not anticipate an issue with meeting this obligation 
at december   there was million due under our term loan by august in four equal payments 
the first of these payments was made on december  this is presently recorded as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect to be able to make these payments from cash provided by operations or from drawing down the current credit facility 
the credit facility is variable rate debt  as described below 
in periods of rising interest rates the cost of using the credit facility will become more expensive and increase our interest expense 
the stated interest rate of the senior notes will not change and the term loan will be paid off during fiscal therefore  draw downs on the credit facility provide us the greatest direct exposure to rising rates 
in addition  if interest rates do increase it will make the cost of raising funds more expensive 
considering our current debt obligations  an environment of rising rates could materially affect our consolidated statements of income 
additional liquidity items are discussed below for context 
senior notes  credit facility  and term loan senior notes 
on april   the company issued million of ten year senior notes the senior notes 
the company will pay semiannual interest on the notes on each april and october  beginning on october   and the notes will mature on april  on any date prior to january   the company may redeem some or all of the notes at a price equal to the greater of of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and a make whole amount plus  in each case  accrued and unpaid interest

the notes are also subject to customary restrictive covenants  including certain limitations on liens and sale and leaseback transactions

restrictive financial covenants include such ratios as a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
the company believes that  given its current cash position  its cash flow from operating activities and its available credit capacity  it can comply with the current terms of the new credit facility and can meet presently foreseeable financial requirements

distributor arrangements 
the company offers long term financing to independent distributors for the purchase of their territories  and a vast majority of the independent distributors elect to use this financing alternative 
the distributor notes generally have terms of up to ten years  and the distributors pay principal and interest weekly 
a majority of the independent distributors have the right to require the company to repurchase the territories and trucks  if applicable  at the original price paid by the distributor on the long term financing arrangement in the six month period following the sale of a territory to the independent distributor 
if the truck is 
table of contents leased  the company will assume the lease payment if the territory is repurchased during the first six month period 
if the company had been required to repurchase these territories  the company would have been obligated to pay million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
after the six month period expires  the company retains a right of first refusal to repurchase these territories 
additionally  in the event the company exits a territory or ceases to utilize the independent distribution form of doing business  the company is contractually required to purchase the territory from the independent distributor for ten times average weekly branded sales 
if the company acquires a territory from an independent distributor that is to be resold  the company operates the territory until it can be resold 
if the territory is not to be resold  the value of the territory is charged to earnings 
the company held an aggregate of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  of distributor notes 
the company does not view this aggregate amount as a concentrated credit risk  as each note relates to an individual distributor 
the company has approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively  of territories held for sale 
the increase was primarily the result of higher turnover for expansion market distributor territories  certain routes that were repurchased for route restructuring  and the territories held for sale from the lepage acquisition of million 
we anticipate selling these territories in the lepage distribution area in the near future 
in the ordinary course of business  when an independent distributor terminates its relationship with the company  the company  although not legally obligated  generally purchases and operates that territory utilizing the leased truck of the former distributor 
to accomplish this  the company operates the leased truck for the distributor  who generally remains solely liable under the original truck lease to the third party lessor  and continues the payments on behalf of the former distributor 
once the territory is resold to an independent distributor  the truck lease is assumed by the new independent distributor

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued guidance for offsetting netting assets and liabilities 
this guidance requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement 
this includes derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements 
these disclosures allow users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
in january an amendment was issued for this guidance 
this amendment clarifies that the scope applies to derivative accounting including bifurcated embedded derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  and interim periods within those annual periods 
these requirements are retrospective for all comparative periods 
the company is still analyzing the potential impact of this guidance on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the guidance allows an entity the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the company is analyzing the potential impact of this guidance on the company s consolidated financial statements 
information regarding non gaap financial measures the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
however  from time to time  the company may present in its public statements  press releases and sec filings  non gaap financial measures such as  ebitda  gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization  and adjusted operating income to measure the performance of the company and its operating divisions 

table of contents ebitda is used as the primary performance measure in the company s annual executive bonus plan 
the company defines ebitda as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization 
the company believes that ebitda is a useful tool for managing the operations of its business and is an indicator of the company s ability to incur and service indebtedness and generate free cash flow 
furthermore  pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  ebitda is used to determine the company s compliance with certain financial covenants 
the company also believes that ebitda measures are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as measures of a company s operating performance and debt servicing ability because ebitda measures assist in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation  amortization  interest expense income or taxes which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods and non operating factors such as historical cost 
ebitda is also a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted operating income includes costs that we consider important to present to investors 
these include  but are not limited to  the costs of closing a plant or costs associated with merger related activities 
we believe that financial information excluding certain gaap transactions not considered to be part of the ongoing business improves the comparability of earnings results 
we believe investors will be able to better understand our earnings results if these transactions are excluded from the results 
these non gaap financial measures are measures of performance not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the unites states and should be considered in addition to  not in lieu of  gaap reported measures 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to a income from operations or net income loss as a measure of operating performance  b cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s ability to meet its cash needs  or c any other indicator of performance or liquidity that has been determined in accordance with gaap 
our method of calculating ebitda and adjusted ebitda may differ from the methods used by other companies  and  accordingly  our measure of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization is used as a performance measure to provide additional transparent information regarding our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis 
changes in depreciation and amortization are separately discussed and include depreciation and amortization for materials  supplies  labor and other production costs and operating activities 
presentation of gross margin includes depreciation and amortization in the materials  supplies  labor and other production costs according to gaap 
our method of presenting gross margin excludes the depreciation and amortization components  as discussed above 
this presentation may differ from the methods used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
our website has the documents that provide a reconciliation of our net income  the most comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda from continuing operations  a reconciliation of our gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization to gaap gross margin  a reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to gaap earnings per share  a reconciliation of free cash flow to gaap operating cash flow  adjusted ebitda to gaap operating cash flow  and a reconciliation of gaap operating income to adjusted operating income
