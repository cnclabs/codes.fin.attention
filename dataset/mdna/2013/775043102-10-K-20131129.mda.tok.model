the following table illustrates the company s contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long and short term debt pension obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations interest obligation other short and long term obligations reflected on the registrant balance sheet total purchase obligations include payments due under various types of agreements to purchase raw materials  services  or other goods 
note uncertain tax benefit liabilities of million are not included in the company s contractual obligation table  as the company cannot make reasonable estimates about the timing of any required payments related to these liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or financing arrangements involving variable interest entities  except for the remaining unused credit lines amounting to million 
currency exchange rate fluctuations although the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in us dollars  approximately of its net sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro  swedish krona  swiss francs  british pound  singapore dollar  taiwanese dollar  korean won  japanese yen  canadian dollar  indian rupee  and chinese rmb 
net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses 
exchange differences upon translation from each operation s functional currency to us dollars are accumulated as a separate component of equity 
the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity had the effect of increasing total equity by million at september   as compared to million at september  the fluctuation of the euro and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods 
the company defines the term constant currency to mean that financial data for a period are translated into us dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate financial data for the previously reported period 
changes in sales  gross profit  and income from operations include the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company management reviews and analyzes business results on a constant currency basis and believes these results represent the company underlying business trends without distortion due to currency fluctuations 
the company believes that this constant currency financial information is a useful measure for investors because it reflects actual changes in operations 
the following chart compares our net sales  gross profit  and income from operations for each of fiscal years   and  to the equivalent financial results calculated on a constant currency basis 
because this constant currency financial information does not conform to generally accepted accounting principles  it is presented under the caption non gaap constant currency fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year gaap actual non gaap constant currency gaap actual non gaap constant currency gaap actual non gaap constant currency in millions net sales gross profit income from operations between fiscal year and  the average exchange rate for the euro strengthened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of fluctuations in exchanges rates of foreign currencies against the us dollar was to increase net sales by million and to decrease gross profit by million  because approximately of fiscal year sales were denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
these exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing operating expense by million  thereby decreasing income from operations by million 
between fiscal year and  the average exchange rate for the euro weakened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this weakening was to decrease net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of sales were denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
this weakening of the euro had the effect of decreasing operating expenses by million  thereby increasing income from operations only by million 
between fiscal year and  the average exchange rate for the euro strengthened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this strengthening was to increase net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of fiscal year sales were denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
these exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing operating expense by million  thereby increasing income from operations by million 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are also described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for uncollectible customer accounts receivable based on historical experience 
additionally  an allowance is made based on an assessment of specific customers financial condition and liquidity 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
no individual customer represents more than of total accounts receivable 
any increase in allowance will impact operating income during a given period 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  after provisions for excess and obsolete inventory salable at prices below cost 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on current assessments about historical experience and future product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
we also write down up to ninety percent of our total demo inventory costs over thirty six months 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
the company evaluates the adequacy of these provisions quarterly 
although the company strives to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory excess or obsolescence  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional provisions may be needed 
any changes in provisions will impact operating income during a given period 
warranty reserves the company provides reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties when revenue is recognized 
the company relies upon historical experience  expectations of future conditions  and its service data to estimate its warranty reserve 
the company continuously monitors these data to ensure that the reserve is sufficient 
warranty costs have historically been within our expectations 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims such costs may include material  labor  and travel costs  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
increases in reserves will impact operating income during the period 
pension obligations the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions in calculating those amounts 
assumptions are made about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  total turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  the company provides the actuarial consultants with subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop their calculations of these amounts 
the company generally reviews these assumptions at the beginning of each fiscal year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that the company uses may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension benefits expense the company has recorded or may record 
another key assumption in determining the net pension expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations 
the company us plan uses a cash flow matching approach  which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria 
we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements 
our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances and or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
share based payment stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite vesting period 
we make judgments about the fair value of the awards  including the expected term of the award  volatility of the underlying stock and estimated forfeitures  which impact the amount of compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
such amounts may change as a result of additional grants  forfeitures  modifications in assumptions  and other factors 
the income tax effects of share based payments are recognized in the financial statements for those awards which will normally result in tax deductions under existing tax law 
under current us federal tax laws  we receive a compensation expense deduction related to stock options only when those options are exercised and vested shares are received 
accordingly  the financial statement recognition of compensation cost for stock options creates a deductible temporary difference which results in a deferred tax asset and a corresponding deferred tax benefit in the income statement for all us based employees 
stock compensation expense related to non us employees is treated as a permanent difference for income tax purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance requiring changes to the presentation of comprehensive income which requires entities to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
these changes  with retrospective application  became effective for the company in fiscal year other than the change in presentation to report comprehensive income as a separate but consecutive statement  these changes did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
the amendments under asu allow entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments included a number of events and circumstances for entities to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
entities now have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
asu was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  fiscal year for the company 
adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of september  in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu amended asc  balance sheet  to converge the presentation of offsetting assets and liabilities between us gaap and ifrs 
asu requires that entities disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
in january  the fasb issued asu which limited the scope of this guidance to derivatives  repurchase type agreements  and securities borrowing and lending transactions 
the guidance from these updates is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after january   which is the company s fiscal year the company does not believe the adoption will have a significant impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu requires reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the financial statements or in a note to the financial statements 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  as such  asu will be effective october   for the company and will be applied prospectively 
the company does not believe the adoption will have a significant impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb amended guidance related to a parent company s accounting for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity 
this guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december   and is to be applied prospectively to derecognition events occurring after the effective date 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on its financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu  inclusion of the fed funds effective swap rate or overnight index swap rate as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes 
the update permits the fed funds effective swap rate to be used as a us benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under fasb asc topic  in addition to the interest rates on direct treasury obligations of the us government ust and the london interbank offered rate libor 
the update also removed the restriction on using different benchmark rates for similar hedges 
asu has no effect on the financial statements as of september   but will be applicable to any hedging activity the company enters into after july  in july  the fasb issued guidance on financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
under this guidance an unrecognized tax benefit  or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit  should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward  except as follows 
to the extent a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use  and the entity does not intend to use  the deferred tax asset for such purpose  the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets 
these amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the company does not believe the adoption will have a significant impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
other accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the company financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity as of september   the company maintained cash equivalents and short term investments of million  consisting mainly of non taxable interest bearing securities and demand deposits all with maturities of less than one year

as of september   the company had million of variable rate debt on which the interest rate is reset every three months  million of variable rate debt on which the interest rate is reset every six months  million of variable rate debt on which the interest rate is reset every twelve months  and million of fixed rate debt 
maturities of this debt are as follows million is due in  million is due in  million is due in  million is due in  million is due in  million is due annually from through  and million is due in a change in the variable interest rates of the company s debt would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of less than million 
the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements to minimize the interest expenses on a portion of its variable debt described in the previous paragraph by shifting from variable to fixed interest rates 
one swap agreement is for a total notional amount of euro million equivalent to million based on the exchange rate at september  and the other is for a total notional amount of swiss francs million equivalent to million based on the exchange rate at september  
foreign currency exchange risk the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and forward exchange options generally of less than one year duration to hedge a portion of its foreign currency risk on sales transactions 
at september   the company held japanese yen forward exchange contracts with notional amounts of euro million and million
