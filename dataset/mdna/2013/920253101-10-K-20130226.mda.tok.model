table of contents results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal overview on a consolidated basis  the increase in net sales in fiscal  as compared with  was due to the following factors unit sales volumes increased approximately million in fiscal  as compared with all reportable segments contributed to the higher sales volumes  with the most significant unit sales increases within the utility support structures and irrigation segments 
depending on the segment  unit volumes are measured in tons  units or some other physical measure of volume 
sales prices and mix in fiscal  as compared with  were favorable  resulting in increased sales of approximately million 
as many of our products are either built to order or configured to customer specifications  sales mix can be due to a number of factors  in addition to pricing 
these factors may include product specifications  options and other factors that may affect the unit price at which a product is sold 
in some cases  pricing and mix may affect our cost of the product sold 
fiscal included weeks of operations  as compared with fiscal  which was weeks 
this was the result of our fiscal year ending the last saturday in december 
accordingly  all fiscal operational figures were higher than had the fiscal year been weeks in length 
the estimated effect of our fiscal net sales and net earnings due to the extra week of operations was approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency translation factors  in the aggregate  resulted in lower net sales and operating income in fiscal  as compared with on average  the us dollar strengthened against most currencies in the most significant currencies that contributed to this movement were the euro  brazilian real and the south african rand 
on a segment basis  the approximate currency effects on net sales and operating income in fiscal  as compared with  were as follows in millions of dollars net sales operating income engineered infrastructure products utility support structures coatings irrigation other corporate total the increase in gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal  as compared with  was primarily due to improved sales pricing and mix and moderating raw material costs in as compared with steel prices and zinc prices in were down slightly as compared with lifo expense in fiscal was lower than  contributing to the comparatively higher gross profit margin in  as compared with selling  general and administrative sg a expense in fiscal  as compared with  increased mainly due to the following factors increased compensation expenses of approximately million  associated with increased employment levels and increased employee benefit costs  
table of contents increased employee incentive accruals of approximately million  due to improved operating results  and deferred compensation expense of million incurred in fiscal associated with the increase in deferred compensation plan liabilities 
the corresponding increase in deferred compensation plan assets was recorded as a decrease in other expense 
these increases were offset to a degree by foreign exchange transaction effects of million 
sg a spending as a percent of sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  as we achieved leverage of the fixed portion of sg a expense in light of the sales increase 
the increase in operating income on a reportable segment basis in fiscal  as compared with  was due to improved operating performance in all reportable segments 
the most significant increases were in the irrigation and utility segments 
the decrease in net interest expense in fiscal  as compared with  was the net effect of lower interest expense of million and lower interest income of million 
the decrease in interest expense was attributable to interest savings realized from the refinancing of our million of senior subordinated debt in june and approximately million of expense incurred in the second quarter of related to the refinancing of our million of senior subordinated notes 
the decrease in interest income was due to interest received on certain income tax refunds in average borrowing levels in were comparable with the decrease in other expenses in fiscal  as compared with  of million was mainly due to investment returns in the assets held in our deferred compensation plan of million 
the increase in the value of these assets was offset by a corresponding increase in our deferred compensation liabilities  which was reflected as an increase in sg a expense 
accordingly  there was no effect on net earnings from these investment gains 
our effective income tax rate in fiscal of was higher than the effective rate of 
our effective tax rate in was abnormally low  mainly due to tax benefits associated with the legal entity restructuring of delta ltd 
in the fourth quarter of aside from these non recurring benefits  our effective tax would have been approximately 
our effective tax rate in was affected by the following factors that contributed to increased income tax expense in  the uk reduced its income tax rate from to 
as a result  our income tax expense increased in by million  mainly due to the revaluation of deferred income tax assets  and  adjustments to the final accounting calculations related to the legal restructuring of delta ltd 
resulted in a million unfavorable adjustment 
going forward  depending on our geographic mix of earnings and currently enacted income tax rates in the countries in which we operate  we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 
earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was lower in  as compared with  mainly due to lower net earnings in those consolidated operations that are less than owned  the most significant of what was the manganese dioxide operation 
in addition  million of the decrease was due to our purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our grinding media operation in june this operation was previously owned by noncontrolling interests 
our cash flows provided by operations were million in  as compared with million in while net earnings in fiscal was comparable with  million of fiscal earnings was due to tax benefits resulting from the delta ltd 
legal reorganization  which were non cash in nature 

table of contents engineered infrastructure products eip segment the increase in eip segment net sales in fiscal  as compared with  was due to improved sales volumes of approximately million  million of favorable pricing and sales mix changes  offset to a degree by unfavorable foreign exchange translation effects of approximately million 
the pricing increases largely followed raw material inflation realized in in the lighting product line  north american sales in were up modestly from the increase in sales resulted from higher sales prices and favorable sales mix 
the transportation market for lighting and traffic structures continues to be steady but not particularly strong 
while a two year extension to the current us highway funding legislation was enacted in the third quarter of  this event has not yet affected the market for lighting and traffic structures 
we also believe that state budget issues are limiting roadway project activity 
sales in other market channels such as sales to lighting fixture manufacturers and commercial construction projects in were comparable with in europe  lighting sales in fiscal were lower than we divested our turkish and italian operations in late  resulting in lower sales in  as compared with  of million 
current economic conditions in europe are weak and uncertain 
as a result  public spending for streets and highways is under pressure  as governments cope with lower tax receipts and budget deficits 
however  lighting sales in local currency were higher in  as compared with stronger sales in france  scandinavia and the uk were offset somewhat by weaker sales volumes in northern europe 
lighting sales in the asia pacific region in fiscal were comparable with communication product line sales in fiscal were improved over north america sales in were million higher than the increase in sales was attributable to improved market conditions somewhat attributable to the build out of g wireless technology and the resolution of the proposed at t t mobile merger  which we believe slowed sales activity for structures and components in in china  sales of wireless communication structures in were comparable with sales in the access systems product line in were improved as compared with  as industrial production investments in the mining and energy economic sectors are increasing in the asia pacific region 
sales of highway safety products in were slightly higher than while public spending on roadways in australia did not grow in  establishment of sales channels in other countries in the asia pacific region contributed to sales volume increases for the product line 
operating income for the segment in fiscal was higher than improved operating income resulted from higher sales volumes  improved sales prices and moderating raw material costs including million of lower lifo expense 
these improvements were offset by factory productivity issues that negatively affected operating income by approximately million 
the productivity matters mainly were due to excessive start up costs associated with capacity expansions in the us and various factory productivity matters in the europe and asia pacific regions 
the increase in sg a spending in  as compared with  mainly was attributable to higher compensation costs of million and increased employee incentives of million 
these increases were offset to a degree by a million write down in a trade name recorded in and currency translation effects of million 
utility support structures utility segment in the utility segment  the sales increase in the  as compared with  was primarily due to improved unit sales volumes of approximately million 
in us markets  investments in the electrical grid by utility companies is increasing  resulting in improved sales of transmission and substation structures 
the effect of sales mix was favorable in  as compared with  by approximately million 
sales mix was mainly related to certain large orders that were taken in and early  when market pricing was particularly low 
as market conditions improved  pricing 
table of contents recovered to a degree  resulting in improved pricing and mix as the year progressed 
sales in international markets in fiscal were improved over sales in the asia pacific region are higher  offset to some extent by lower sales in europe and the middle east 
operating income in fiscal  as compared with  increased due to the increase in north america sales volume  moderating raw material costs and leverage effects on fixed sg a and factory expenses 
these positive effects were offset to a degree by million of additional rework and other unanticipated costs related to certain large orders 
the increase in sg a expense for the segment in fiscal as compared with  was mainly due to increased employee compensation of million and increased sales commissions of million  associated with the increase in business levels 
coatings segment coatings segment sales to outside customers in fiscal was comparable with  as improved sales in the united states was offset to a degree by lower sales in the asia pacific region 
in the united states  we experienced broad based improved demand from customers  especially in the agriculture  petrochemical and energy economic sectors  which included higher sales for galvanizing services to our other segments 
asia pacific volumes in were down from  due to slowness in the australian industrial economy not related to mining 
average selling prices in were comparable with the increase in segment operating income in  as compared with  was mainly due to improved productivity and operating leverage through volume increases and lower zinc costs 
the effect of lower zinc costs on segment operating income in  as compared with  was approximately million 
sg a expenses for the segment in  as compared with  were slightly lower  mainly due to a million favorable dispute settlement with a vendor in and a million write down of a trade name recorded in in  we completed the insurance settlement related to the storm and fire at one of our facilities in australia 
settlements in totaled million  as compared with million in  which were recorded in operating income 
irrigation segment the increase in irrigation segment net sales in  as compared with  was mainly due to improved sales volumes of approximately million and favorable pricing and sales mix of approximately million 
these increases were offset by unfavorable currency translation effects of approximately million in  as compared with the pricing and sales mix effect was generally due to sales price increases that took effect in the second half of to recover higher material costs in early in global markets  the sales growth was due to very strong agricultural economies around the world 
farm commodity prices continue to be favorable  with a positive outlook for net farm income in most markets around the world 
we believe that farm commodity prices have been favorable due to strong demand  including consumption in the production of ethanol and other fuels  and traditionally low inventories of major farm commodities 
we believe the drought conditions in much of the us this summer contributed to the increased demand for irrigation equipment and related service parts in the very dry growing conditions throughout much of the us highlight the benefits of irrigation in order to maintain crop yields under these circumstances 
in international markets  the sales improvement in fiscal  as compared with  was also realized in most markets due to generally favorable economic conditions in the global farm economy 
operating income for the segment improved in  as compared with  due to improved sales unit volumes and improved sales prices in light of stable material costs 
the higher average selling prices resulted from rising material costs in  when sales price increases lagged material cost inflation 
the stability in raw material purchase costs also resulted in million in lower lifo expenses in  as compared with sg a expenses in were comparable with fiscal 
table of contents other this category includes the grinding media  industrial tubing  electrolytic manganese and industrial fasteners operations 
in  sales were lower than  mainly due currency translation effects of million and slightly lower sales in grinding media 
operating income in was comparable with  as improvement in tubing was offset by lower operating earnings in our manganese dioxide operation 
net corporate expense net corporate expense in fiscal was higher than  mainly due to higher employee incentives of million associated with improved net earnings and share price  which affected long term incentive plans  and  higher deferred compensation expenses approximately million related to investment returns on assets in the deferred compensation plan 
these increases are offset by decreases in other expense 
these increases were offset by lower corporate spending in various areas  including lower expenses for the delta pension plan of million 
fiscal compared with fiscal acquisition of delta plc on may   we acquired delta plc delta 
the total amount of the acquisition was million and was financed by a combination of cash  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement of million and million of senior unsecured notes 
we began consolidating delta financial results in our consolidated financial statements beginning on may  on a segment reporting basis  delta operations are included in our results as follows engineered infrastructure products eip segment manufacture of poles  roadway safety systems and access systems  utility support structures utility segment manufacture of pole structures  coatings segment galvanizing operations in australia  the us and asia  and other manufacture of steel grinding media and electrolytic manganese dioxide the increases in sales and operating income by segment attributable to a full year effect of delta in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  were as follows in millions fiscal year ended december  net sales operating income engineered infrastructure products utility support structures coatings other net corporate expense total 
table of contents overview on a consolidated basis  the increase in net sales in fiscal  as compared with  was primarily the result of improved sales in all reportable segments  part of which was the result of delta financial results being included in our consolidated financial statements for all of in addition  fiscal included weeks of operations  as compared with fiscal  which was weeks 
this was the result of our fiscal year end being on the last saturday in december 
accordingly  all fiscal operational figures were higher than had fiscal been weeks in length 
the estimated impact on our net sales and net earnings due to the extra week of fiscal was approximately million and million  respectively 
for the company as a whole  without consideration of delta  our increase over was mainly due to increased unit sales volumes of approximately million 
on a reportable segment basis  the most significant unit sales volume increase were in the irrigation and utility segments 
sales prices overall were up modestly in fiscal  as compared with  mainly in response to rising steel prices 
in the aggregate  the sales increase in  as compared with  due to price increases and sales mix changes was approximately million 
our fiscal sales and operating income in comparison to were enhanced by foreign currency translation 
on average  the us dollar was weaker than most global currencies in as compared with these effects by segment were as follows in millions of dollars net sales operating income engineered infrastructure products utility support structures coatings irrigation other corporate total the decrease in gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal  as compared with  was due to higher average raw material costs in as compared with in particular  steel prices rose significantly in the first quarter of before moderating somewhat in the following two quarters 
average zinc costs also were higher in than in these higher costs were not recovered entirely through increased selling prices  mainly due to a competitive selling price environment  especially in the eip and utility segments 
in the aggregate  we estimate that the impact of these factors in  as compared with  was approximately million 
selling  general and administrative sg a spending in fiscal  as compared with  increased due to the following factors expenses associated with the full year delta operations million in our consolidated accounts in  increased employee incentive accruals of million  due to improved operating results  and  increased compensation expenses of million  associated with increased employment levels and salary increases 
these increases were somewhat offset by million in lower acquisition and integration costs in the fiscal  as compared with  associated with the delta acquisition 

table of contents the increase in operating income on a reportable segment basis in  as compared with  was due to improved operating performance in the irrigation  utility and coatings segments reported improved operating income in fiscal  as compared with the eip segment operating income in was lower than fiscal the other category also reported improved operating profit in  as the grinding media  tubing and manganese dioxide operations were improved over currency translation effects also contributed to the increase in operating income in fiscal  as compared with  of approximately million 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal  as compared with  was attributable to million of expense incurred when we redeemed our senior subordinated debt  million of expense related to the full year effect of interest expense associated with the million in senior unsecured notes issued in april  less  million of bank fees incurred in the first quarter of fiscal to provide the required bridge loan funding commitment for the delta acquisition and the full year effect of interest income from delta cash balances approximately million 
the increase in other expense in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to investment losses in the assets held in our deferred compensation plan of million 
the decrease in the value of these assets was offset by a corresponding decrease in our deferred compensation liabilities  which were reflected as a decrease in net corporate expense 
accordingly  there was no effect on net earnings from these investment losses 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of currency translation losses due the dissolution of our joint venture in turkey 
our effective income tax rate in fiscal was substantially lower than this reduction was mainly due to tax benefits associated with a legal restructuring of delta in the fourth quarter of the restructuring was completed to gain certain operational efficiencies and resulted in an aggregate income tax benefit of million related to an increase in the tax basis of assets in australia and removing valuation allowances to certain uk deferred tax assets associated with tax loss carryforwards 
the restructuring will allow us to generate uk based income sufficient to utilize those tax loss carryforwards 
see critical accounting policies income taxes for a more detailed discussion of the legal restructuring and the associated tax 
in  we realized an unfavorable effect in related to non deductibility of a portion of the delta acquisition expenses approximately million 
in  the following items resulted in favorable effects to income taxes income tax benefits associated with our acquisition of the remaining of donhad that we did not own million  income tax provisions in our south african manganese dioxide operation that were no longer needed due to a favorable tax authority ruling million  net effect of certain income tax contingencies in that were reduced due to expiration of statutes of limitation million 
aside from these events that are non recurring in nature  we believe our effective tax rate in fiscal and would have been approximately 
earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was higher in  as compared with  mainly due to improved earnings in our manganese dioxide operation  which is owned by noncontrolling interests 
earnings in non consolidated subsidiaries improved in  as compared with  as our owned manganese materials operation experienced improved profitability 
the improvement in net earnings and earnings per share in  as compared with  were mainly attributed to the improved operating income and the tax benefits associated with the legal entity restructuring in million and per share  respectively 
see critical accounting 
table of contents policies income taxes for a more detailed discussion of the legal restructuring and the associated tax effects 
our cash flows provided by operations were approximately million in  as compared with million in while net earnings increased in  as compared with  operating cash flow was slightly lower than due mainly to the following factors higher levels of working capital to support increased business activity in the utility and irrigation segments in the income tax benefits associated with the legal entity restructuring completed in the fourth quarter of million were non cash in nature  and  contributions to the delta pension plan of million in engineered infrastructure products eip segment the increase in net sales in fiscal as compared with was mainly due to the full year effect of the delta operations and currency translation effects 
global lighting markets continue to experience relatively weak demand  resulting in increased price competition  despite higher raw material prices 
in the lighting product line  north american sales in were down slightly as compared with market conditions in north america continue to be weak  especially in the transportation market  where funding is through federal  state and local governments 
we believe sales demand in the transportation market was dampened by the lack of a long term federal highway funding legislation and state budget deficits  as the lack of long term funding legislation does not give the various states ample visibility to implement long term initiatives 
furthermore  highway spending sponsored under the federal program requires the various states to provide part of required funding 
many states are in budget deficits  which may constrain their ability to access federal matching funds to implement roadway projects 
sales in other market channels helped to offset the lower transportation market sales in  as compared with in europe  sales unit volumes were approximately million higher in fiscal  as compared with however  sales pricing and product mix generally were unfavorable in light of higher material costs  due to weaker infrastructure spending in europe related to budget deficit control measures and public debt issues 
communication product line sales in fiscal were comparable to north america sales were slightly higher in than while market conditions were generally more favorable in as compared with  we believe uncertainty surrounding the at t t mobile merger has caused demand for communication structures and components to slow down in the last half of in china  sales of wireless communication structures were slightly higher in fiscal  as compared with in  annual supply contracts with chinese wireless carriers were settled later than in the past and was more in line with what we believe is a more normal demand pattern 
sales in the access systems product line in australia in were comparable with  not including the full year effect from the delta acquisition  as industrial construction was overall stable and mining investment was in the early stages of project feasibility and scope 
asia sales in this product line were higher by approximately million in as compared with  as markets in the region generally were stronger  particularly in china  indonesia and the middle east 
sales of highway safety products in were comparable with in local currency terms  not including the full year effect from the delta acquisition 
floods in parts of australia affected infrastructure spending in the first two quarters of  as public spending priorities shifted from roadway development to supporting recovery from the floods 
operating income for the segment in fiscal was lower as compared with while operating income was enhanced by the full year effect of the delta operations and currency translation 
table of contents effects  the impact of higher raw material costs  slowness in demand and very competitive pricing conditions in most of our lighting markets hampered operating income for the segment by approximately million in  as compared with the operating income associated with the delta operations  aside from the full year effect of the acquisition  was comparable with the strong australian dollar led to pricing and margin pressures  as imported products from outside of australia were more competitive from a pricing standpoint 
in europe  we were affected by competitive pricing pressures that negatively affected segment operating profit by approximately million in  as compared with the increase in sg a expense in fiscal was mainly due to the acquisition of the delta operations million  currency translation effects of million and the fourth quarter write down of the pirod trade name of million 
utility support structures utility segment in the utility segment  the sales increase in fiscal  as compared with  was due to improved unit sales volumes in the us  offset to a degree by lower sales prices in the us and lower sales volumes in international markets 
in us markets  electrical utility companies are increasing their investment in the electrical grid over a relatively slow the sales pricing environment is slowly improving but continues to be very competitive 
our sales in were somewhat reflective of market conditions in when certain utility structures projects were awarded at relatively low prices 
in total  we experienced slightly lower average selling prices on our sales  as compared with approximately million 
in international markets  the sales decrease was mainly due to lower project sales into emerging markets of approximately million 
operating income in fiscal  as compared with  increased due to the substantial increase in north america sales volume and associated operational leverage 
gross profit margins were negatively affected by the competitive pricing environment in north america and higher raw material costs 
the increase in sg a expense for the segment in fiscal was higher than in  mainly due to increased employee incentives million associated with the increase in operating income and million in increased compensation expenses 
coatings segment net sales in the coatings segment increased in fiscal  as compared with  mainly due to the full year effect of the delta operations and currency translation effects and improved sales volumes in north america and asia pacific 
unit pricing effects on sales for the segment were not significant in  as compared with the increase in segment operating income in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to the effects of currency translation and improved productivity and operating leverage through volume increases 
higher average zinc costs in  as compared with  were largely recovered through productivity improvements 
the increase in operating income in fiscal  as compared with  also was due to the effect of the acquired delta operations 
sg a expenses for the segment in fiscal were higher than the comparable periods in  mainly due to the effect of the delta businesses million  incentives due to improved operating income million and the write down of the industrial galvanizers of america trade name million in in  one of our galvanizing facilities in australia incurred damages from a storm and a fire later in the year 
a property damage and business interruption claim was filed with our insurance carrier and settlement of the claim is ongoing 
we made the necessary capital expenditures to restore the facility and operations commenced late in the fourth quarter of the insurance claim proceeds agreed to with the insurance carrier in exceeded the net book value of the assets damaged 
the financial effect of this event resulted in an improvement in segment operating results in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 

table of contents irrigation segment the increase in irrigation segment net sales in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to improved sales volumes of approximately million 
the remainder of the sales increase was associated with pricing to recover higher raw material costs and favorable product mix approximately million and currency translation effects approximately million 
in global markets  the sales growth was due to a very strong agricultural economies around the world 
farm commodity prices were generally favorable throughout and net farm income was at record levels in the united states and favorable in most markets 
we believe that farm commodity prices have been favorable due to strong demand  including consumption in the production of ethanol and other fuels  and traditionally low inventories of major farm commodities 
in addition  weather conditions in north america in were generally drier than  further enhancing demand for irrigation machines and related service parts 
in international markets  the sales improvement in fiscal  as compared with  was realized in most markets  particularly in asia pacific and south america 
operating income for the segment improved in over  due to improved sales unit volumes in north america and the associated operational leverage 
the most significant reasons for the increase in sg a expense in  as compared with  was related to employee compensation costs to support the increase in sales activity and future initiatives million and increased employee incentives due to improved operating performance in million 
other this unit includes the delta grinding media and electrolytic manganese operations and our industrial tubing and fasteners operations 
the increase in sales in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due improved sales volumes in all of these operations and currency translation effects approximately million 
fiscal operating income improved due to the full year effect of the delta operations  improved operating results in the manganese dioxide and tubing operations and currency translation approximately million 
net corporate expense net corporate expense in fiscal was comparable to corporate expenses decreased in fiscal  as compared with  due to delta acquisition and integration costs that were incurred in million but not and lower deferred compensation expense million 
these decreases were offset somewhat by the full year effect of delta administration costs million and higher employee incentive expense associated with improved profitability in as compared with million and increased compensation expenses million 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows working capital and operating cash flows net working capital was  million at december   as compared with million at december  the increase in net working capital in mainly resulted from increased receivables and inventories to support the increase in sales 
operating cash flow was million in fiscal  as compared with million in fiscal the increase in operating cash flow in mainly was the result of the reduction in the non cash tax benefits associated with the delta ltd 
legal reorganization recorded as a reduction of income tax expense million in fiscal investing cash flows capital spending in fiscal was million  as compared with million in fiscal a significant portion of the capital spending million for was to expand our capacity for utility projects 
we expect our capital spending for the fiscal year to be 
table of contents approximately million 
the major sources of capital spending in fiscal will be additional production capacity in the irrigation and utility support structures segments 
of the million of planned capital spending  approximately relates to projects that have been approved 
investing cash flows for fiscal included million for the pure metal galvanizing acquisition 
financing cash flows our total interest bearing debt was flat at million as of december  and december  financing cash flows in included approximately million to acquire the remaining of the shares of donhad pty 
ltd 
sources of financing and capital we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
we have an internal long term objective to maintain long term debt as a percent of invested capital at or below 
at december   our long term debt to invested capital ratio was  as compared with at december  subject to our level of acquisition activity and steel industry operating conditions which could affect the levels of inventory we need to fulfill customer commitments  we plan to maintain this ratio below in our debt financing at december  consisted primarily of long term debt 
we also maintain certain short term bank lines of credit totaling million  million of which was unused at december  our long term debt principally consists of million face value million carrying value of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at per annum and are due in april we are allowed to repurchase the notes at specified prepayment premiums 
these notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
we may increase the credit facility by up to an additional million at any time  subject to participating banks increasing the amount of their lending commitments 
the interest rate on our borrowings will be  at our option  either a libor based on a   or month interest period  as selected by us plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda  or  b the higher of the higher of a the prime lending rate and b the federal funds rate plus basis points plus in each case  to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda  or libor based on a week interest period plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement has a termination date of august  and contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement 
at december   we had the ability to borrow million under this facility  after consideration of standby letters of credit of million associated with certain insurance obligations 
these debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities  including capital expenditures 
our key debt covenants are as follows interest bearing debt is not to exceed x ebitda of the prior four quarters  and ebitda over the prior four quarters must be at least x our interest expense over the same period 

table of contents at december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements 
the key covenant calculations at december  were as follows interest bearing debt ebitda last four quarters leverage ratio ebitda last four quarters interest expense last four quarters interest earned ratio the calculation of ebitda last four quarters is presented under the column for fiscal in footnote b to the table selected five year data in item selected financial data 
our businesses are cyclical  but we have diversity in our markets  from a product  customer and a geographical standpoint 
we have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity 
we have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures 
based on our available credit facilities  recent issuance of senior unsecured notes and our history of positive operational cash flows  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for fiscal and beyond 
we have not made any provision for us income taxes in our financial statements on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we intend to reinvest those earnings 
of our cash balances at december   million is held in entities outside the united states 
if we need to repatriate foreign cash balances to the united states to meet our cash needs  income taxes would be paid to the extent that those cash repatriations were undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the income taxes that we would pay if cash were repatriated depends on the amounts to be repatriated and from which country 
if all of our cash outside the united states were to be repatriated to the united states  we estimate that we would pay approximately million in income taxes to repatriate that cash 
financial obligations and financial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  delta pension plan contributions  operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations at december  were as follows in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt interest delta pension plan contributions operating leases unconditional purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations long term debt mainly consisted of million principal amount of senior unsecured notes 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our bank revolving credit agreement 
obligations under these agreements may be accelerated in event of non compliance with debt covenants 
the delta pension plan contributions are related to estimated cash funding commitments to the plan with the plan trustees  which are currently being negotiated in conjunction with a triennial valuation 
operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business 

table of contents unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for zinc  aluminum and steel  all of which we plan to use in  and certain capital investments planned for we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
at december   we had approximately million of various long term liabilities related to certain income tax  environmental and other matters 
these items are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 
market risk changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
over the last several years  prices for these commodities have been volatile 
the volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply and demand conditions  government tariffs and the costs of steel making inputs 
we have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years 
our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible 
we use natural gas swap contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures except as described below  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates our interest bearing debt at december  was mostly fixed rate debt 
our notes payable and a small portion of our long term debt accrue interest at a variable rate 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have affected our interest expense in and by approximately million and million  respectively 
likewise  we have excess cash balances on deposit in interest bearing accounts in financial institutions 
an increase or decrease in interest rates of ten basis points would have impacted our annual interest earnings in by approximately million 
foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are not material 
from time to time  as market conditions indicate  we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with anticipated future transactions and current balance sheet positions that are in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations 
at december   there were no significant open foreign currency contracts 
much of our cash in non us entities is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million in and million in 
table of contents we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our most significant investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions australian dollar chinese renminbi canadian dollar euro brazilian real uk pound commodity risk natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories  especially in our coatings segment galvanizing operations  where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot dipped galvanizing process 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for of our us natural gas requirements for the upcoming months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on nymex futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged 
the objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden  significant increases in the price of natural gas 
at december   we have open natural gas swaps for  mmbtu 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history customer financial information reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customer financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impaired ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is 
table of contents recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs costs for replacement parts other direct costs associated with warranty claims the number of product units subject to warranty claims in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumptions in our estimates are the rates we apply to those recent sales which is based on historical claims experience and our expected future warranty costs for products that are covered under warranty for an extended period of time 
our provision for various product warranties was approximately million at december  if our estimate changed by  the impact on operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value approximately of our inventory 
the remaining of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
conversely  in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in  we experienced lower costs to produce inventory than in the prior year  due mainly to lower cost for steel and steel related products 
this resulted in lower cost of goods sold and higher operating income in of approximately million  than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
in and  we experienced higher costs compared to previous years and operating income was lower by approximately million and million  respectively  than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional inventory write downs may be required 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from to years 
we identified eleven reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill and we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which usually coincides with our strategic planning process 
we assess the value of our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenses discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the projected cash flows 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under current accounting standards  we rely on our previous valuations 
table of contents for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
the valuation of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values 
accordingly  no further valuation of our reporting units was necessary 
if our assumptions on discount rates and future cash flows change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe these assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
our reporting units are all cyclical and their sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year 
in the evaluation of our reporting units  we look at the long term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value  which requires management judgment 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names 
we assess the values of these assets apart from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing 
we use the relief from royalty method to evaluate our trade names  under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against estimated future sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value 
the most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales  the royalty rate and the after tax discount rate 
for our evaluation purposes  the royalty rates used vary between and of sales and the after tax discount rate of to  which we estimate to be the after tax cost of capital for such assets 
the company trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of and the company determined that the value of its trade names were not impaired 
in  the company determined the pirod and industrial galvanizers of america trade names were impaired 
the evaluations of these trade names were completed in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a write down of million 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income expectations and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made 
likewise  if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets relating mainly to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  with a valuation allowance of million 
as a result of a legal entity restructuring within the delta group in fiscal  we released of a portion of valuation allowances previously established 
prior to the legal entity restructuring  because these tax losses were generated in the uk and delta had no operations or future income taxable in the uk  delta historically did not establish a value on its financial statements for deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses and book and tax basis differences in its pension plan liability 
also  at december   million in valuation allowances remain in the delta entities related to capital loss carryforwards  which are unlikely ever to be realized 
if circumstances related to our deferred tax assets change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income 

table of contents during we recorded million in income tax expense on million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which we determined are not permanently invested 
foreign subsidiaries not considered permanently invested had total cash of million at december  we have not made any us income tax provision in our financial statements for million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we intend to reinvest those earnings 
foreign subsidiaries considered permanently invested had total cash of million at december  if circumstances change and we determine that we are not permanently invested  we would need to record an income tax expense on our financial statements for the resulting income tax that would be paid upon repatriation 
the amount of that income tax would depend on how much of those earnings were repatriated but could range from a low of million to a high of million 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate 
the tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues 
we include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies 
if our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience  our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period 
pension benefits delta ltd 
maintains a defined benefit pension plan for qualifying employees in the united kingdom 
there are no active employees as members in the plan 
independent actuaries assist in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with accounting for pension benefits to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses  we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually 
key assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on the yields available on aa rated corporate bonds with durational periods similar to that of the pension liabilities 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
most of the assets in the pension plan are invested in corporate bonds  the expected return of which are estimated based on the yield available on aa rated corporate bonds 
the long term expected returns on equities are based on historic performance over the long term 
inflation is based on the estimated change in the consumer price index cpi or the retail price index rpi  depending on the relevant plan provisions 
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension expense for and the estimated impact on pension expense relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension discount rate expected return on plan assets inflation cpi inflation rpi
