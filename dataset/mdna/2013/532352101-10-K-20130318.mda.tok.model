item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are principally engaged in the production of copper replacement products which include refined copper products  copper wire produced from refined scrap copper and cca wire 
we manufacture and sell four major types of refined copper products and copper alternative products copper anode  pure copper rod  pure copper wire and cca wire 
copper anode  pure copper rod and pure copper wire products are produced from refined scrap copper utilizing our proprietary scrap copper recycling technology and process 
in the first quarter of  with the completion of a  ton per annum capacity smelter  we introduced a new production process and product line which enables us to produce pure copper products from scrap copper 
the new production process involves the fire refining of bulk recycled copper into high purity  low oxygen content copper rods also known as fire refined high conductivity rods 
we then either sell these large diameter mm copper rods into a range of markets  or further process these rods into much smaller diameter eg  mm copper wire also known as superfine copper wire 
we believe this recycled superfine copper wire is generally a more cost effective product for our customers  compared with pure copper wire manufactured from newly mined copper 
we launched production of copper anode in july  in conjunction with the completion of our second scrap copper smelter  with an initial annual capacity of  tons 
in october  we completed an efficiency upgrade of the smelters and increased the copper anode smelting capacity to  tons per annum  and the copper rod smelting capacity to  tons per annum 
in june  we completed construction of  and began production on  two copper anode smelters  each with   tons of annual production capacity 
in december  in order to consolidate physical production of copper anode  we dismantled the original copper anode smelter  which was at an older plant  and in january completed construction of a third copper anode smelter at the new copper anode production site 
in january  we began construction of the fourth anode smelter at the new site and expect it to be completed in the second quarter of copper anode is the fundamental building block for almost all pure copper products  and holds a wide range of potential end market uses 
we believe that our pricing advantage on our refined copper products can be maintained regardless of fluctuations in the commodity price of copper 
we believe we were among the first manufacturers to commercialize cca superfine wire production in china 
currently we have three different cca products cca fine wire  cca magnet wire and cca tin plated wire 
cca fine wire is the raw material for cca magnet wire and cca tin plated wire 
in the case of cca magnet wire  we coat the cca fine wire with a special magnetic coating  while in the case of cca tin plated wire  we plate the cca fine wire with a very thin layer of tin 
the value added nature of our cca superfine wire products lies in our ability and technology to draw down from much larger diameter cca raw wire  and further process it to produce super fine cca magnet wire and cca tin plated wire 
as a result  cca magnet wire and cca tin plated wire command higher market prices and higher gross margins than plain cca fine wire 
we draw pure copper wire from the refined pure copper rod we produce 
the pure copper wire we produce has three main sub categories of products fine wire  magnet wire and tin plated wire 
these three copper wire products have the similar characteristics as the three cca wire products mentioned above 
we have expanded our business from the cca superfine wire segment into the scrap copper refinery business because we believe that the scrap copper refinery business allows us to sell into the much bigger pure copper products market and offers us the ability to grow more rapidly while utilizing the proprietary equipment and technology that we possess relating to both the scrap copper cleaning as well as superfine wire drawing 
we believe that the ability to sell into the large and growing copper and copper replacement products market in china offers us substantial opportunity to increase our sales in the future 
we anticipate that we will continue to expand production capacity in both refined copper products and cca wire  but that the majority of our investment and resulting planned growth in sales volume will occur in the refined copper products business  which caters to a much bigger pure copper products market  compared with the cca wire market 
we sell our products primarily in china  either through distributors or directly to users  including distributors in the wire and cable industries and copper conglomerates as well as manufacturers in the consumer electronics  white goods  automotive  utility  telecommunications and specialty cable industries 
our market for copper anode is very large and diverse as copper anode is the raw material for copper cathode  which in turn is the foundation for most pure copper products 
for our other three main product categories copper rod  copper wire and cca wire  our markets overlap to a degree  and are characterized by their breadth and depth  with a very large number of current and potential customers for each product category 
copper rod is a raw material used in wire and cable production 
our refined copper products copper anode  copper rod and copper wire  which are manufactured from recycled scrap copper  compete directly with copper products made from virgin eg newly mined copper 
to date  our raw material costs for bulk scrap copper have been lower than prices for virgin copper  which provides us with a pricing advantage in the market for the refined copper products we produce from scrap copper 
during  we sold copper anode to a few large copper cathode manufacturers  which use our product to produce copper cathode 
we sold copper rod to customers which are mostly producers of smaller diameter copper wire used in power cables ranging in size from high voltage power transmission cables to white good applications such as internal wiring in household appliances and consumer electronics 
our copper wire  which is sold in a variety of diameters and may have undergone further in line processing such as coating with plastic  is sold to many of the same types of end use customers who purchase copper wire from our copper rod customers 
these include manufacturers of a wide range of power cables and products that incorporate wiring  such as household appliances  automobiles  consumer electronics and telecommunications equipment 
our cca wire is sold to many of these manufacturers also 
cca wire sells at a lower cost per unit of weight than pure copper wire  due to the relatively lower density of the aluminum core which makes up most of the volume of cca wire 
our cca wire offers conductivity performance characteristics that are only marginally below those of pure copper wire  which means they are attractive in a wide variety of product applications where a slight reduction in conductivity standards is tolerable such as most of the household appliance  automotive  consumer electronics and telecommunications applications 
examples of relatively high tolerance product applications where our cca wire would not provide an acceptable replacement option for pure copper wire would be military space equipment and wiring in nuclear power plants 
one low tolerance product category that requires pure copper wire rather than our less costly cca wire is electric motors  which require pure copper wire windings 
the markets for each of our product lines are growing rapidly  due both to growing demand in china for copper products including all types of basic wire raw materials and the relative cost advantages our product lines carry over virgin pure copper competitor products 
we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capture further market share in the copper and replacement product industry 
our refined copper products produced from recycled copper and cca wire are increasingly being accepted as cheaper alternatives to pure copper products 
as a result  our sales and net income have increased substantially during the last three years 
we generated sales of million  million and million for the years ended december  and and  respectively 
we achieved net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in and  we had non cash gain of million and non cash charge of million  respectively  which resulted from the extinguishment and the change in the fair value of the warrants issued to investors in conjunction with our issuance of convertible preferred stock in october excluding the impact of these non cash charges  net income for and were million and million  respectively  up and  respectively  from the prior year 
in  we had a non cash charge of million  which resulted from extinguishment and the change in the fair value of the warrants 
excluding the impact of these non cash gains  net income for was million  up from the prior year 
our capacity to sell our copper anode  copper rod  recycled copper wire products drawn from copper rod and cca wire products drawn from larger diameter cca wire is limited by the number and capacity of the equipment we have installed to produce these products 
our copper anode and copper rod are made from bulk scrap copper  which is cleaned  purified and smelted in large capacity smelter units 
at the present time we have four smelting facilities allocated to copper rod and copper anode production 
the three copper anode smelters are capable of producing   tons per year and the copper rod smelter is capable of producing  tons per year 
in  we sold  tons of copper anode and  tons of copper rod and wire 
as of december   we operated approximately high speed wire drawing machines  which draw larger diameter copper rod or cca rod into much finer diameter wires  with a total capacity of approximately   tons per annum of cca wire and approximately   tons per annum of mm mm diameter range copper wire 
the above referenced copper wire production capacity does not include the production of the thickest class of copper wire we produce  that with a diameter range of mm mm 
in  we sold  tons of cca wire 
certain of these drawing machines incorporate additional production steps such as coating  annealing or magnetizing the fine wire produced 
these drawing machines are manufactured to our design and specifications by custom equipment manufacturers located in china 
we are not dependent on any single custom equipment manufacturer for the fabrication of our drawing lines 
in the first half of  we added six high capacity copper wire drawing production lines  all of which are used to draw copper wire from our copper rod  and increased our annual capacity to   tons of mm mm diameter range copper wire 
in the third quarter of  we built our first copper anode smelter with  tons of annual capacity and started copper anode production 
in october we increased the production efficiency and capacity of the copper rod smelter and increased the smelting capacity to  tons 
as a result  the copper rod production capacity is more than that for superfine copper wire and we are expecting to see some copper rod sales in the sales mix going forward  should we produce more copper rod than the copper wire drawing capacity can absorb as raw material 
on the new plant construction site  we have added three copper anode smelters with   tons of annual capacity each  with the construction of the fourth anode smelter expected to be completed in the second quarter the original smelter with a smelting capacity of  tons was dismantled in december historically  we have taken a conservative approach in estimating the annual capacity of each main product category 
specifically  in the wire product categories cca and copper wire  our historical total annual capacity estimate was based upon the capacity assumption on drawing the thinnest superfine wire  even though we often produced and sold larger millimeters of wire 
since drawing the thinnest diameter of superfine wire ie mm takes the longest time  the estimated annual capacity that we have disclosed assumes only the smallest possible wire production capacity that we could attain 
we produce and sell a wide variety of superfine cca and copper wire products according to customer order specifications 
in  the average cca and copper wire diameters we produced and sold were in the range of mm to mm 
as a result  the actual sales volume of these two products exceeded our estimated production capacity  since such estimate is based upon the thinnest wire diameter production 
we are capable of producing annual production capacities for cca and copper wire in the range of   tons and   tons in the thickness range of mm mm  respectively 
this capacity estimate does not include the drawing capabilities of the thickest copper wire in the range of mm mm 
given the production capacity estimates are conservative based upon the assumptions that are used  as described above  management does not expect the current cca and copper wire capacity to limit potential sales 
however  such analysis and determination will be performed by us regularly in future years and any changes will be timely disclosed 
currently we do not have plans to expand the production capacity for the existing cca and copper wire products 
we have completed the construction of three new smelters with   tons of capacity each 
we have completed the research and development of new products in the cca cable and wire category  and have passed sample product quality testing 
we are actively seeking potential customers while planning to add capacity for the new products 
currently we are planning to launch this new product in the next to months 
the timing of this launch is dependent on various factors  including but not limited to receipt of new customer product qualification and orders  our capital investment plan  as well as working capital needs 
significant factors affecting our results of operations the most significant factors that affect our financial condition and results of operations are product mix and implications on gross margins  supply and costs of principal raw materials  copper prices and supply and demand of copper  production capacity  and economic conditions in china  product mix and effect on gross margins our gross margin is affected by our product mix 
we produce and sell products according to customer orders 
in our wire products pure copper wire and cca wire  magnet wire and tin plated wire are final products from which we will derive the highest production markup  or gross profit 
we also generate a significant portion of revenue from selling semi finished products such as fine wire at a lower production cost markup  or gross profit 
generally  copper anode and copper rod products contribute a lower gross profit margin compared to the wire products 
however  given the quick turnover and large volume production of the refined copper products  as well as primarily cash on delivery payment terms with our customers  the return on invested capital for the refined copper products and working capital turnover are much better than that of the wire products 
supply and costs of principal raw materials our ability to manage our operating costs depends significantly on our ability to secure affordable and reliable supplies of raw materials 
we have been able to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials  which consist primarily of scrap copper and cca raw material wire 
the price of our primary raw materials varies with reference to copper prices  and changes in copper price affect our cost of sales 
however  we are able to price our copper and cca products based on our material procurement costs plus a fixed dollar mark up  which is essentially our gross profit 
therefore  despite the implications of copper price movement on our gross and net profit margin figures  during the past three years the mark up  or our gross and net profit in absolute dollars  have not been materially affected by the change in copper prices 
copper prices and supply and demand of copper generally the price of our products is set at a certain discount to local retail copper prices  and we believe our products replace or supplement copper 
for these reasons  our products are affected by the market price  demand and supply of copper 
we price our refined copper and cca wire products based on the market price for materials plus a fixed dollar mark up  which is essentially our gross profit 
as copper prices rise  our fixed dollar mark up per ton processed represents a relatively lower percentage of our gross sales which is generally based on tons processed and therefore our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales is relatively lower  as copper prices decline  the inverse is true and we report relatively higher gross profit margins on a percentage basis 
despite the implications of copper price volatility on our gross and net profit margins in percentage terms  during the past three years the markup  or our gross and net profit in absolute dollar terms  has not been materially affected by the change of copper prices 
shanghai changjiang commodity market  one of the major metal trading markets in the prc  publishes the copper trading prices twice daily 
these prices typically set the range for the prices of our materials as well as finished products  and are generally followed by all industry participants 
production capacity in order to capture the market opportunity for our products  we have expanded  and plan to continue to expand  our production capacity 
increased capacity has had  and could continue to have  a significant effect on our results of operations  by allowing us to produce and sell more products to generate higher revenues and net income 
economic conditions in the prc we operate our manufacturing facilities in the prc and derive the majority of our revenues from sales to customers in the prc 
as such  economic conditions in the prc will affect virtually all aspects of our operations  including the demand for our products  the availability and prices of our raw materials and our other expenses 
the prc has experienced significant economic growth  achieving a cagr of in gross domestic product from through according to national bureau of statistics of china 
domestic demand for and consumption of copper and cca products has increased substantially as a result of this growth 
we believe that economic conditions in the prc will continue to affect our business and results of operations 
principal income statement components sales our sales are derived from sales of our products net of value added taxes 
the most significant factors that affect our sales are shipment volume and average selling prices 
our collection practices generally consist of cash payment on delivery 
however  we also extend credit for days to days to certain of our established customers in the cca wire category 
cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of direct material costs  and  to a lesser extent  direct labor costs and manufacturing overhead costs 
direct material costs generally accounted for the majority of our cost of sales 
gross profit our gross profit is affected primarily by the cost of raw materials  which is defined with reference to the cost of copper 
we are also able to price our products based on the market price for materials plus a fixed dollar mark up  which is essentially our gross profit 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling expenses include shipping expenses  salaries and traveling expenses for our sales personnel 
our general and administrative expenses include administrative staff costs and other benefits  depreciation of office equipment  professional service fees and other miscellaneous expenses related to our administrative corporate activities 
our sales activities are conducted through direct selling by our internal sales staff 
because of the strong demand for our products  we have not had to start to aggressively market and distribute our products  and our selling expenses have been relatively small as a percentage of our revenues 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase with the anticipated growth of our business and continued upgrades to our information technology infrastructure 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will also increase as a result of compliance  investor relations and other expenses associated with being a publicly listed company 
other income and expense other income and expense includes interest income  interest expense  merger costs  foreign currency translation adjustments  and other income 
our interest expense consists of expenses related to our short term bank borrowings 
we expense all interest as it is incurred 
change in fair value of warrants the fair value of the company s issued and outstanding series b warrants  and the warrants issued to placement agents in conjunction with the company s initial public offering in september  decreased to  as of december  and the company recognized a  loss  which is a non cash loss from the change in fair value of these warrants for the year ended december  in future periods  we may experience significant gains or losses  as the value of these warrants fluctuates in response to changes in our stock price 
income taxes under the current laws of the cayman islands and british virgin islands  we are not subject to any income or capital gains tax  and dividend payments we make are not subject to any withholding tax in the cayman islands or british virgin islands 
under the current laws of hong kong  we are not subject to any income or capital gains tax and dividend payments we make are not subject to any withholding tax in hong kong 
the prc new tax law imposes a withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside the prc for distribution of earnings generated after january  under the new tax law  the distribution of earnings generated prior to january  is exempt from the withholding tax 
as our subsidiaries in the prc will not be distributing their earnings to the company for the years ended december   and to the company  no deferred tax liability has been recognized for the undistributed earnings of these prc subsidiaries through december  total undistributed earnings of these prc subsidiaries at december  were rmb  
our two operating subsidiaries are governed by the prc income tax laws and are subject to the prc enterprise income tax eit 
each of the two entities files its own separate tax return 
according to the relevant laws and regulations in the prc  foreign invested enterprises established prior to january  were entitled to full exemption from income tax for two years beginning from the first year when enterprises become profitable and have accumulative profits and a income tax reduction for the subsequent three years 
being converted into a sino foreign joint equity enterprise in  lihua electron was thus entitled to the eit exemption in and  and has been subject to the income tax reduction for the period from to set out in the following table are the eit rates for our two prc operating companies from to lihua electron lihua copper results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales our business for the year ended december  continued to demonstrate solid growth 
net sales increased by from million in to million in this growth was primarily driven by increased sales of all of our products as a result of capacity addition 
the sales growth was partially offset by the decrease in average sales price in comparing to please see the table below for more details regarding the product sales breakdown by specific category 
year ended december  in thousands  except for percentage and average price sales volume mt average price sales volume mt average price cca and copper wire     copper anode     copper rod      total      the overall sales volume increase of in over is the result of additional production from two new smelters added in june sales volume of cca and copper wire in has grown from fiscal year as a result of copper rod smelter annual capacity increase to  ton in october sales volume of copper anode in has grown from primarily as a result of the additional production from two new copper anode smelters which we completed construction and started production in june of the year over year copper rod sales volume increase was the result of full year of increased copper rod capacity production in after the october rod smelter capacity expansion 
we sell our products based on the prevailing market price at the time of the sale 
factors impacting average selling prices of our products are copper price fluctuation  and in the case of the wire products  the average diameter of the wire products we sold during the period the thicker the wire diameter the lower the sale price  and vice versa 
cost of sales and gross margin the following table sets forth our cost of sales and gross profit  both in amounts and as a percentage of total sales for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands  except for percentage cost of sales of sales cost of sales of sales cca and copper wire   copper anode   copper rod   total   year ended december  in thousands  except for percentage gross profit of sales gross profit of sales cca and copper wire   copper anode   copper rod  total   percentage of sales of respective product category average gross profit margin decreased to in as compared to in  primarily as a result of increased copper anode and copper rod sales in the product mix 
our refined copper products typically are the lower profitable products when comparing with the wire products 
since copper wire is a lower gross margin product than cca wire  the increase in copper wire sales also contributed to the decrease in average cca and copper wire gross margin as well as overall gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth operating expenses and income from operations both in amounts and as a percentage of total sales for selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and year ended december  change in year ended december  compared to year ended december  in thousands  except for percentage us of sales us of sales gross profit   operating expenses selling expenses   general administrative expenses   total operating expense   income from operations   total selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period last year  an increase of 
selling expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of compared to the same period last year 
the increase was attributable to increased costs related to product distribution and insurance as a result of expanded business volume  and increased staffing costs as we continued to expand the sales force during the period 
included in selling expenses were shipping and handling costs of million and million in and  respectively  representing an increase of  while tons of products sold by us increased compared to tons of cca and copper wire and rod products sold increased in the slower growth in shipping and handling costs comparing to the sales volume growth of our products is due to i copper anode sales have only been made to two customers  both of whom are located in cities that are within close proximity to our production location 
our wire and rod products are mostly sold to customers located geographically close to us as well  ii depending on our negotiation with customers on a case by case basis  shipping and handling costs for our products may either be borne by us or by our customers  iii we own a small fleet of trucks to handle part of the shipping and handling of our products which provides further cost savings compared to outsourcing 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of compared to the same period last year 
the main factors which caused this increase were i higher staff costs associated with our expanded scale of operations  and ii higher research and development costs as we have completed r d for new cca products and developed r d partnerships with shanghai electric cable research institute and beijing modern recycling economy research institute in interest expense interest expense was none for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period last year

year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales our business for the year ended december  continued to demonstrate robust growth 
net sales increased by from million in to million in this growth was primarily driven by i strong market demand for our cca and copper wire products  ii the launch of the new smelting capacity in the third quarter of  which operated a full year in and allowed us to keep up with increased product demand  iii the further increase in the smelting capacity in october  and iv the increase of copper prices during relative to please see the table below for more details regarding the product sales breakdown by specific category 
year ended december  in thousands  except for percentage and average price sales volume mt average price sales volume mt average price cca and copper wire     copper anode     copper rod      total      the overall sales volume increase of in over is the result of additional production volume in our existing products in as a result of the capacity addition incurred throughout in both our wire products and copper anode product  and smelting capacity expansion in october  partially offset by the reduction in copper rod sales as a result of increased use of rod internally as raw material for copper wire 
sales volume of cca and copper wire in has grown from fiscal year as a result of wire drawing capacity expansion in the first half of we added six new copper wire drawing production lines in the first half of and thus expanded copper wire production capacity from  tons expanded in october per annum to   tons per annum  for production of the wires in the thickness range of mm mm 
we began production and sales of copper anode in august  and sold  tons and  tons of copper anode in and  respectively 
since we expanded our copper wire production capacity in the first half of  beginning in the third quarter of  we nearly fully utilized all copper rod produced for internal copper wire production  thereafter greatly reduced the sales volume of copper rod to outside customers 
with the copper rod production capacity increase in october  we began sales of copper rod since fourth quarter of we sell our products based on the prevailing market price at the time of the sale 
factors impacting average selling prices of our products are copper price fluctuation  and in the case of the wire products  the average diameter of the wire products we sold during the period the thicker the wire diameter the lower the sale price  and vice versa

due to their proximity to our facilities  the costs of shipping and handling for copper anode sales were significantly less than the costs of sales for our other products to customers that are located further from our facility 
depending on customer s requests on a case by case basis  shipping and handling costs for our products may either be borne by us or by our customers 
the greater percentage increase in shipping and handling costs compared to the percentage increase in tons of products of wire and rod products sold during was attributable to more customers requesting us to bear these costs compared to last year

the additional capital expenditures for the remaining infrastructure for the new smelting facilities  planned capacity addition of the new cca cable and wire products  as well as the completion of the construction of the entire new plant site  are estimated to be million 
as a result of expanded production capacity following the completion of the new plant  the company had higher sales  higher depreciation and other operating costs  and an overall increase in net income in the year and expects this trend to continue in future years

the company has purchased  shares in the open market at aggregate cost of million 
the initial repurchases were funded with us dollars the company had in its hong kong bank account  and the subsequent repurchases were funded by an aggregate of million loans  denominated in us dollars  from magnify wealth 
the company repaid magnify wealth in full  in rmb 
while the company s operating subsidiaries in the prc have substantial cash reserves available  the laws of the prc restrict the conversion of rmb to us dollars  such that the company has encountered difficulty funding the repurchase program with us dollars from cash held by its prc subsidiaries 
the company explored possible alternative arrangements for funding the repurchase program in us dollars with financial institutions  but company management determined that such alternatives would have been costly or otherwise not appropriate for the company 
the repurchase program expired in january on january and march   in order to partially fund the special dividend payment and operating expenses  magnify wealth loaned million and million respectively under the note  of which rmb million and rmb million were repaid on january and march   respectively  in rmb  at the average rate of rmb per us dollars  which was based upon the exchange rate between us dollars and rmb as set forth by standard chartered bank in hong kong

the loans under the note were unsecured  payable on demand and bore interest at per annum 
as of december   there were no outstanding loans under the note 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures are principally directed for expansion of production facilities  including construction and purchases of property  plant and equipment 
in  and  we funded our capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operating activities and the proceeds of bank borrowings  and equity issuance 
in  as we accelerate our expansion  we expect continued capital expenditures for maintaining existing machines and adding manufacturing equipment in our mu new plant site  which is adjacent to our existing plant 
we currently have four smelting facilities which can produce a total of   tons of refined copper products per year 
since  we have added  tons of new anode smelting capacity  while dismantling an older anode smelter with  tons of annual capacity 
with our current capacity of production lines  we can produce   tons of cca wire and   tons of copper wire with the diameter range of mm mm 
we have completed the research and development of a new cca cable and wire product and are in the process of completing production license applications before capacity additions for the new product on our new plant site 
at the present time we estimate that this new product will be launched in to months 
construction of the entire mu approximately acres new plant site is anticipated to be completed in year the estimated additional capital spending for the potential production equipment for the new cca cable and wire product and the construction of the remaining site  is approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs to bring all of our facilities into full production 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
accounts receivable in  we sold  tons of cca and copper wire   tons of copper anode and  tons of copper rod 
in  we sold  tons of cca and copper wire   tons of copper anode and  tons of copper rod 
as cca is an emerging product in the prc  lihua extends credit terms to some of its larger customers 
however  pure copper products  such as our copper anode  copper rod and copper wire  are in such high demand that we don t have to extend credit terms 
our customers often purchase more than one type of product from us for example  one customer may purchase both cca wire and copper wire 
cca wire purchases are generally accorded to day payment terms  depending upon the creditworthiness of the customer  while the copper wire and copper rod and anode purchases are payable upon delivery to the customer  which may occur two to seven days after we ship the product and recognize our revenue 
this decision to extend terms or to collect payment upon receipt essentially a cash sale  although due to the shipping time this effectively becomes a very short receivable  is based primarily upon the product type 
we may extend terms for cca purchases to a credit worthy customer  but for that same customer require payment upon delivery for purchases of copper anode  rod and or copper wire 
the table below shows the breakdown of accounts receivable by products as of december  cca wire and copper wire   copper anode   copper rod   total   off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk substantially all of our revenues and expenditures are denominated in renminbi 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollars and renminbi will affect our financial results in us dollars terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations 
the renminbi s exchange rate with the us dollar and other currencies is affected by  among other things  changes in the prc s political and economic conditions 
the exchange rate for conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies is heavily influenced by intervention in the foreign exchange market by the people s bank of china 
from to july  the people s bank of china intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an exchange rate of approximately renminbi per us dollar 
on july   the prc government changed this policy and began allowing modest appreciation of the renminbi versus the us dollar 
however  the renminbi is restricted to a rise or fall of no more than per day versus the us dollar  and the people s bank of china continues to intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate 
nevertheless  under china s current exchange rate regime  the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term 
there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy  which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the renminbi against the us dollar 
any devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar would consequently have an adverse effect on our financial performance and asset values when measured in terms of us dollars 
on the other hand  the appreciation of the renminbi could make our customers products more expensive to purchase because many of our customers are involved in the export of goods  which may have an adverse impact on their sales 
a decrease in sales by our customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  as of december  and  we had cash denominated in renminbi and us dollar amounting to rmb million million and rmb million million  respectively 
we recognized a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately rmb million million for the year ended december very limited hedging transactions are available in the prc to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
in addition  our currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert renminbi into foreign currency 
interest rate risk should we incur short term bank borrowings  we may be exposed to interest rate risk arising from short term variable rate borrowings from time to time 
our future interest expense will fluctuate in line with any change in our borrowing rates 
we believe our exposure to interest rate risk and other relevant market risks is not material 
we did not have short term bank borrowing outstanding as of december  however  we may incur short term bank borrowings under our working capital revolving line of credit from time to time 
inflation in recent years  the prc has experienced more material inflation  however inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in consumer price index in china was   and in   and  respectively
