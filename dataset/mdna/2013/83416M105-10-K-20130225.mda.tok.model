overview solar senior capital ltd  a maryland corporation formed in december  is a closed end  externally managed  non diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a bdc under the act 
in addition  for tax purposes we intend to elect to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
on february   we priced our ipo  selling million shares  including the underwriters over allotment  at a price of per share 
concurrent with this offering  management purchased an additional  shares through a concurrent private placement  also at per share 
on august   we established the million credit facility with citigroup global markets inc acting as administrative agent 
in connection with the credit facility  our wholly owned subsidiary  suns spv llc was formed 
the credit facility was originally scheduled to mature on august  and generally bore interest at a rate of libor plus 
the credit facility has million available with an additional million available as a delayed draw 
it can also be expanded up to million 
the credit facility is secured by all of the assets held by the spv 
under the terms of the credit facility  solar senior and the spv  as applicable  have made certain customary representations and warranties  and are required to comply with various covenants  
table of contents including leverage restrictions  reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities 
the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature 
on november   we amended our million credit facility 
as a result of the amendment  the stated interest rate on the credit facility was reduced to libor plus from libor plus  and the credit facility continues to have no libor floor requirement 
in addition  the amendment reduced certain non usage fees 
the amendment also provided us greater flexibility and extended the final maturity date to november  we invest primarily in us middle market companies  where we believe the supply of primary capital is limited and the investment opportunities are most attractive 
our investment objective is to seek to maximize current income consistent with the preservation of capital 
we seek to achieve our investment objective by investing primarily in senior loans  including first lien  uni tranche  and second lien debt instruments  made to private middle market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade  which we refer to collectively as senior loans 
we may also invest in debt of public companies that are thinly traded 
under normal market conditions  at least of the value of our net assets including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes will be invested in senior loans 
senior loans typically pay interest at rates which are determined periodically on the basis of a floating base lending rate  primarily libor  plus a premium 
senior loans in which we expect to invest are typically made to us and  to a limited extent  non us corporations  partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions 
senior loans typically are rated below investment grade 
securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans or high yield securities  and may be considered high risk compared to debt instruments that are rated investment grade 
we expect to invest in senior loans made primarily to private leveraged middle market companies with approximately million to million of ebitda 
our business model is focused primarily on the direct origination of investments through portfolio companies or their financial sponsors 
we expect that our investments will generally range between million and million each  although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base 
in addition  we may invest a portion of our portfolio in other types of investments  which we refer to as opportunistic investments  which are not our primary focus but are intended to enhance our overall returns 
these opportunistic investments may include  but are not limited to  direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of the united states 
we may invest up to of our total assets in such opportunistic investments  including senior loans issued by non us issuers  subject to compliance with our regulatory obligations as a bdc under the act

as a business development company  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies 
pursuant to rules adopted in  the sec expanded the definition of eligible portfolio company to include certain public companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange 
the sec also adopted an additional rule under the act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company to include companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than million 
this rule became effective on july  revenue we generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income from the securities we hold and capital gains  if any  on investment securities that we may sell 
our debt investments generally have a stated term of three to seven years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  commercial paper rate  or the prime rate 
interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly but may be monthly or semi annually 
in addition  our investments may provide pik interest 
such amounts of accrued pik interest are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer 
we may also generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and  if applicable  consulting fees  etc

we expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase moderately in dollar terms 
during periods of asset growth  we generally expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines 
incentive fees  interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities  among others  may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance  interest rate benchmarks  and offerings of our securities relative to comparative periods  among other factors

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following items as critical accounting policies 
valuation of portfolio investments we conduct the valuation of our assets  pursuant to which our net asset value is determined  at all times consistent with gaap  and the act 
our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the closing price on the valuation date 
we may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets 
when doing so  we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to gaap to determine the fair value of the security 
if determined adequate  we use the quote obtained 
securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing sources do not provide a valuation or methodology  or provide a valuation or methodology that does not represent fair value in the judgment of solar capital partners or our board of directors  shall be valued as follows i each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment  ii preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with senior management  iii independent third party valuation firms engaged by  or on behalf of  the board of directors will conduct independent appraisals and review management s preliminary valuations and make their own assessment for a each portfolio investment that  when taken together with all other investments in the same portfolio company  exceeds of total assets  plus available borrowings  as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter  and b each portfolio investment that is presently in default  iv the board of directors will discuss valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the investment adviser and  where appropriate  the respective third party valuation firms 
the recommendation of fair value will generally consider the following factors among others  as relevant the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  the portfolio company s earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the issuer does business  and comparisons to publicly traded securities 
securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which a pricing source is not sufficient may include  but are not limited to  the following private placements and restricted securities that do not have an active trading market  
table of contents securities whose trading has been suspended or for which market quotes are no longer available  debt securities that have recently gone into default and for which there is no current market  securities whose prices are stale  securities affected by significant events  and securities that the investment adviser believes were priced incorrectly 
determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates 
accordingly  the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations  and any change in such valuations  on our consolidated financial statements 
level financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the company has the ability to access examples include active exchange traded equity securities and exchange traded derivatives 
level financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level inputs include the following a quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  b quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets  c pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  and d pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these inputs reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability and long dated or complex derivatives 
valuation of credit facility the company has made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option of accounting to the credit facility  in accordance with asc we believe accounting for the credit facility at fair value will better align the measurement methodologies of assets and liabilities  which may mitigate certain earnings volatility 
as a result of this election  approximately million of costs related to the establishment of the original credit facility was expensed during the period january  commencement of operations to december   and approximately million was expensed during the year ended december  related to the amendment  rather than being deferred and amortized over the life of the credit facility 
revenue recognition the company records interest and dividend income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  on an accrual basis 
investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest and or dividends in cash are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest dividend cash payments are past due days or more and or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest dividend cash payments will be collected 
such non accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest or dividends are paid in cash  and in management s judgment  are likely to continue timely payment of their 
table of contents remaining interest or dividend obligations 
interest or dividend cash payments received on non accrual designated investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment 
some of our investments may have contractual payment in kind pik interest or dividends 
pik interest and dividends computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date 
pik investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities 
when additional securities are received  they typically have the same terms  including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued 
on these payment dates  the company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received 
pik generally becomes due at the maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer 
at the point the company believes pik is not expected to be realized  the pik investment will be placed on non accrual status 
when a pik investment is placed on non accrual status  the accrued  uncapitalized interest or dividends is reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income  respectively 
the company does not reverse previously capitalized pik interest or dividends 
upon capitalization  pik is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments 
pik investments on non accrual status are restored to accrual status if the company again believes that pik is expected to be realized 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the interest method or straight line  as applicable 
upon the prepayment of a loan  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts 
capital structuring fees are recorded as other income when earned 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we generally measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized origination or commitment fees and prepayment penalties 
the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
results of operations results comparisons are for the fiscal year ended december   and the period january  commencement of operations to december  investment income for the fiscal year ended december   and the period january  commencement of operations to december   gross investment income totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase in gross investment income from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the size of the income producing portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year combined with having a full fiscal year for as compared to a partial fiscal expenses expenses totaled million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   and the period january  commencement of operations to december   of which million and million  respectively  were base management fees and performance based incentive fees and million and million  respectively  were interest and other debt related expenses 
administrative 
table of contents services  insurance and other general and administrative expenses totaled million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   and the period january  commencement of operations to december  expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees  insurance expenses  administrative services fees  legal fees  directors fees  audit and tax services expenses  transfer agent fees  and other general and administrative expenses 
the increase in expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to a year that saw significant growth in our portfolio of assets and business in general  as compared to our partial first fiscal year of operations in net investment income the company s net investment income totaled million or per average share and million or per average share  for the fiscal year ended december  and the period january  commencement of operations to december   respectively 
net realized gains losses the company had investment sales and prepayments totaling million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended december   and the period january  commencement of operations to december  net realized gains losses for the fiscal year ended december   and the period january  commencement of operations to december  totaled million and million  respectively 
net realized gains for the fiscal year ended were primarily related to selected sales of assets such as genesys telecommunications  kik custom products  and sthi holdings 
net realized losses incurred in fiscal were primarily related to our investment in american airlines 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended december   and the period january  commencement of operations to december   net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on the company s assets and liabilities totaled million and million  respectively 
net unrealized appreciation for fiscal was primarily attributable to general market improvements  modest yield tightening and overall positive net changes in general portfolio company fundamentals 
during fiscal  unrealized depreciation was recorded primarily due to the general market dislocation and the then overall market expectations for pricing increased credit risk 
net increase decrease in net assets from operations for the fiscal year ended december   and the period january  commencement of operations to december   the company had a net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations of million and million  respectively

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity and capital resources are generally available through our senior secured million revolving credit facility  through periodic follow on equity offerings  as well as from cash flows from operations  investment sales and pre payments of investments 
at december   the company had million in borrowings outstanding on its credit facility and million of unused capacity 
on january   the company closed a follow on public equity offering of million shares of common stock at per share raising approximately million in net proceeds 
in the future  the company may raise additional equity or debt capital  among other considerations 
the primary use of funds will 
table of contents be investments in portfolio companies  reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes 
the issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions  funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful 
we expect that all current liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from operations  borrowings on our credit facility  and other activities 
cash equivalents we deem certain us treasury bills  repurchase agreements and other high quality  short term debt securities as cash equivalents 
from time to time  including at the end of each fiscal quarter  we consider using various treasury strategies for our business 
one strategy includes taking proactive steps by utilizing cash equivalents with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility during the following quarter pursuant to section of the act 
more specifically  we may purchase us treasury bills from time to time on the last business day of the quarter and typically close out that position on the following business day  settling the sale transaction on a net cash basis with the purchase  subsequent to quarter end 
we may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions  including drawing down on our credit facility  as deemed appropriate 
the amount of these transactions or such drawn cash for this purpose is excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the management fee is determined 
there were no cash equivalents held as of december  debt credit facility on august   we established the million credit facility with citigroup global markets inc acting as administrative agent 
in connection with the credit facility  the spv was formed 
the credit facility was originally scheduled to mature on august  and generally bore interest at a rate of libor plus 
the credit facility has million available with an additional million available as a delayed draw 
it can also be expanded up to million 
the credit facility is secured by all of the assets held by the spv 
under the terms of the credit facility  solar senior and the spv  as applicable  have made certain customary representations and warranties  and are required to comply with various covenants  including leverage restrictions  reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities 
the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature 
on november   we amended our million credit facility 
as a result of the amendment  the stated interest rate on the credit facility was reduced to libor plus from libor plus  and the credit facility continues to have no libor floor requirement 
in addition  the amendment reduced certain non usage fees 
the amendment also provided us greater flexibility and extended the final maturity date to november  at december   the company was in compliance with all financial and operational covenants required by the credit facility 
contractual obligations payments due by period as of december  dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years senior secured revolving credit facility at december   million remained unused 

table of contents information about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of each year ended december since the company commenced operations  unless otherwise noted 
the indicates information which the sec expressly does not require to be disclosed for certain types of senior securities 
class and year total amount outstanding dollars in thousands asset coverage per unit involuntary liquidating preference per unit average market value per unit revolving credit facility fiscal   n a fiscal   n a total amount of each class of senior securities outstanding at the end of the period presented 
the asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets  less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities  divided by senior securities representing indebtedness 
this asset coverage ratio is multiplied by  to determine the asset coverage per unit 
in order to determine the specific asset coverage per unit for each class of debt  the total asset coverage per unit was divided based on the amount outstanding at the end of the period for each 
the amount to which such class of senior security would be entitled upon the involuntary liquidation of the issuer in preference to any security junior to it 
not applicable  we do not have senior securities that are registered for public trading 
we have entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments the investment advisory and management agreement  pursuant to which solar capital partners has agreed to serve as our investment adviser  and the administration agreement  pursuant to which solar capital management has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day to day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance 
payments under the investment advisory and management agreement are equal to a percentage of the value of our average gross assets and a two part incentive fee 
payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of solar capital management s overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement  including rent  technology systems  insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs 
either party may terminate each of the investment advisory and management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon days written notice to the other 
off balance sheet arrangements none dividends and distributions dividends and distributions paid to stockholders for the fiscal years ended december  and totaled million or per share and million and per share  respectively 
tax characteristics of all dividends are reported to shareholders on form after the end of each calendar year 
our dividends  if any  will be determined by our board of directors 
we expect that our dividends and distributions to stockholders will generally be from accumulated net investment income and from net realized capital gains  if any  as applicable 

table of contents the following table summarizes our dividends to stockholders date declared record date payment date amount fiscal february  march  april  february  february  march  january  january  february  total fiscal december  december  january  november  november  december  october  october  november  september  september  october  july  august  september  july  july  august  june  june  july  may  may  june  april  april  may  february  march  april  february  february  march  january  january  february  total fiscal december  december  december  november  november  december  october  october  november  september  september  october  august  august  september  july  july  august  june  june  june  total we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
to maintain our ric status  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company  we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions 
also  our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax 
table of contents consequences  including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company 
in addition  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not received in cash  such as contractual payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term  or the accrual of original issue or market discount 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company 
with respect to the dividends to stockholders  income from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and certain other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are treated as taxable income and accordingly  distributed to stockholders 
related parties we have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties  including the following we have entered into an investment advisory and management agreement with solar capital partners 
mr 
gross  our chairman and chief executive officer  is the managing member and a senior investment professional of  and has financial and controlling interests in  solar capital partners

solar capital partners  our investment adviser  is the sole member of and controls solar capital management 
we have entered into a license agreement with solar capital partners  pursuant to which solar capital partners has granted us a non exclusive  royalty free license to use the name solar capital 
solar capital partners and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar  in whole and in part  with ours 
for example  solar capital partners presently serves as investment adviser to solar capital ltd  a publicly traded bdc  which to focuses on investing primarily in senior secured loans  mezzanine loans and equity securities

in such event  depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors  solar capital partners or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side by side with one or more other funds 
any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the sec and its staff  and consistent with solar capital partners allocation procedures 
in addition  we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our officers and directors 
our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the act and the maryland general corporation law 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended december   all but one of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans were primarily based on floating libor and typically have durations of one to three months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
most of our loans to portfolio companies have libor floors 
the company also has a revolving credit facility that is based on floating libor and commercial paper rates 
assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of december   a hypothetical one percent increase in libor on our floating rate assets and liabilities would decrease our earnings by approximately four cents per average share over the next twelve months 
assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of december   a hypothetical one quarter of one percent decrease in libor on our floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our earnings by approximately one cent per average share over the next twelve months 
however  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time to time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
increase decrease in libor increase decrease in net investment income per share per year
