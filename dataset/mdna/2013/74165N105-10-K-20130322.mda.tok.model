during  we committed to a plan to sell the assets related to the sparkling beverage appliances  flavor concentrates  co cylinders and accessories sold under the flavorstation brand and as a result  we are no longer reporting flavorstation as a separate business segment and current and prior year amounts and disclosures reflect these operations as discontinued operations 
industry overview we believe there are several trends that support consumer demand for our exchange and refill services and water dispensers including the following emphasis on health and wellness 
as part of a desire to live a healthier lifestyle  we believe consumers are increasingly focused on drinking greater quantities of water 
concerns regarding quality of municipal tap water 
many consumers purchase bottled water because of concerns regarding municipal tap water quality 
municipal water is typically surface water that is treated centrally and pumped to homes  which can allow chemical contaminants to dissolve into the water through municipal or household pipes impacting taste and quality and present microbiological contaminants from cracks in municipal pipes 
growing preference for purified water 
we believe consumer preference toward purified water relative to tap water continues to grow as purified water has become accepted on a mainstream basis 
while it is difficult to quantify purified water consumption in all of its forms  according to a report by industry consulting firm beverage marketing corp 
americans spent billion on bottled water in increasing demand for products with lower environmental impact 
we believe that consumers are increasingly favoring products with a lower environmental impact with a reuse  recycle  reduce mindset becoming a common driver of consumer behavior 
most single serve polyethylene terephthalate pet water bottles are produced using fossil fuels and contribute to landfill waste given that only of pet bottles are recycled according to a november environmental protection agency report 
governmental legislation also reflects these concerns with the passage of bottle bills in many jurisdictions that tax the purchase of plastic water bottles  require deposits with the purchase of certain plastic bottles  prohibit the use of government funds to purchase plastic water bottles and ban certain plastic bottles from landfills 
availability of an economical exchange service  refill service and innovative water dispensers 
based on estimates derived from industry data  we believe the current household penetration rate of multi gallon water dispensers is estimated to be in the united states  with the vast majority of these households utilizing traditional home delivery services 
we believe the lack of innovation  design enhancement and functionality and the retail pricing structure of our competitors dispenser models have prevented greater household adoption 
compounding these issues  we believe there previously was no economical water bottle exchange and refill vending service with major retailer relationships throughout the united states and canada to promote dispenser usage beyond the traditional home delivery model 
we believe our exchange and refill services provide this alternative and we believe we are currently the only provider delivering a solution to retailers throughout united states and canada 
we believe there are over  major retail locations throughout the united states and canada that we can target to sell our dispensers or offer our exchange service and refill services 

table of contents our competitive strengths we believe that primo s competitive strengths include the following appeal to consumer preferences environmental awareness 
both our exchange and refill services incorporate the reuse of existing bottles  recycle water bottles when their lifecycle is complete and reduce landfill waste and fossil fuel usage compared to alternative methods of bottled water consumption 
value 
we provide consumers the opportunity for cost savings when consuming our bottled water compared to both single serve bottled water and typical home and office delivery services 
our water dispensers are sold at attractive retail prices in order to enhance consumer awareness and adoption of our exchange and refill services  increase household penetration and drive sales of our purified and filtered water 
convenience 
our exchange and refill services and water dispensers are available at major retail locations in the united states and canada 
in addition  our exchange and refill services provide consumers the convenience of either exchanging empty bottles and purchasing full bottles or refilling the empty bottles at any participating retailer 
taste 
we have dedicated significant time and effort to develop our water purification process and formulate the proprietary blend of mineral ingredients included in our primo purified water offered through our exchange service 
we believe that primo purified water has a silky smooth taste profile 
health and wellness 
as part of a desire to live a healthier lifestyle  we believe that consumers are increasingly focused on drinking more water relative to consumption of other beverages 
as we raise our brand awareness  we believe consumers will recognize that our water bottle exchange and refill vending services are an effective option for their water consumption needs 
key retail relationships served by a single vendor solution 
we believe we are the only provider of exchange and refill services with a single vendor solution for retailers in the united states and canada 
our direct sales force actively pursues headquarters based retail relationships to better serve our retail customers and to minimize layers of approval and decision making with regard to the addition of new retail locations 
our bottling and distribution network utilizes our mis tools and processes to optimize their production and distribution assets while servicing our retail customers 
we believe the combination of our major retail relationships  unique single vendor solution for retail customers  bottling and distribution network and our mis tools is difficult to replicate 
we anticipate these factors will facilitate our introduction of new purified water related products in the future 
ability to attract and retain consumers 
we offer razor razorblade products designed to generate recurring demand for primo water the razorblade through the initial sale of our innovative water dispensers the razor  which often include a coupon for a free multi gallon bottle of primo exchange or refill services 
we acquire new consumers and enhance recycling efforts by accepting most dispenser compatible water bottles in exchange for a recycle ticket discount toward the purchase of a full bottle of primo purified water 
in addition  we believe our offering of high quality water dispensers enhances consumer awareness and adoption of our exchange and refill services  increases household penetration and drives sales of our water 
efficient business model 
our business model allows us to efficiently offer our solutions to our retail partners and centrally manage our bottling and distribution network without a substantial capital investment 
we believe our business processes and mis tools enable us to manage the bottling and distribution of our water  servicing of our refill locations  our product quality  retailer inventory levels and the return of used bottles on a centralized basis  leveraging our invested capital and personnel 
benefit from management s proven track record 
we benefit greatly from management experience gained over the last years in exchange businesses to implement and refine best practices and develop and maintain key business relationships 
in addition to our chief executive officer  our chief financial officer and general manager dispensers all held comparable positions within the blue rhino organization during its rapid sales and location growth 
our chief operating officer  who joined the company in december  was previously employed by coinstar  inc where he was instrumental in building the redbox exchange business 

table of contents growth strategy we seek to increase our market share and drive further growth in our business by pursuing the following strategies increase penetration with existing retail relationships and develop new retail relationships 
we believe we have significant opportunities to increase store penetration with our existing retail relationships 
as of december   our exchange and refill services were offered at approximately a combined  of our top ten retailers locations 
such retailers present us an opportunity of approximately  additional exchange or refill locations 
there is minimal overlap where our exchange and refill services are offered 
we intend to further penetrate our other existing retail customers with our supplementary hydration solutions which collectively provide us the opportunity to be present in more than  additional exchange or refill locations 
our long term strategy includes increasing our locations to  to  retail store locations which includes new locations with our existing retail customers within our primary retail categories of home centers  hardware stores  mass merchants  membership warehouses  grocery stores  office supply stores  drug stores and discount general merchandise stores for our exchange and refill services 
we believe that the introduction of additional hydration solutions to our product portfolio will allow us to cross sell products to our existing and newly acquired retail customers 
drive consumer adoption through innovative water dispenser models 
we intend to continue to develop and sell innovative water dispensers at attractive retail prices  which we believe is critical to increasing consumer awareness and driving consumer adoption of our water services 
we believe the current household penetration rate of multi gallon water dispensers is approximately in the united states 
our long term strategy is to provide multiple purified water based beverages from a single primo water dispenser  which we believe will lead to greater household penetration  with consistent promotion of our exchange and refill services to supply the purified water 
at december   we offered our water dispensers at approximately  locations in the united states  including lowes home improvement  walmart  kmart  target  sam s club  and costco 
increase same store sales 
we sell our water dispensers at minimal margin and often provide a coupon for a free multi gallon bottle of water with the sale of various water dispensers at certain retailers to drive consumer demand for our exchange and refill services 
we believe increasing unit sales of primo water is dependent on generating greater consumer awareness of the environmentally friendly and economical aspects of and the convenience associated with our purified bottled water and our exchange and refill services 
we expect that our branding  cross promotion marketing and sales efforts will result in greater usage of our exchange and refill services 
develop and install other hydration solutions 
we believe we have significant opportunities to leverage our bottling and distribution network and our systems and processes to offer other environmentally friendly  economical  convenient and healthy hydration solutions to our retail partners without significant increases in our centralized costs 
pursue strategic acquisitions to augment geographic and retail relationships 
in addition to the acquisitions of the refill business and the canada bulk water exchange business  we believe opportunities exist to expand through selective acquisitions  including smaller water bottle exchange businesses with established retail accounts  other on premises self service water refill vending machine networks and retail accounts  ice dispenser machine networks and retail accounts and water dispenser or other beverage related appliance companies 

table of contents product overview water 
we have dedicated significant time and effort in developing our water purification process and formulating the proprietary blend of mineral ingredients included in the purified bottled water offered through our exchange service 
our proprietary blend of mineral ingredients was developed with the assistance of consultants and several months of lab work and taste tests and has what we believe to be a silky smooth taste 
to ensure that our safety standards are met and united states food and drug administration fda and industry standards are met or exceeded  each production lot of our purified water undergoes chemical and microbiological testing by the bottler and all facilities bottling primo purified water undergo regular hygiene audits by a third party hired by us 
our refill service consists of carbon filtration and a reverse osmosis water filtration system that provides filtered drinking water  which is periodically tested for quality 
all state or industry standards related to our purified or filtered water are met or exceeded 
water bottles 
we currently source three and five gallon water bottles from multiple independent vendors for use in our exchange service 
each of our primo water bottles includes a handle designed for easy transportation and lifting when installing the bottle onto or into one of our water dispensers 
our bottles also include a specially designed cap that prevents spills when carrying or installing 
for our refill service  we offer empty reusable one  two  three and five gallon bottles for a sales display that typically accompany a refill vending machine  which are sourced from several manufacturers 
water dispensers 
we currently source and market four lines of water dispensers comprised of approximately models 
our dispensers are designed to dispense primo and other dispenser compatible bottled water 
our dispensers have manufacturer suggested retail prices that range from for our top of the line bottom loading model with a stainless steel finish to for a simple pump that can be installed on a bottle and operated by hand 
currently  more than of our dispenser sales are attributable to our bottom and top loading products 
consistent with our environmental focus  our electric dispensers are energy star rated  and  we believe  utilize less energy than competing water dispensers without this industry rating 
currently  all of our water dispensers are manufactured by independent suppliers in china 
primo water marketing our marketing efforts focus primarily on developing and maintaining a brand identity synonymous with an environmentally friendly  economical  convenient and healthy solution for purified water consumption 
we direct our marketing efforts as close as possible to the point of sale to strengthen our brand and promote consumer awareness of our exchange service 
we believe our exchange service develops consumer loyalty through the use of our recycling tickets  while our refill services develop consumer loyalty through preferred pricing 
our marketing efforts include the following initiatives i prominent display of our primo logo and distinctive four bubble design on water bottles  sales and recycling displays and water dispensers  ii highly visible sales and recycling center displays  and iii regular cross marketing promotions 

table of contents the primo supply chain water purification and bottling in our exchange services our independent bottlers are responsible for the water purification and bottling process and use their own equipment to complete this process 
our bottling process begins with either spring water or water from a public source that is processed through a pre filtration stage to remove large particles 
the water is then passed through polishing filters to catch smaller particles followed by a carbon filtration process that removes odors  tastes  sanitization by products and pharmaceutical chemicals 
a microfiltration process then removes microbes before the water is passed through a softener to increase the purification efficiency 
the water next passes through the last phase of reverse osmosis or distillation  completing the purification process 
after the purification process is complete  our proprietary blend of mineral ingredients is injected into the water followed by the final ozonation process to sanitize the water 
each of our production lots is placed on a hour hold to allow for testing by the bottler and to ensure successful compliance with chemical and microbiological standards 
we have the ability to trace each bottle of primo water to its bottling and distributor sources  and we regularly perform recall tests to ensure our ability to react to a contamination event should it occur 
our distributors are responsible for collecting empty primo bottles and other dispenser compatible bottles that are deposited into our recycling center displays 
at the completion of the delivery cycle  a distributor inspects the exchanged bottles for reusability and coordinates the recycling efforts with our operations personnel to ensure that reuse of each water bottle we receive in the exchange process is being optimized 
our water bottles can be sanitized and reused up to times before being taken out of use  crushed and recycled  substantially reducing landfill waste compared to consumption of similar amounts of single serve pet bottled water 
bottles that pass a distributor s initial inspection are subject to three washing cycles to wash and disinfect 
bottles are then passed through two sanitization stages before a final rinse with hyper ozonated water to kill or inactivate any microbes that remain at that point in the sanitization process 
the water bottles are then ready to be filled with our purified water 
reverse osmosis water filtration systems the reverse osmosis water filtration systems used in our refill service are placed under services agreements with retail customers who pay fees based on the number of gallons of water used or dispensed by the system 
under this program we own the water filtration system and contract with our distributors for the provision of all required service and maintenance 
water meters are generally read monthly by our distributors and an invoice is subsequently delivered to the retailer 
the reverse osmosis water filtration system is comprised of two components reverse osmosis water filtration equipment and a refill vending machine 
the water filtration equipment is typically installed in the back room of a retail location and all such equipment generally has the same component filters and parts 
a water line is installed from the water filtration equipment to the refill vending machine 
the retail customer will specify the location of the refill vending machine  which is typically in the water aisle or back wall of the store 
the retail customer is responsible for the plumbing  electrical and drainage requirements of an installation 
the regular maintenance  completed by our distributors  generally includes a monthly sanitization of the refill vending machine  a monthly system component check and any necessary preventative maintenance resulting from such component check and may include a water test for regulatory purposes 
the various jurisdictions in which we operate have specific weekly  bimonthly  monthly  quarterly or annual water testing reporting requirements with which our distributors comply  but they perform water tests on each refill vending machine unit at least quarterly 
we outsource an operations team which assembles  refurbishes and repairs the refill vending machines 
this team routinely refurbishes equipment that has been in service for several years or when a customer requests a refreshed system 
the operations team also procures new filtration systems component parts and assembles the units and ships them to locations for installation by our distributors 
the component parts are generally sourced from multiple suppliers 

table of contents distribution network we rely on our bottling and distribution network to deliver our exchange and refill solutions to retailers 
our exchange process begins when a distributor is directed through our proprietary mis tool  primolink  to stock or replenish exchange locations 
primolink enables our distributors to review delivery quantities and tentative scheduling requirements in their territory 
our systems provide anticipated demand based on historical sales and  to the extent available  retailer point of sale pos data 
each distributor is provided information to enable the distributor to load a truck with the appropriate inventory to stock or restock the exchange sales displays on its route  including a tailored amount of excess bottles as safety stock 
upon arrival at each retail location  the driver first visits the recycling center display to collect empty primo and other dispenser compatible bottles 
the driver enters data related to empty bottles on a handheld device to collect exchange efficiency information and potential customer conversion data and then loads empty bottles onto the truck 
the driver next checks the in store sales display to compare the number of remaining bottles of water with the anticipated demand report generated by our mis tools 
after entering current stock levels  the driver replenishes the sales display 
at the completion of the delivery cycle and after inspection of the bottles  our distributors are responsible for coordinating the sanitization and bottling process with our bottlers 
in addition  distributors must run end of day reports on their handheld devices which transmit crucial data points into our databases and validate daily activity 
our handheld devices also capture electronic signatures  significantly reducing paper exchange 
this greatly improves our verification procedures and enhances our environmental efforts 
we have the ability to test and refine procedures through our company operated distribution system before implementing them with our independent distributors nationwide 
in addition  we regularly solicit feedback from our independent distributors to improve processes 
our refill process begins when a distributor is directed through a proprietary dispatching mis tool  to schedule meter readings  quality testing  preventative maintenance and repairs 
our systems allow the distributor to see the previous meter read or previous performed preventative maintenance 
the distributors are responsible for the initial installation of the reverse osmosis water filtration systems  the regular maintenance of the systems  any necessary repairs  routine water testing and monthly meter reading to determine retail customer water usage 
flow of payments and capital requirements we control the flow of payments between our retail customers and our bottlers and distributors through electronic data interchange 
depending on the retailer  our distributors either present the store manager with an invoice for the bottles delivered or meter reading or our systems electronically bill the retailer 
we believe our exchange service provides five gallon bottles of purified water that typically cost a consumer between and  after giving effect to the discount provided by our recycling ticket  while our refill service typically costs a consumer between and per gallon  depending upon the location and the retailer s overall pricing strategy 
we generally compensate our distributors with a fixed payment per delivered exchange water bottle 
we compensate our refill services providers on a fixed service fee per location or a commission based upon a percentage of total revenues at the locations for which the distributor is responsible  subject to minimum and maximum amounts 
due to the high degree of automation during our billing and inventory management procedures  we are able to leverage our centralized personnel and believe we will be able to significantly expand our business with minimal increases in variable costs 
we focus our capital investments on developing new retail relationships  installing new store locations  raising brand awareness  research and development for new products and maintaining our mis tools 
we are also responsible for the centralized operations and personnel  sales and recycling displays  bottles  closures  transportation racks  mineral packets and mineral injectors  reverse osmosis equipment and parts  vending displays and handheld devices 
our bottling and distribution network typically has made the capital investment required to operate our services  including a majority of the capital expenditures related to the bottling  sanitization and refill process and the distribution assets such as delivery trucks and warehouse storage 
participation in our exchange or refill service does not typically require the independent bottlers and distributors to make substantial new investments because they often are able to augment their current production capacity and leverage their existing bottling and distribution assets 
in addition  many of our major retail customers have invested their capital to expand store locations and generate customer traffic 

table of contents retailer relationships we target major retailers with either a national footprint or a significant regional concentration 
our relationships are diversified among the following retail categories and major accounts retail category major accounts home centers hardware stores lowe s home improvement  ace hardware  true value mass merchants walmart  target  kmart  meijer grocery stores kroger  food lion  safeway  sobeys  h e b  hy vee  winn dixie membership warehouses sam s club  costco drug stores walgreens  cvs office retail office depot retailer opportunity

our services provide retailers with a year round consumer product and an opportunity to increase sales and profits with minimal labor and financial investment 
through our bottling and distribution network  we are able to service major retailers nationwide 
retailers benefit from our exchange and refill services that offer high margin and generate productivity from often underutilized interior and exterior retail space 
in addition  these services have the potential to increase retailers sales of ancillary products through increased traffic from repeat water consumers  who we believe purchase an average of water bottles annually 
account set up 
we actively pursue headquarters based retail relationships to better serve our retail partners and minimize layers of approval and decision making with regard to the roll out of our exchange or refill service to multiple locations 
upon confirmation of new retail locations  we coordinate with the retailer and distributor to schedule openings in a timely manner 
we actively assist retailers in developing site plans for the setup of our sales and recycling center displays and reverse osmosis water filtration systems 
while retailer setup preferences may vary  retailers often like to locate the recycling center display prominently on the exterior of their store to ease the transaction process  showcase their recycling and environmental efforts and conserve inside floor space while at the same time promoting the primo brand 
account service 
our exchange and refill services are turn key programs for retailers in which we and our distributors actively service each retail account 
after the retail location is established  our distributors complete on site training and have an economic interest in supporting and growing the business relationship to increase product throughput 
sales support 
while distributors service our retail accounts  the customer relationship is owned and maintained by our experienced retail sales organization  which allows us to develop strong brand affinity and maintain key headquarters based relationships to secure and maintain our retail network 
our retail relationships are divided into regions and managed by our sales personnel 
in addition  we leverage our independent distributors who typically employ their own sales representatives

distributors are generally required to develop an infrastructure sufficient to complete customer installations within days of the notification of a newly established account  monitor and maintain inventory levels with assigned retail accounts  and resolve water bottle stock outs within hours 
bottler and distributor selection process 
we have selectively identified and pursued high quality independent bottlers and distributors that can support our major retailers nationwide 
we screen all independent bottler and distributor candidates by reviewing credit reports  safety records and manufacturing compliance reports  and conducting management reference checks 
as a result of this thorough selection process  we have established what we believe to be highly dependable relationships with our independent bottlers and distributors 
we believe we have a positive relationship with each of these parties and our senior executives have maintained a business relationship with many of our key distributors since they were managing operations at blue rhino corporation

we utilize microsoft s dynamics gp software as our core platform which interfaces with all of our systems 
each handheld device is based on microsoft s operating system and ensures integration within our reporting and financial databases 
all transactions are validated and data is imported into our database tables and mapped to corresponding accounting ledgers 
manufacturing and sourcing our manufacturing strategy is to utilize independent manufacturers to produce empty water bottles  sales displays and recycle centers  refill vending machines and water dispensers at a reasonable cost 
we believe that using independent manufacturers has several advantages over our manufacturing these items directly  including i decreased capital investment in manufacturing plants and equipment and working capital  ii the ability to leverage independent manufacturers purchasing relationships for lower materials costs  iii minimal fixed costs of maintaining unused manufacturing capacity and iv the ability to utilize our suppliers broad technical and process expertise 
currently  all of our water dispensers are assembled by independent manufacturers in china  which utilize several sub suppliers to provide components and subassemblies 
we have the sole north american rights to develop products with certain manufacturers and each dispenser unit is produced to our design specifications 
each unit is inspected and tested for quality by the manufacturer s personnel prior to shipment and any units returned by consumers or retailers are reported to the manufacturer  who issues a credit  replacement or refund 
our water bottles and caps are produced by multiple independent vendors throughout the united states 
we select suppliers based on price  quality and geographic proximity to our bottlers and retail customers 
we only purchase water bottles for our exchange services with handles as a convenience feature for consumers 
our sales displays  recycle centers and refill vending machines are made to our design 
we frequently request bids from multiple independent manufacturers to achieve optimal pricing

in addition  we are developing a water dispenser product that provides consumers the ability to dispense hot and cold still water as well as cold carbonated water 
these units may also support the addition of existing single serve hot beverage makers 
competition we participate in the highly competitive bottled water segment of the nonalcoholic beverage industry 
while the industry is dominated by large and well known international companies  numerous smaller firms are also seeking to establish market niches 
we believe we have a unique business model in the bottled water market in the united states in that we not only offer three and five gallon bottled water on a nationwide basis but also provide consumers the ability to exchange their used containers as part of our exchange service 
we believe that we are one of the first companies to provide a national exchange service at retail 
while we are aware of a few direct competitors that operate similar networks  we believe they operate on a much smaller scale than we do and do not have equivalent mis tools or bottler and distributor capabilities to effectively support major retailers nationwide 
competitive factors with respect to our business include pricing  taste  advertising  sales promotion programs  product innovation  efficient production and distribution techniques  introduction of new packaging  and brand and trademark development and protection 

table of contents our primary competitors in our united states exchange business include nestl and ds waters of america 
nestl and ds waters of america offer this service on a regional basis  but not on a national basis 
however  these competitors are leading consumer products companies  have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do  have established a strong brand presence with consumers and have established relationships with retailers  manufacturers  bottlers and distributors necessary to start an exchange business at retail locations nationwide should they decide to do so 
in addition to competition between firms within the bottled water industry  the industry itself faces significant competition from other non alcoholic beverages  including carbonated and non carbonated soft drinks and waters  juices  sport and energy drinks  coffees  teas and spring and tap water 
we also compete directly and indirectly in the water dispenser marketplace 
this marketplace is diverse and faces competition from other methods of purified water consumption such as countertop filtration systems  faucet mounted filtration systems  in line whole house filtration systems  water filtration dispensing products such as pitchers and jugs  standard and advanced feature water coolers and refrigerator dispensed filtered and unfiltered water 
our refill service also participates in the highly competitive purified water segment of the nonalcoholic beverage industry 
while the industry is dominated by large and well known international companies  numerous smaller firms are also seeking to establish market niches 
our refill service business model is differentiated from most of the participants in the north american nonalcoholic beverage industry in that it offers self service refill of drinking water 
there are a few direct competitors that offer similar refill vending services  but with the exception of glacier water services  inc  we believe these direct competitors generally operate on a smaller geographical and operational scale than our refill service 
our refill service faces two levels of competition i competition at the retail customer level to secure placement of its reverse osmosis water filtration systems in the store  and ii competition at an end user level to convince consumers to purchase its water versus other options 
competitive factors with respect to our refill service include pricing  taste  advertising  sales promotion programs  retail placement  introduction of new packaging and branding 
many of the indirect competitors in the bottled water segment of the nonalcoholic beverage industry are leading consumer products companies  have substantially greater financial and other resources than us  have established a strong brand presence with consumers and have established relationships with retailers  manufacturers  bottlers and distributors necessary to start a self service drinking water refill business at north american retail locations should they decide to do so

we own ten united states federal trademark registrations  including registrations for our primo and taste perfection trademarks  our primo logo and our distinctive four bubble design 
us federal trademark registrations generally have a perpetual duration if they are properly maintained and renewed 
we also own a pending application to register our zero waste 
perfect tastetm trademark in the united states and canada for use in association with drinking water dispensers  bottled drinking water and a variety of other non alcoholic beverages 
in addition  the design of our recycling center displays is protected by four united states design patents and two canadian industrial design registrations 
the united states design patents expire between may and april and  the canadian industrial design registrations expire in may 
table of contents in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets and other non patented proprietary information relating to our product development  business processes and operating activities 
we regard portions of our proprietary mis tools  various algorithms used in our business and the composition of our mineral formula to be valuable trade secrets of primo 
we seek to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy  including confidentiality agreements 
governmental regulation the conduct of our businesses and the production  distribution  advertising  promotion  labeling  safety  transportation  sale and use of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal  state  provincial and local governmental agencies in the united states and canada 
it is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations that apply to us  and we require our bottling  manufacturing  and distributing partners to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to them 
we are required to comply with federal laws  such as the us federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the canadian food and drug act and the us occupational safety and health act  customs and foreign trade laws and regulations  state and provincial consumer protection laws  federal  state  provincial and local environmental  health and safety laws  laws governing equal employment opportunity and workplace activities  and various other federal  state  provincial and local statutes and regulations 
we maintain environmental  health and safety policies and a quality  environmental  health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the fda regulates bottled water as a food under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
our bottled water must meet fda requirements of safety for human consumption  identity  quality and labeling 
the canadian health canada division regulates bottled water in canada 
our bottled water must meet fda and health canada hc requirements of safety for human consumption  identity  quality and labeling 
further  the sale and marketing of our products is subject to fda s and hc s and the us ftc and canadian competition bureau advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions 
in addition  fda and hc has established current good manufacturing practice regulations  which govern the facilities  methods  practices and controls used for the processing  bottling and distribution of bottled drinking water 
we and our third party supply  bottling and distribution partners are subject to these requirements 
we also must comply with overlapping and sometimes inconsistent state and provincial regulations in various jurisdictions 
as a result  we must expend resources to continuously monitor state and provincial legislative and regulatory activities for purposes of identifying and ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to our bottled water business in each state in which we operate 
while we must meet the government mandated standards  we believe that our self imposed standards meet or exceed those set by federal  state  provincial and local regulations 
additionally  the manufacture  sale and use of resins used to make water bottles are subject to regulation by the fda and hc 
those regulations are concerned with substances used in food packaging materials  not with specific finished food packaging products 
we believe our beverage containers are in compliance with fda and hc regulations 
additionally  the use of polycarbonates in food containers used by children under three years of age is subject to certain state and local restrictions 

table of contents measures have been enacted in various localities  provinces and states that require a deposit or tax to be charged for certain non refillable beverage containers 
the precise requirements imposed by these measures vary 
other deposit  recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in various jurisdictions 
we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local  state  provincial and federal levels 
the refill vending machines used with the reverse osmosis water filtration systems are certified by the national automatic merchandising association nama 
nama maintains a vending machine certification program which evaluates food and beverage vending machines against current requirements of the us public health service ordinance and code 
currently  there are no us or canadian regulations that cover refill vending machines 
however  certain states  provinces and other regional localities have permit and testing requirements for the operation of the refill vending machines 
seasonality we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and operating income 
our sales and operating income have been highest in the spring and summer  and lowest in the fall and winter 
our exchange and refill services  which generally enjoy higher margins than our sales of water dispensers  experience higher sales and operating income in the spring and summer 
we have historically experienced higher sales and operating income from our water dispensers in spring and summer  however  we believe the seasonality of dispenser sales will be more dependent on retailer inventory management and purchasing cycles and not correlated to weather 
sustained periods of poor weather  particularly in the spring and summer  can negatively impact our sales in our higher margin exchange and refill services 
accordingly  our results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a fiscal year or any future quarter 
employees as of december   we had employees  all of whom were full time 
we believe that our continued success will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled personnel 
we have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good

item a 
risk factors risks relating to our business and industry we have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future 
we have incurred operating losses in the past and expect to incur operating losses in the future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our losses from continuing operations were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we have not been profitable since our inception  and we may not become profitable in the future 
our losses may continue as we incur additional costs and expenses related to branding and marketing  expansion of operations  strategic acquisitions  product development  development of relationships with strategic business partners  regulatory compliance and litigation 
if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  our financial performance will be adversely affected 
if our sales do not grow to offset these increased expenses  we may not become profitable 
if we do not achieve sustained profitability  we may be unable to continue operations 

table of contents we may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms  if at all  or without dilution to our stockholders 
at december   our cash totaled million and we had approximately million in additional availability under the senior revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  availability under the senior revolving credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our needs for general corporate purposes for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need or desire additional capital to finance our operations or to execute on our current or future business strategies  including to expand the number of retail store locations in which our products and services are offered  enhance our operating infrastructure  acquire new businesses  products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  particularly in light of the current economic downturn and the restrictions included in the documents governing our current indebtedness 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  when we desire them  our ability to invest in our operations  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance our services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited and we could be forced to reduce  delay or cancel capital expenditures  sell assets  or scale down our operations  all of which could harm our ability to generate revenues and reduce the value of our stock 
we depend on a small number of large retailers for most of our consumer sales 
our arrangements with these retailers for our bottled water exchange services and sales of our water dispensers are nonexclusive and may be terminated at will 
certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our retail sales volume  such that if one or more of these retailers were to materially reduce or terminate its business with us  our sales would suffer 
for  walmart and lowe s home improvement represented approximately and of our consolidated net sales  respectively 
while we sell a small percentage of our dispensers directly to consumers through our online store and other direct sales channels  the vast majority of our sales are made through our retail partners 
we have arrangements with certain retailers for our products and services  but we cannot provide any assurance of any future sales 
none of our significant retail accounts are contractually bound to offer our exchange service or water dispensers 
as a result  retailers can discontinue our exchange services or products at any time and offer a competitor s services or products  or none at all 
additionally  the contractual commitments of retail customers of our refill vending services are not long term in nature 
continued positive relations with a retailer depend upon various factors  including price  customer service  consumer demand and competition 
certain of our retailers have multiple vendor policies and may seek to offer a competitor s products or services at new or existing locations 
if any significant retailer materially reduces  terminates or is unwilling to expand its relationship with us  or requires price reductions or other adverse modifications in our selling terms  our sales would suffer 
additionally  most major retailers continually evaluate and often modify their in store retail strategies  including product placement  store set up and design  promotions and demographic targets 
our business could suffer significant setbacks in net sales and operating income if one or more of our major retail customers modified its current retail strategy resulting in a termination or reduction of its business relationship with us  a reduction in store penetration or an unfavorable product placement within such retailer s stores  any or all of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents the success of our business depends on retailer and consumer acceptance of our products and services 
we are a consumer products and services company operating in the highly competitive bottled water market and rely on continued consumer demand or preference for our products and services 
to generate sales and profits  we must sell products that appeal to retailers and to consumers 
our future success depends on consumer acceptance  particularly at the household level  of our products and services 
there is no guarantee that there will be significant market acceptance of our exchange and refill services or that we will be successful in selling our water dispensers on a scale necessary to achieve sustained profitability 
as a result of our razor razorblade business strategy  we are reliant on consumer adoption of our razors water dispensers to drive sales of the razorblades exchange and refill services 
if we are unable to generate consumer adoption of our water dispensers  we will face significant difficulties growing sales of our exchange and refill services  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the markets for our products and services are evolving rapidly and we may not be able to accurately assess the size of the markets or trends that may emerge and affect our businesses 
consumer preference can change due to a variety of factors  including social trends  negative publicity and economic changes 
if we are unable to convince current and potential retail customers and individual consumers of the advantages of our products and services  our ability to sell our products and services will be limited 
consumer acceptance also will affect  and be affected by  our existing retail partners and potential new retail partners decisions to sell our products and services and their perception of the likelihood of consumers purchasing our products and services 
even if retail customers purchase our products or services  there is no guarantee that they will be successful in selling our products or services to consumers on a scale necessary for us to achieve sustained profitability 
any significant changes in consumer preferences for purified bottled water could result in reduced demand for our products and services and erosion of our competitive and financial position 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  face competition from companies with far greater resources than we have and could encounter significant competition from these companies in our niche markets of water bottle exchange services and related products and refill vending services 
we primarily participate in the highly competitive bottled water segment of the nonalcoholic beverage industry 
the industry is dominated by large and well known international companies  and numerous smaller firms are also seeking to establish market niches 
in our business model  we not only offer three and five gallon bottled water but also provide consumers the ability to exchange their used containers as part of our exchange service 
while we are aware of a few direct competitors that operate water bottle exchange networks at retail  we believe they operate on a much smaller scale than we do and we believe they do not have equivalent mis tools or bottling and distribution capabilities to effectively support major retailers nationwide 
competitive factors with respect to our business include pricing  taste  advertising  sales promotion programs  product innovation  increased efficiency in production and distribution techniques  the introduction of new packaging and brand and trademark development and protection 
our primary competitors in our bottled water business include nestl  the coca cola company  pepsico  dr pepper snapple group and ds waters of america 
while none of these companies currently offers a nationwide water bottle exchange service at retail  nestl and ds waters of america offer this service on a regional basis 
many of these competitors are leading consumer products companies  have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do  have established a strong brand presence with consumers and have established relationships with retailers  manufacturers  bottlers and distributors necessary to start an exchange business at retail locations nationwide should they decide to do so 
our refill vending services business faces direct competition in its industry and for its retail customers from glacier water services  inc  which has a strong brand presence and greater financial and other resources than we have 
competitors with greater financial resources may put pressure on the prices at which we offer our products and services which would have a negative impact on our margins 
in addition to competition between companies within the bottled water industry  the industry itself faces significant competition from other non alcoholic beverages  including carbonated and non carbonated soft drinks and waters  juices  sport and energy drinks  coffees  teas and spring and tap water 

table of contents our bottled water business also faces competition from other methods of purified water consumption such as countertop filtration systems  faucet mounted filtration systems  in line whole house filtration systems  water filtration dispensing products such as pitchers and jugs  standard and advanced feature water coolers and refrigerator dispensed filtered and unfiltered water 
we also compete directly and indirectly in the water dispenser marketplace 
there are many large consumer products companies with substantially greater financial and other resources  a larger brand presence with consumers and established relationships with retailers that could decide to enter the marketplace 
should any of these consumer products companies so decide to enter the water dispenser marketplace  sales of our water dispensers could be materially and adversely impacted  which  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our sales of bottled water 
if the distributors of our refill vending services do not perform to retailer expectations  our retail relationships may be adversely impacted and business may suffer 
with respect to our refill vending services  we primarily rely on third party distributors to install  maintain and repair the reverse osmosis water systems at our retail customers locations 
these third party distributors are also responsible for providing retail customer training with respect to the reverse osmosis water systems  submitting water for testing and conducting monthly meter readings to determine water usage for billing purposes 
accordingly  the success of our refill vending services depends on our ability to manage our retail relationships through the performance of these distributors 
the significant majority of these distributors are independent dealers and we exercise only limited influence over the resources they devote to their responsibilities with respect to our retail customers 
our success with respect to our refill vending services currently depends on our ability to establish and maintain relationships with these third party distributors and on the distributors ability to operate viable businesses 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain such relationships 
retail customers of our refill vending services impose demanding service requirements and we could suffer a loss of retailer or consumer goodwill if these distributors do not perform to the retail customers expectations 
the poor performance of a single service provider to a major retailer could jeopardize our entire relationship with that retailer potentially preventing future installations at additional retail locations and causing sales to suffer 
in our bottled water exchange business  we depend on independent bottlers  distributors and suppliers for our business to operate 
we are and will continue to be for the foreseeable future  substantially dependent on independent bottlers  distributors and suppliers to bottle and deliver our bottled water products and provide our exchange service to our retail customers 
we do not have our own manufacturing facilities to produce bottled water products 
we are and will continue to be for the foreseeable future  entirely dependent on third parties to supply the bottle pre forms  bottles  water and other materials necessary to operate our bottled water business 
we rely on third party supply companies to manufacture our three and five gallon water bottles and deliver them to our bottlers 
in turn  we rely on bottlers to properly purify the water  include our mineral enhancements and bottle the finished product without contamination and pursuant to our quality standards and preparation procedures 
finally  we rely upon our distributors to deliver bottled water to our retail partners in a timely manner  accurately enter information regarding the delivery of the bottles into our management information system  manage our recycling center displays and return used bottles to the bottlers to be sanitized or crushed and recycled 
we can make no assurance that we will be able to maintain these third party relationships or establish additional relationships as necessary to support growth and profitability of our business on economically viable terms 
as independent companies  these bottlers  distributors and suppliers make their own business decisions 
suppliers may choose not to do business with us for a variety of reasons  including competition  brand identity  product standards and concerns regarding our economic viability 
they may have the right to determine whether  and to what extent  they produce and distribute our products  our competitors products and their own products 
some of the business for these bottlers  distributors and suppliers comes from producing or selling our competitors products 
these bottlers  distributors and suppliers may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands 
in addition  their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control and our business could suffer 
in addition  we will face risks associated with any bottler s or distributor s failure to adhere to quality control and service guidelines we establish or failure to ensure an adequate and timely supply of product and services at retail locations 
any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain a source of supply for bottles  water and other materials  our business will be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents in our bottled water exchange business  if our distributors do not perform to our retailers expectations  if we encounter difficulties in managing our distributor operations or if we or our distributors are not able to manage growth effectively  our retail relationships may be adversely impacted and business may suffer 
we rely on our distributors to deliver our three and five gallon bottled water and provide our exchange service to retailers 
accordingly  our success depends on our ability to manage our retail relationships through the performance of our distributor partners 
the majority of our current distributors are independent and we exercise only limited influence over the resources they devote to delivery and exchange of our three and five gallon water bottles 
our success depends on our ability to establish and maintain distributor relationships and on the distributors ability to operate viable businesses 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain such relationships or establish additional relationships as necessary to support growth and profitability of our business on economically viable terms 
our retailers impose demanding service requirements on us and we could suffer a loss of consumer or retailer goodwill if our distributors do not adhere to our quality control and service guidelines or fail to ensure an adequate and timely supply of bottled water at retail locations 
the poor performance of a single distributor to a major retailer could jeopardize our entire relationship with that retailer and cause our bottled water sales and exchange service to suffer 
in addition  the number of retail locations offering our exchange service and our corresponding sales have grown significantly over the past several years along with our national distributor network 
accordingly  our distributors must be able to adequately service an increasing number of retail accounts 
if we or our distributors fail to manage our growth effectively  our bottled water sales and exchange service may suffer 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel  our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered 
in addition  we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 
we are highly dependent upon the services of our senior management because of their experience  industry relationships and knowledge of the business 
we are particularly dependent on the services of billy d 
prim  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
we do not have a formal succession plan in place for mr 
prim 
the loss of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our business and we may not be able to attract and retain individuals with the same or similar level of experience or expertise 
we face competition for qualified employees from numerous sources and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms 
our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors  such as our results of operations  prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel 
failure to recruit and retain such personnel could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while our employment agreements with members of our senior management include customary confidentiality  non competition and non solicitation covenants  there can be no assurance that such provisions will be enforceable or adequately protect us 
we have substantial canadian operations and are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and political uncertainties 
we have substantial canadian operations  and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
risks inherent to operating internationally include changes in a country s economic or political conditions  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

table of contents to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced when translated into united states dollars 
in our water dispenser business  because all of our dispensers are manufactured in china  a significant disruption in the operations of these manufacturers or political unrest in china could materially adversely affect us 
we have only three manufacturers of water dispensers 
any disruption in production or inability of our manufacturers to produce quantities of water dispensers adequate to meet our needs could significantly impair our ability to operate our water dispenser business on a day to day basis 
our manufacturers are located in china  which exposes us to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the chinese government  political unrest or unstable economic conditions in china  changes in currency exchange rates or developments in the us that are adverse to trade  including enactment of protectionist legislation 
in addition  our dispensers are shipped directly from the manufacturer to our retail partners 
although we routinely inspect and monitor our manufacturing partners activities and products  we rely heavily upon their quality controls when producing and delivering the dispensers to our retail partners 
any of these matters could materially adversely affect our water dispenser business and  as a result  our profitability 
if the water we sell became contaminated  our business could be seriously harmed 
we have adopted various quality  environmental  health and safety standards 
however  our products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated 
a failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers  distributors or suppliers 
such a failure or contamination could result in expensive production interruptions  recalls and liability claims 
a widespread product recall could result in losses due to the costs of a recall  the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time 
we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us 
moreover  negative publicity could be generated even from false  unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls 
any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance 
if any component of our water dispensers we sell is misused  the appliance may fail and cause personal injury or property damage 
we may be subject to product liability claims as a result of any such failure  which will likely increase our costs and adversely affect our business and reputation 
although we include explicit instructions for the operation of our water dispensers we sell and safety warnings are included on all of the products we sell  consumers may misuse these products  including by tampering with the hot water safety lock devices  which could expose consumers to hot liquids 
the misuse of any of the components of our water dispensers we sell may cause personal injury and damage to property 
our product liability insurance for personal injury and damage to property may not be sufficient or available to cover any successful product liability claim  or similar claims  against us  which could materially adversely impact our financial condition 
whether or not a claim against us would be successful  defense of the claim may be costly and the existence of any claim may adversely impact our reputation  financial condition or results of operations 
interruption or disruption of our supply chain  distribution channels  bottling and distribution network or third party services providers could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability and that of our business partners  including suppliers  bottlers  distributors  retailers and third party distributors  to manufacture  sell and deliver products and services is critical to our success 
interruption or disruption of our supply chain  distribution channels or service network due to unforeseen events  including war  terrorism and other international conflicts  public health issues  natural disasters such as earthquakes  fires  hurricanes or other adverse weather and climate conditions  strikes and other labor disputes  whether occurring in the united states or abroad  could impair our ability to manufacture  sell or deliver our products and services 

table of contents the consolidation of retail customers may adversely impact our operating margins and profitability 
our customers  such as mass merchants  supermarkets  warehouse clubs  food distributors and drug and pharmacy stores  have consolidated in recent years and consolidation may continue 
these consolidations have produced large  sophisticated customers with increased buying power 
as a result  we are increasingly dependent on key retailers  which have significant bargaining power 
if we fail to respond to these trends in our industry  our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase trade promotions and consumer marketing for our products and services  both of which would adversely affect our margins and our financial results 
these retailers may use floor or shelf space currently used for our products and services for their own private label products and services 
in addition  retailers are increasingly carrying fewer brands in any one category and our results of operations will suffer if we are not selected by our significant customers to remain a vendor 
in the event of consolidation involving our current retailers  we may lose key business if the surviving entities do not continue to purchase products or services from us 
while many members of our senior management have experience as executives of a products and exchange services business  there can be no assurances that this experience and past success will result in our business becoming profitable 
many members of our senior management have had experience as senior managers of a company engaged in the supply  distribution and exchange of propane gas cylinders 
while the business model for that company and the model for our business are similar  the propane gas industry and the bottled water industry are very different 
for example  there are no assurances that consumer demand will exist for our products and services 
while we believe our business model will be successful  any similarity between our business model and that of our senior management s predecessor employer should not be viewed as an indication that we will be profitable 
we depend on key management information systems 
we depend on our management information systems mis to process orders  manage inventory and accounts receivable  maintain distributor and customer information  maintain cost efficient operations and assist distributors in delivering products and services on a timely basis 
any disruption in the operation of our mis tools  the loss of employees knowledgeable about such systems  the termination of our relationships with third party mis partners or our failure to continue to effectively modify such systems as business expands could require us to expend significant additional resources or to invest additional capital to continue to manage our business effectively  and could even affect our compliance with public reporting requirements 
additionally  our mis tools are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from  among other things  natural disasters  terrorist attacks  software  equipment or telecommunications failures  processing errors  computer viruses  hackers  other security issues or supplier defaults 
security  backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures 
any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors  processing inefficiencies  security breaches  inability to use the systems or process transactions  loss of customers or other business disruptions  all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance 
we are subject to inventory loss and theft 
we are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft 
we have experienced inventory shrinkage in the past  and we cannot assure you that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively address the problem of inventory shrinkage 
although some level of inventory shrinkage is a necessary and unavoidable cost of doing business  if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft  our financial condition could be affected adversely 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of the impairment of intangibles 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  we must identify and value intangible assets that we acquire in business combinations  such as customer arrangements  customer relationships and non compete agreements  that arise from contractual or other legal rights or that are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
the fair value of identified intangible assets is based upon an estimate of the future economic benefits expected to result from ownership  which represents the amount at which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 

table of contents us gaap provides that intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
us gaap also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non amortized intangible assets for impairment 
absent any impairment indicators  we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter 
we review our intangible assets with definite lives for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  as required by us gaap 
an impairment of intangible assets with definite lives exists if the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected is less than the carrying value of the assets 
if this measurement indicates a possible impairment  we compare the estimated fair value of the asset to the net book value to measure the impairment charge  if any 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of intangible assets that totaled million at december  such events include strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  material negative changes in our relationships with material customers and other parties breaching their contractual obligations under non compete agreements 
future impairments  if any  will be recognized as operating expenses 
if we are unable to build and maintain our brand image and corporate reputation  our business may suffer 
we are a relatively new company  having been formed in late and commenced operations in june our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products and services and effectively build the brand image for any new products 
we cannot assure you  however  that any additional expenditures on advertising and marketing will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preferences 
actual or perceived product quality issues or allegations of product contamination  even if false or unfounded  could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause consumers to choose other products 
allegations of product defects or product contamination  even if untrue  may require us from time to time to recall a product from all of the markets in which the affected product was distributed 
product recalls would negatively affect our profitability and brand image 
also  adverse publicity surrounding water usage and any campaigns by activists attempting to connect our system to environmental issues  water shortages or workplace or human rights violations in certain developing countries in which we or our business partners operate  could negatively affect our overall reputation and our products acceptance by consumers 
adverse weather conditions could negatively impact our business 
unseasonable or unusual weather may negatively impact demand for our products 
the sales of our bottled water products  water dispensers and refill vending services are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate 
unusually cool or rainy weather may reduce temporarily the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods 
water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact our long term profitability 
water is a limited resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation  population growth  increasing pollution  poor management and climate change 
as demand for water continues to increase and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates  our business may incur increasing costs or face capacity constraints which could adversely affect our profitability or net sales in the long run 
our financial results and achievement of our growth strategy is dependent on our continued innovation and the successful development and launch of new products and product extensions 
achievement of our growth strategy is dependent  among other things  on our ability to extend the product offerings of our existing brands and introduce innovative new products 
although we devote significant focus to the development of new products  we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful 
our financial results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our ability to effectively gauge the direction of our key marketplaces and successfully identify  develop  manufacture  market and sell new or improved products in these changing marketplaces 
in addition  our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights  which could negatively impact our results of operations 

table of contents we may pursue acquisitions and investments in new product lines  businesses or technologies that involve numerous risks  which could disrupt our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may in the future acquire or invest in new product lines  businesses or technologies to expand our current products and services 
acquisitions present a number of potential risks and challenges that could disrupt our business operations  increase our operating costs or capital expenditure requirements and reduce the value of the acquired product line  business or technology 
for example  if we identify an acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition on favorable terms or at all 
the process of negotiating acquisitions and integrating acquired products  services  technologies  personnel or businesses might result in significant transaction costs  operating difficulties or unexpected expenditures and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
if we are successful in consummating an acquisition  we may not be able to integrate the acquired product line  business or technology into our existing business and products and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
furthermore  potential acquisitions and investments may divert our management s attention  require considerable cash outlays and require substantial additional expenses that could harm our existing operations and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
to complete future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities  incur debt  assume contingent liabilities or incur amortization expenses and write downs of acquired assets  any of which could dilute the interests of our stockholders or adversely affect our profitability or cash flow 
current economic conditions and other economic factors could impact our business adversely in various respects 
a further slowdown in the us economy or other economic factors affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  inflation  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  consumer debt levels  lack of available credit  interest rates  and tax rates  may affect our business adversely by reducing overall consumer spending or by shifting the purchasing habits of our target consumers  both of which could result in lower net sales  decreases in inventory turnover or a reduction in profitability due to lower margins 
the current global economic uncertainty  the impact of recessions  and the potential for failures or realignments of financial institutions and the related impact on available credit may impact our suppliers  our distributors  our retail customers  and our operations in an adverse manner including  but not limited to  the inability of our retail customers to timely pay their obligations to us  thus reducing our cash flow  increased costs related to our distribution channels  the inability of our vendors to timely supply materials and an increased likelihood that our lender may be unable to honor its commitments under our senior revolving credit facility 
risks relating to regulatory and legal issues our products and services are heavily regulated in the united states and canada 
if we are unable to continue to comply with applicable regulations and standards in any jurisdiction  we might not be able to sell our products in that jurisdiction or they could be recalled  and our business could be seriously harmed 
the production  distribution and sale of our products in the united states are subject to regulation by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdca  and by other regulatory authorities under the occupational safety and health act  the lanham act and various environmental statutes 
in canada  these activities are subject to regulation by health canada and the canadian food inspection agency the cfia under the canadian food and drugs act 
we are also subject to various other federal  state  provincial and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production  transportation  sale  safety  advertising  promotion  labeling and ingredients of such products 
for example  measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require a deposit to be charged for certain non refillable beverage containers 
the precise requirements imposed by these measures vary 
other deposit  recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in various jurisdictions 
we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local  state and federal levels 

table of contents the fda regulates bottled water as a food under the fdca 
our bottled water must meet fda and cfia requirements of safety for human consumption  identity  quality and labeling 
further  any claims we make in marketing our products  such as claims related to the beneficial health effects of drinking water  are subject to fda s and canadian competition bureau s advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions 
in addition  the fda and hc have established current good manufacturing practices  regulations which govern the facilities  methods  practices and controls used for the processing  bottling and distribution of bottled drinking water 
we are subject to additional or changing requirements under the recently enacted federal food safety modernization act of  which requires among other things  that food facilities conduct contamination hazard analyses  implement risk based preventive controls and develop track and trace capabilities 
we and our third party bottling and distribution partners are subject to these requirements 
in addition  all public drinking water must meet environmental protection agency standards established under the safe drinking water act for mineral and chemical concentration and drinking water quality and treatment 
we also must comply with overlapping and  in some cases  inconsistent state regulations in a variety of areas 
these state level regulations  among other things  set standards for approved water sources and the information that must be provided and the basis on which any therapeutic claims for water may be made 
in canada  we are subject to similar regulations administered by health canada and the cfia  as well as provincial authorities 
we must expend resources to continuously monitor national  state and provincial legislative and regulatory activities in order to identify and ensure compliance with laws and regulations that apply to our bottled water business in each state and province in which we operate 
additionally  the manufacture  sale and use of resins used to make water bottles are subject to regulation by the fda and hc 
these regulations relate to substances used in food packaging materials  not with specific finished food packaging products 
our beverage containers are deemed to be in compliance with fda regulations if the components used in the containers i are approved by the fda and hc as indirect food additives for their intended uses and comply with the applicable fda indirect food additive regulations  or ii are generally recognized as safe for their intended uses and are of suitable purity for those intended uses 
the consumer product safety commission  fda  health canada  cfia or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall  repair or replacement of our products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations 
the failure of our third party manufacturers or bottlers to produce merchandise that adheres to our quality control standards could damage our reputation and lead to customer litigation against us 
if our manufacturers or distributors are unable or unwilling to recall products failing to meet our quality standards  we may be required to remove merchandise or recall those products at a substantial cost to us 
we may be unable to recover costs related to product recalls 
we believe that our self imposed standards meet or exceed those set by federal  state  provincial and local regulations 
in addition  we voluntarily comply with the federal trade commission s green guides concerning the making of environmental claims in marketing materials 
nevertheless  our failure or the failure of our suppliers  bottlers  distributors or third party service providers to comply with federal  state  provincial or local laws  rules or regulations could subject us to potential governmental enforcement action for violation of such regulations  which could result in warning letters  fines  product recalls or seizures  civil or criminal penalties and or temporary or permanent injunctions  each of which could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our failure  or even our perceived failure  to comply with applicable laws  rules or regulations could cause retailers and others to determine not to do business with us or reduce the amount of business they do with us 
there can be no assurance that we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations to which we and our products are subject 
if we fail to comply  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and reputation 

table of contents litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities  including product liability claims  occupy a significant amount of our management s time and attention and damage our reputation 
we are from time to time party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings 
we evaluate these claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate  if possible  the amount of potential losses 
if our products are not properly manufactured or designed  personal injuries or property damage could result  which could subject us to claims for damages 
the costs associated with defending product liability and other claims  and the payment of damages  could be substantial 
our reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims  whether or not successful 
we are currently party to various legal and other proceedings 
in particular  a putative class action has been filed against us in response to certain disclosures we have made in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
see item  legal proceedings 
these matters may involve substantial expense to us and occupy a significant amount of our management s time and attention  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations 
in addition  there could be an increase in the scope of these matters and there could be additional lawsuits  claims  proceedings or investigations in the future 
we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation 
we may establish reserves as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies 
we base our assessments  estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment 
actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates 
actual settlements  judgments or resolutions of these claims or proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance 
a successful claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our inability to protect our intellectual property  or our involvement in damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation  could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition or result in the loss of use of products or services 
we have filed certain patent applications and trademark registration applications and intend to seek additional patents  to develop additional trademarks and seek federal registrations for such trademarks and to develop other intellectual property 
we consider our primo name and related trademarks and our other intellectual property to be valuable to our business  including the establishment of a national branded bottled water exchange program 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other arrangements to protect our proprietary rights and could incur substantial expense to enforce our rights under such laws 
a number of other companies  however  use trademarks similar or identical to the primo mark to identify their products  and we may not be able to stop these other companies from using such trademarks 
the requirement to change any of our trademarks  service marks or trade names could entail significant expense and result in the loss of any goodwill associated with that trademark  service mark or trade name 
while we have filed  and intend to file in the future  patent applications  where appropriate  and to pursue such applications with the patent authorities  we cannot be sure that patents will be issued on such applications or that any issued patents will not be successfully contested by third parties 
also  since issuance of a patent does not prevent other companies from using alternative  non infringing technology or designs  we cannot be sure that any issued patents  or patents that may be issued to others and licensed to us  will provide significant or any commercial protection  especially as new competitors enter the market 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets and other non patented proprietary information relating to our product development  business processes and operating activities 
we seek to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy  including confidentiality agreements 
we cannot be sure that these efforts will be successful or that confidentiality agreements will not be breached 
we also cannot be sure that we would have adequate remedies for any breach of such agreements or other misappropriation of our trade secrets  or that our trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others 
our failure to successfully develop intellectual property  or to successfully obtain  maintain and enforce patents  trademarks and other intellectual property  could affect our ability to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and could cause our sales to suffer 

table of contents where necessary  we may initiate litigation to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights 
any such litigation may require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from its day to day operations 
moreover  there is no assurance that we will be successful in any such litigation or that such litigation will not result in successful counterclaims or challenges to the validity of our intellectual property rights 
our business and our ability to provide products and services may be impaired by claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights characterize the consumer products industry 
these traits can result in significant  protracted and materially expensive litigation 
in addition  parties making infringement and other claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our products  services or utilize our business methods and could cause us to pay substantial damages 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement  we may need to obtain one or more licenses from third parties  which may not be available at a reasonable cost  or at all 
it is possible that our intellectual property rights may not be valid or that we may infringe existing or future proprietary rights of others 
any successful infringement claims could subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms  prevent us from manufacturing or selling products  providing services and utilizing business methods and require us to redesign or  in the case of trademark claims  re brand our company  products or services  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the three and five gallon polycarbonate plastic bottles that we use to bottle our water and sell in connection with our exchange business contain bisphenol a bpa  a chemical that can possibly have adverse health effects on consumers  particularly young children 
any significant change in state  provincial or federal legislation  government regulation or perception by our customers of polycarbonate plastic in food and beverage products could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
our three and five gallon polycarbonate plastic bottles contain bpa 
the use of bpa in food packaging materials has been subject to safety assessments by several international  federal and state authorities 
as per the march  fda ruling  the food and drug administration s assessment is that the scientific evidence at this time does not suggest that the very low levels of human exposure to bpa through the diet are unsafe 
the most appropriate course of action at this time is to continue scientific study and review of all new evidence regarding the safety of bpa 
health canada food directorate has concluded that the current dietary exposure to bpa through food packaging uses is not expected to pose a health risk to the general population  including newborns and infants 
however  due to the uncertainty raised in some animal studies relating to the potential effects of low levels of bpa  the government of canada is taking action to enhance the protection of infants and young children 
it is therefore recommended that the general principle of alara as low as reasonably achievable be applied to continue efforts on limiting bpa exposure from food packaging applications to infants and newborns  specifically from pre packaged infant formula products as a sole source food and baby bottles  for this sensitive segment of the population 
media reports and the fda report have prompted concern in our marketplace among existing and potential customers 
it is possible that developments surrounding this issue could lead to adverse effects on our business 
such developments could include increased publicity that changes public or regulatory perception regarding packaging that uses bpa  so that significant numbers of consumers stop purchasing products that are packaged in polycarbonate plastic  the emergence of new scientific evidence that suggests that the low doses of bpa to which consumers may be exposed when using polycarbonate plastic is unsafe  interpretations of existing evidence by the fda or other regulatory agencies that lead to prohibitions on the use of polycarbonate plastic as packaging for consumable products  
table of contents the listing of bpa by california s office of environmental health hazard assessment on the state s proposition list  which would require us to label our products with information about bpa content and could obligate us to evaluate the levels of exposure to bpa associated with the use of our products  and the inability of sellers of consumable products to find an adequate supply of alternative packaging if polycarbonate plastic containing bpa becomes an undesirable or prohibited packaging material 
in addition  federal  state  provincial and local governmental authorities have and continue to introduce  and in certain states and provinces enact proposals intended to restrict or ban the use of bpa in food and beverage packaging materials 
if any of these events were to occur  our sales and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
legislative and executive action in state and local governments enacting local taxes on bottled water to include multi gallon bottled water could adversely affect our business and financial results 
regulations have been enacted or proposed in some localities where we operate to enact local taxes on bottled water 
these actions are purportedly designed to discourage the use of bottled water due in large part to concerns about the environmental effects of producing and discarding large numbers of plastic bottles 
while we have not to date directly experienced any adverse effects from these concerns  and we believe that our products are sufficiently different from those affected by recent enactments  there is no assurance that our products will not be subject to future legislative and executive action by state and local governments  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
changes in taxation requirements could affect our financial results 
we are subject to income tax in the numerous jurisdictions in which we generate net sales 
in addition  our water dispensers we sell are subject to certain import duties and sales taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate 
increases in income and other tax rates could reduce our after tax income from affected jurisdictions  while increases in indirect taxes could affect our products and services affordability and therefore reduce demand for our products and services 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards in the united states may be limited 
as of december   we had net operating losses of approximately million for federal income tax purposes  which expire at various dates through to the extent available and not otherwise utilized  we intend to use any net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the us corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone certain changes in stock ownership 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited  under this section or otherwise  in the future 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited  our income could be subject to us corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  which could result in lower profits 
risks relating to our common stock the value of our common stock could be volatile 
the overall market and the price of our common stock may fluctuate greatly 
shares of our common stock were sold in our november initial public offering at a price of per share  and  as of march   our common stock has subsequently traded as high as and as low as per share 
an active  liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained  which could depress the trading price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors  including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  
table of contents changes in investors and analysts perception of the business risks and conditions of our business  our ability to meet the earnings estimates and other performance expectations of financial analysts or investors  unfavorable commentary or downgrades of our stock by equity research analysts  and general economic or political conditions 
future sales of our common stock  or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur  may depress our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
additionally  we have filed a shelf registration statement with the sec pursuant to which we may sell common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  rights and units at any time in one or more offerings up to a total public offering price of million 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january  the offer or sale of all or a portion of the above described securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers  directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
as of march   our executive officers  directors and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
in particular  billy d 
prim  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of march  as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
we currently have research coverage by four securities and industry analysts 
if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval  and which may include super voting  special approval  dividend  or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock  
table of contents eliminate the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent in most circumstances  eliminate the ability of our stockholders to remove a member of our board of directors without cause  eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make  alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws  and establish a classified board of directors the members of which serve staggered three year terms 
as a delaware corporation  we are also subject to provisions of delaware law  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents some stockholders holding more than of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 
these anti takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company  including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous  or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could result in a restatement of our financial statements  cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our company and have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company 
as a public company  we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or section  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management attention from other matters that are important to our business 
we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our company  which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock  and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the future  which in turn could impact our ability to raise additional financing if needed in the future 
risks relating to our indebtedness restrictive covenants in our senior revolving credit facility and term loan restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions  which could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks 
we have a million senior revolving credit facility the senior revolving credit facility with td bank  na and million term loan the term loan with comvest capital ii  lp our senior revolving credit facility and term loan contain various restrictive covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries ability to take certain actions 
in particular  these agreements limit our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  
table of contents make restricted payments including paying dividends on  redeeming or repurchasing capital stock  make certain expenditures  investments or acquisitions  create liens on our assets to secure debt  make certain prepayments without penalties  engage in certain types of transactions with affiliates  apply the proceeds of certain debt and equity financing transactions at our discretion  engage in sale and leaseback or similar transactions  and transfer or sell assets  merge  liquidate or wind up 
any or all of these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations 
any future debt could also contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those to be imposed under our senior revolving credit facility and term loan 
a breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a default under that instrument and  due to customary cross default and cross acceleration provisions  could result in a default under any other debt instrument that we may have 
if the lenders under our indebtedness were to so accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness  in which event we likely would seek reorganization or protection under bankruptcy or other  similar laws 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations 
in addition  our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to support operations and other activities without debt financing could prevent future growth and success 
our ability to generate cash  make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance 
our financial and operating performance  cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell material assets or operations  obtain additional capital or restructure our debt  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us  or at all  that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion  business acquisition plans and general operating activities  and are unable obtain the necessary funding for these items through debt financing  our business could be negatively affected and we may be unable to expand into existing and new markets 
our ability to generate cash flows is dependent in part upon obtaining necessary financing at favorable interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions may prevent us from doing so 
global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity  increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers  bottlers  distributors and customers 
the global capital and credit markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption in recent years  making it more difficult for companies to access those markets 
there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing 
our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers  bottlers  distributors or retail customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy

overview primo water corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries  primo  we  our  us is a leading provider of multi gallon purified bottled water  self serve filtered drinking water and water dispensers sold through major retailers in the united states and canada 
we believe the market for purified water is growing due to evolving taste preferences  perceived health benefits and concerns regarding the quality of municipal tap water 
our products provide an environmentally friendly  economical  convenient and healthy solution for consuming purified and filtered water 
we are a delaware corporation that was founded in and is headquartered in winston salem  north carolina 
our business is designed to generate recurring demand for our purified bottled water or self serve filtered drinking water through the sale of innovative water dispensers 
this business strategy is commonly referred to as razor razorblade because the initial sale of a product creates a base of users who frequently purchase complementary consumable products 
we believe dispenser owners consume an average of multi gallon bottles of water annually 
once our bottled water is consumed using a water dispenser  empty bottles are exchanged at our recycling center displays  which provide a recycling ticket that offers a discount toward the purchase of a new bottle of primo purified water exchange or they are refilled at a self serve filtered drinking water location refill 
each of our multi gallon water bottles can be sanitized and reused up to times before being taken out of use  crushed and recycled  substantially reducing landfill waste compared to consumption of equivalent volumes of single serve bottled water 
as of december   our products and services were offered in each of the contiguous united states and in canada at approximately  combined retail locations  including lowe s home improvement  walmart  kmart  meijer  kroger  food lion  h e b grocery  sobeys and walgreens 
we provide major retailers throughout the united states and canada with single vendor solutions for exchange and refill services  addressing a market demand that we believe was previously unmet 
our solutions are easy for retailers to implement  require minimal management supervision and store based labor  and provide centralized billing and detailed performance reports 
our exchange solution offers retailers attractive financial margins and the ability to optimize typically unused retail space with our displays 
our refill solution provides filtered water through the installation and servicing of reverse osmosis water filtration systems in the back room of the retailer s store location  which minimizes the usage of the customer s retail space 
the refill vending machine  which is typically accompanied by a sales display containing empty reusable bottles  is located within the retailer customer s floor space 
additionally  due to the recurring nature of water consumption  retailers benefit from year round customer traffic and highly predictable revenue 
business segments at december   we had two operating segments and two reportable segments primo water water and primo dispensers dispensers 
our water segment sales consist of our exchange and refill services  which are offered through retailers in each of the contiguous united states and canada 
our water services are offered through point of purchase display racks or self serve filtered water vending displays and recycling centers that are prominently located at major retailers in space that is often underutilized 
our dispensers segment sells water dispensers that are designed to dispense primo and other dispenser compatible bottled water 
our dispensers sales are primarily generated through major us retailers and are sold primarily through a direct import model  where we recognize revenues for the sale of the water dispensers when title is transferred 
we support retail sell through with domestic inventory 
we design  market and arrange for certification and inspection of our water dispensers 

table of contents during  we committed to a plan to sell the assets related to the sparkling beverage appliances  flavor concentrates  co cylinders and accessories sold under the flavorstation brand the disposal group and as a result  we are no longer reporting flavorstation as a separate business segment and current and prior year amounts and disclosures reflect these operations as discontinued operations 
in  the income and expenses associated with the sale of our flavorstation home beverage appliances  flavor concentrates  co cylinders and accessories as well as the results of the omnifrio single serve beverage business acquired in were reported in other 
the amounts included in other include the sale of inventory that does not relate to water or dispensers 
we evaluate the financial results of these segments focusing primarily on segment net sales and segment income loss from operations before depreciation and amortization segment income loss from operations 
we utilize segment net sales and segment income loss from operations because we believe they provide useful information for effectively allocating our resources between business segments  evaluating the health of our business segments based on metrics that management can actively influence and gauging our investments and our ability to service  incur or pay down debt 
cost of sales for water consists of costs for distribution  bottles and related packaging materials for our exchange services and servicing and material costs for our refill services 
cost of sales for dispensers consists of contract manufacturing  freight and duties 
selling  general and administrative expenses for water and dispensers consist primarily of personnel costs for sales  marketing  operations support and customer service  as well as other supporting costs for operating each segment 
expenses not specifically related to operating segments are shown separately as corporate 
corporate expenses are comprised mainly of compensation and other related expenses for corporate support  information systems and administration 
corporate expenses also include certain professional fees and expenses and compensation of our board of directors 
in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  when we refer to same store unit growth for our water segment  we are comparing retail locations at which our exchange services have been available for at least months at the beginning of the relevant period 
in addition  gross margin percentage is defined as net sales less cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales 
recent developments goodwill impairment effective october   we performed the annual impairment test of our goodwill 
the first step of the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit that carries goodwill to its carrying value 
as of our impairment testing date  the water reporting unit was the only reporting unit carrying goodwill 
the fair value is estimated based on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  future cash flows and the market approach 
based on the results of step one of the impairment test  we determined that our water reporting unit had a carrying value higher than its estimated fair value 
we performed the second step of impairment test which required us to compare the implied value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we had to determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired the reporting unit in an arm s length transaction as of the testing date 
we performed this analysis by deducting the estimated fair value of all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
because the recorded amount of goodwill exceeded the amount of goodwill that would have been recorded under the second step as of the impairment testing date  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million for the water reporting unit  representing a full impairment 
the impairment was primarily the result of placing greater weight on the market valuation approach 
the sustained decrease in our stock price relative to our book value resulted in placing a greater weight on the market approach in determining the fair value of the water reporting unit compared to our annual and interim impairment tests 

table of contents effective june   we performed a step one interim impairment test of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated impairment might have occurred 
the factor deemed by management to have constituted a potential impairment triggering event was the sustained decrease in our stock price relative to our book value 
this test was performed for each of our reporting units that carried goodwill as of the testing date water and the disposal group 
the disposal group is now reported as discontinued operations 
see below under discontinued operations for further discussion of the impairment recorded for the disposal group 
based on the results of the step one test we determined that our water reporting unit had a carrying value higher than its estimated fair value 
we performed the second step of the impairment test following the same approach described for our annual test and recorded an million non cash goodwill impairment charge 
the results of our impairment test for the other identifiable intangible assets of the disposal group are described below under discontinued operations 
discontinued operations during  we committed to a plan to sell the assets of the disposal group and initiated an active program to execute this plan 
in addition  we determined that the disposal group met all of the criteria for classification as discontinued operations 
as a result  current and prior year amounts and disclosures reflect these operations as discontinued operations 
effective june   we performed goodwill and other intangible asset impairment tests 
in addition to the sustained decrease in our stock price relative to our book value  we noted that delays in product development and manufacturing of the omnifrio single serve business appliance created an indication of impairment in the related goodwill and developed technology definite lived intangible asset 
as a result of the delays  we determined that the appliance would not be available for the holiday season 
we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment of million 
the developed technology intangible asset was also considered impaired as its carrying value exceeded its undiscounted cash flows 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the developed technology intangible asset 
these impairment charges are included in the results of discontinued operations

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to depreciation on additional property and equipment from new locations and amortization for identifiable intangible assets related to our business acquisition 
impairment 
we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million for the water reporting unit for we also recorded non cash impairment charges of million related to other current assets for interest expense and other  net 
interest expense increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to increased overall debt balances and increased interest rates for our term loan compared to our prior senior revolving credit facility and to increased amortization of deferred loan costs as a result of the accelerated maturity of our prior senior revolving credit facility

table of contents liquidity and capital resources adequacy of capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of stock  the issuance of debt and borrowings under credit facilities 
while we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december   we anticipate capital expenditures to range between million and million for anticipated capital expenditures are related primarily to growth in water locations 
at december   our cash totaled million and we had approximately million in additional availability under the senior revolving credit facility 
this availability is subject to borrowing base requirements related to our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  availability under the senior revolving credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our needs for general corporate purposes for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now anticipated and will depend on many factors including the rate of growth in new water locations and related display and rack costs  cost to develop new dispenser product lines  sales and marketing resources needed to further penetrate our markets  the expansion of our operations in the united states and canada  the response of competitors to our solutions and products  as well as acquisitions of other businesses 
historically  we have experienced increases in our capital expenditures consistent with the growth in our operations and personnel  and we anticipate that our expenditures will continue to increase as we grow our business  subject to limits related to our term loan and senior revolving credit facility 
our ability to satisfy our obligations or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
we also believe that if we pursue any material acquisitions in the foreseeable future we will need to finance this activity through additional equity or debt financing 
changes in cash flows the following table shows the components of our cash flows for the periods presented in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities 
table of contents net cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the increase in cash flow from operations is primarily due to an decrease in cash used to fund net working capital components 
for  cash flows from operating activities include million in goodwill and other impairment charges that have no current or expected future impact on cash flows and are shown as reconciling items to net cash used in operating activities 
net cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for from million for  caused by decreases in cash used in capital expenditures 
our primary investing activities are typically capital expenditures for business acquisitions  property  equipment and bottles and include expenditures related to the installation of our recycle centers  display racks and reverse osmosis filtration systems at new water locations 
net cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million for from million for during  cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to net borrowings on our credit facilities and term loan of million  which were partially offset by debt issuance costs of million 
during  cash provided by financing activities was primarily from our issuance of common stock in connection with our secondary public offering 
net proceeds from the secondary public offering were million 
during  we had million in net borrowings under our credit facilities 
senior revolving credit facility we entered into the senior revolving credit facility on april   as amended on february   that replaced our prior senior credit facility 
the senior revolving credit facility provides for total borrowing availability of up to million  subject to borrowing base requirements related to our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and subject to a million reserve requirement 
the senior revolving credit facility has a three and one half year term and is secured either on a first priority or second priority basis by substantially all of our assets 
the term of the senior revolving credit facility may be extended up to april  so long as the maturity of the term loan as defined below is extended to at least october  at december   our outstanding balance under our senior revolving credit facility was million and we had approximately million in additional availability 
the senior revolving credit facility contains a limit on capital expenditures of million for the year ended december  and million for each year thereafter 
the limit for capital expenditures may be increased for and thereafter based upon meeting the fixed charge coverage ratio  as stipulated and defined in the senior revolving credit facility 
in addition  the senior revolving credit facility does cross default to the term loan 
term loan we entered into a credit and security agreement on april  the credit agreement pursuant to which a million term loan the term loan was provided 
the credit agreement was amended on november  to contemplate the plan to exit the flavorstation business see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements and provide for the classification of the operating results related to the disposal group as discontinued operations 
in connection with the amendment  the lender consented to our sale of inventory and other assets related to the disposal group outside the ordinary course of business 
also in connection with the amendment  we paid the lender a million fee and agreed to a higher prepayment penalty 
in addition  the amendment adjusted certain financial covenants to correspond with our continuing water and dispenser businesses effective september  interest on outstanding amounts owed under the term loan is payable at the rate of per annum in cash plus per annum which will be paid by increasing the outstanding principal balance owed rather than being paid in cash on a current basis 

table of contents the outstanding balance of the term loan is due and payable in a single installment on april   subject to prepayment in specified circumstances  including sales or dispositions of assets outside the ordinary course of business and sales of equity or debt securities by the company 
the term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets on either a first priority or second priority basis 
the first priority assets consist of substantially all of the assets related to our refill services business 
the security interest in all of our other assets is subordinate to the security interest securing the senior revolving credit facility 
at december   our outstanding balance under our term loan was million 
the term loan contains the following financial covenants i a limit on capital expenditures of million for the year ended december  and million for each year thereafter  ii an increasing minimum adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda threshold that is measured at the end of each quarter  iii a decreasing total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio that is measured at the end of each quarter  and iv a requirement that the gross profit of our refill services business for the trailing month period measured at the end of each quarter be no less than million 
total costs associated with the term loan were million  which were capitalized and will be amortized as part of interest expense over the term of the debt 
at december  we were in compliance of all covenants  including the following the minimum adjusted ebitda threshold was million and our adjusted ebitda was million for the twelve months ended december   the total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio was and our ratio was and our refill services gross profit was million for the twelve months ended december  interest on outstanding amounts owed will be adjusted to per annum all payable in cash if and when our adjusted ebitda is million or greater for a trailing month period 
adjusted ebitda us gaap reconciliation adjusted ebitda is a non usgaap financial measure that is calculated as earnings loss before income tax expense benefit  interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  goodwill and other impairment  non cash stock based compensation expense  non recurring and acquisition related costs  loss gain on disposal of assets and other 
our term loan contains financial covenants that use adjusted ebitda 
we believe adjusted ebitda provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
management uses adjusted ebitda to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes 
adjusted ebitda is also presented to our board of directors 
non gaap measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted ebitda excludes significant expenses that are required by gaap to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations 
in addition  other companies in our industry may calculate this non us gaap measure differently than we do or may not calculate it at all  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

additionally  we are not a party to any derivative contracts or synthetic leases 
inflation during the last three years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
seasonality  fluctuations of results we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and operating income 
our sales and operating income have been highest in the spring and summer and lowest in the fall and winter 
our water segment  which generally enjoys higher margins than our dispensers segment  experiences higher sales and operating income in the spring and summer 
our dispensers segment had historically experienced higher sales and operating income in spring and summer  however  we believe the seasonality of this segment will be more dependent on retailer inventory management and purchasing cycles and not correlated to weather 
sustained periods of poor weather  particularly in the spring and summer  can negatively impact our sales in our higher margin water segment 
accordingly  our results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a year or any future quarter 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable  based on information available at the time they are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our consolidated financial statements may be affected 
some of the more significant estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  depreciation  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill  valuation of deferred taxes and allowance for sales returns 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized for the sale of multi gallon purified bottled water upon either the delivery of inventory to the retail store or the purchase by the consumer 
revenue is either recognized as an exchange transaction where a discount is provided on the purchase of a multi gallon bottle of purified water for the return of an empty multi gallon bottle or a non exchange transaction 
revenues on exchange transactions are recognized net of the exchange discount 
self serve filtered water revenue is recognized as the water is filtered  which is measured by the water dispensing equipment meter 
revenue is recognized for the sale of our water dispenser products when title is transferred to our retail customers 
we have no contractual obligation to accept returns nor do we guarantee sales 
however  we will at times accept returns or issue credits for manufacturer defects or that were damaged in transit 
revenues are recognized net of an estimated allowance for returns using an average return rate based upon historical experience 
in addition  we offer certain incentives such as coupons and rebates that are netted against and reduce net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
with the purchase of certain of our water dispensers we include a coupon for a free multi gallon bottle of purified water 
no revenue is recognized with respect to the redemption of the coupon for a free multi gallon bottle of water and the estimated cost of the multi gallon bottle of purified water is included in cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our retail customers inability to pay us 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
judgments are made with respect to the collectability of accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic trends 
these amounts are continuously monitored as additional information is obtained 
any material change in our customers business or cash flows would affect our ability to collect amounts due 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability  whether in use or under development 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we classify intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and goodwill 
we determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset 
factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset  the historical performance of the asset  our long term strategy for using the asset  any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset  and other economic factors  including competition and specific market conditions 
intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized  primarily on a straight line basis  over their useful lives 
we test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives  including trademarks and goodwill  for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
we perform these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our fourth quarter 
we had assigned goodwill to two reporting units water and flavorstation  however the flavorstation reporting unit is now a part of the disposal group see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in evaluating reporting units  we first consider our operating segments and related components in accordance with us gaap 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value is estimated based on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  future cash flows and the market approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process is performed which compares the implied value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

table of contents we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a combination of the income approach  weighted based on the circumstances  using a discounted cash flow model  and a market approach  which considers comparable companies and transactions 
under the income approach  the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted using a rate which reflects our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant  and is adjusted for appropriate risk factors 
we perform sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach 
under the market approach  valuation multiples are derived based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions  and applied to projected operating data for each reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that utilization is not presently more likely than not 
as required by us gaap  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based employee and director compensation plans in accordance with us gaap  which requires recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements over the period the employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award presumptively the vesting period 
we measure the fair value of each stock option grant at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to of the fair market value per share of the common stock on the date of grant 
the options generally vest over a period of one to four years  based on graded vesting  and expire ten years from the date of grant 
the terms and conditions of the awards made under the plans vary but  in general  are at the discretion of the board of directors or its appointed committee 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury rate for the expected life at the time of grant 
as a result of our limited trading history beginning on november   our expected volatility is based on the average long term historical volatilities of peer companies 
we intend to continue to consistently use the same group of publicly traded peer companies to determine expected volatility in the future until sufficient information regarding volatility of our share price becomes available or the selected companies are no longer suitable for this purpose 
also  due to our limited trading history  we are using the simplified method to calculate expected holding periods  which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we will continue to use this method until we have sufficient historical exercise experience to give us confidence that our calculations based on such experience will be reliable 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our current intent not to issue dividends 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued accounting guidance which requires companies to present total comprehensive income and its components and the components of net income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive statements reporting net income and comprehensive income 
this requirement eliminates the option to present components of comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
this guidance affects only the presentation of comprehensive income and does not change the components of comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb further amended this guidance to indefinitely defer the effective date of the requirement to present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and in other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements 
all other provisions of this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  on a retrospective basis 
we have elected to present two consecutive statements reporting net income and comprehensive income and have reflected the necessary changes in these financial statements 
indefinite lived intangible assets in july  the fasb issued updated guidance concerning the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this guidance allows an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test described in the existing guidance 
if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment  it shall assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if after assessing relevant events and circumstances an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  the entity shall calculate the fair value of the asset and perform the quantitative impairment test described in the existing guidance 
these amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
the amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in february  the fasb issued updated guidance which requires companies to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  companies are required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
for public entities  the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the information required by item a is not required to be provided by issuers that satisfy the definition of smaller reporting company under sec rules
