part i item business overview dynavax technologies corporation we  our  us  dynavax or the company  a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  discovers and develops novel products to prevent and treat infectious and inflammatory diseases 
our lead product candidate is heplisav tm  a phase investigational adult hepatitis b vaccine 
on february   dynavax announced that it had received a complete response letter crl from the us food and drug administration fda or agency regarding its biologic license application bla for heplisav 
in the crl  the fda specified that the indication in adults years of age cannot be approved without further evaluation of safety in this broad age group 
the fda also expressed concern that novel adjuvants may cause rare autoimmune events  however  the agency indicated its willingness to continue discussions with us regarding a more restricted use of heplisav 
the fda also requested additional data from our process validation program as well as clarifying information on the manufacturing controls and facilities with respect to quality assurance of commercial product 
dynavax believes it can provide the information but the exact timeframe for its response cannot be determined until a meeting with the agency occurs 
we plan to meet with the fda in the near term to discuss the crl and the steps necessary for potential approval of heplisav 
dynavax s bla was accepted for review by the fda in june on november   the fda s vaccines and related biological products advisory committee committee voted to with abstention that there was insufficient data to adequately support the safety of heplisav 

table of contents dynavax s marketing authorization application maa for heplisav continues to be under review in europe 
our pipeline of product candidates includes heplisav  our autoimmune program partnered with glaxosmithkline gsk and our therapy for asthma partnered with astrazeneca ab astrazeneca 
we compete with pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions and research organizations in developing therapies to prevent or treat infectious and inflammatory diseases 
our product candidates are based on our proprietary technology which uses immunostimulatory and immunoregulatory sequences 
the company and background we were incorporated in california in august under the name double helix corporation  and we changed our name to dynavax technologies corporation in september we reincorporated in delaware in dynavax technologies corporation is listed on the nasdaq capital market under the ticker symbol dvax

proprietary technology immunostimulatory sequences immunostimulatory sequences iss are short deoxyribonucleic acid dna sequences that enhance the ability of the immune system to fight disease 
iss activate the innate immune response by specifically targeting toll like receptor tlr  which is found on a specialized subset of immune cells 
iss work by changing or reprogramming the immune responses that cause disease rather than just by treating the symptoms of the disease 
since tlr is found exclusively in a specialized subset of dendritic cells  iss do not cause a generalized activation of the immune system and redirect the response of only those t cells involved in a given disease 
when linked to or combined with antigens  iss help generate memory t helper th cells that can reprogram the immune system to induce long lasting therapeutic effects 
we have developed a number of proprietary iss compositions and formulations that make use of the different ways in which the innate immune system responds to iss 
depending on the indication for which iss is being explored as a therapy  we use iss in different ways 
immunostimulatory sequences linked to or combined with antigens for prevention of infectious diseases  iss can be linked to or combined with antigens to increase the visibility of the antigen and stimulate an immune response that will attack and destroy infected or abnormal cells 
this treatment induces a highly specific th immune response and generates memory t cells for long term protection 
this treatment has the potential to be used synergistically with other therapies 

table of contents immunostimulatory sequences alone for treatment of viral and respiratory diseases  iss can be used alone to modify the course of the disease by reprogramming the immune system 
iss suppress the th inflammatory response caused by any number of allergens to modify the underlying cause of inflammation as well as provide symptomatic relief 
advanced immunostimulatory sequences technologies for several programs  we have used our advanced proprietary knowledge to design modifications of the molecular structure of iss to significantly increase their versatility and potency  allowing use of less iss 
these second generation iss stimulate specific immune responses  including potent interferon alpha induction 
immunoregulatory sequences immunoregulatory sequences irs are short dna sequences that specifically inhibit tlrs associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
tlrs are key receptors of the innate immune system that can induce strong inflammatory responses 
in animal studies as well as in vitro  our tlr inhibitors have demonstrated broad potential in multiple autoimmune disease models  such as lupus  inflammatory skin disorders and rheumatoid arthritis 
development programs our pipeline of product candidates includes the following product candidate clinical indication s phase partnership funding support heplisav hepatitis b prevention phase dynavax dv autoimmune and inflammatory diseases phase gsk azd asthma preclinical astrazeneca heplisav hepatitis b vaccine heplisav is an investigational adult hepatitis b vaccine 
in phase trials  heplisav demonstrated higher and earlier protection with fewer doses than currently licensed vaccines 
dynavax has worldwide commercial rights to heplisav 
heplisav combines our first generation iss   iss with hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag manufactured in our dynavax facility in d sseldorf  germany rhein or dynavax europe 
on february   dynavax announced that it had received a crl from the fda regarding its bla for heplisav 
in the crl  the fda specified that the indication in adults years of age cannot be approved without further evaluation of safety in this broad age group 
the fda also expressed concern that novel adjuvants may cause rare autoimmune events  however  the agency indicated its willingness to continue discussions with us regarding a more restricted use of heplisav 
the fda also requested additional data from dynavax s process validation program as well as clarifying information on the manufacturing controls and facilities with respect to quality assurance of commercial product 
dynavax believes it can provide the information but the exact timeframe for its response cannot be determined until a meeting with the agency occurs 
we plan to meet with the fda in the near term to discuss the crl and the steps necessary for potential approval of heplisav 
dynavax s bla was accepted for review by the fda in june on november   the fda s vaccines and related biological products advisory committee committee voted to with abstention that there was insufficient data to adequately support the safety of heplisav  although the committee voted to that heplisav data adequately demonstrated immunogenicity

commercial opportunity hepatitis b can be a chronic disease which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver  hepatocellular carcinoma and death 
there is no cure for hepatitis b  and disease prevention through effective vaccines is critical to reducing the spread of the disease 
available hepatitis b vaccines for adults have several limitations  including slow onset of protection the current regimen for adults is usually doses given over months to provide seroprotection of approximately  and after the first  second and third doses respectively  poor protection in populations that are hypo responders current vaccines provide a lower seroprotection rate for persons over years of age including males  the obese  smokers  diabetics and immunocompromised persons  such as end stage renal disease patients  and poor compliance in certain settings only of people receive all doses 
heplisav is designed to address the limitations of currently licensed vaccines by providing higher and earlier protection with fewer doses 
we estimate the total worldwide market for adult hepatitis b vaccines approximates million annually 
this market is primarily comprised of gsk s engerix b and twinrix as well as merck co 
s merck recombivax hb 
key market segments consisting of persons considered to be at high risk for hepatitis b virus hbv infection include chronic kidney disease patients  people with multiple sexual partners or injection drug use  healthcare workers and first responders  travelers  chronic liver disease patients and people with diabetes mellitus type and type 
dv irs for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases our irs program is focused on novel inhibitors of tlr  tlr and tlr for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  under a worldwide strategic alliance with gsk 
in late  we initiated a proof of mechanism clinical trial of dv  a bifunctional inhibitor of tlr and tlr  in systemic lupus erythematosus patients 
gsk has an exclusive option to obtain a license to this program following completion of this trial 
we also are developing inhibitors of tlr for the treatment of multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in this collaboration 
the activation of tlr in myeloid cells yields the production of multiple pro inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factors  interleukin  interleukin and interleukin azd asthma therapy we are developing azd  a novel candidate drug for asthma  under our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca 
azd utilizes our proprietary second generation iss and represents a new approach to the treatment of allergic respiratory diseases 
azd is designed to change the basic immune response to environmental allergens  such as house dust and pollens  leading to prolonged reduction in asthma symptoms 
we are preparing to advance azd into phase clinical trials after completion of remaining preclinical activities 
pharmaceutical partnerships and other funding agreements our objective is to discover novel therapies based on our proprietary technologies and develop a diversified pipeline of product candidates to build a product based commercial business 
to reach this objective  an important part of our strategy is to establish partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies and enter into funding agreements 
our pharmaceutical partners provide valuable resources  expertise and abilities that allow us to further advance the development of our product candidate programs 
we also have funding agreements with us government institutions 

table of contents glaxosmithkline in december  we entered into a worldwide strategic alliance with gsk to discover  develop and commercialize tlr inhibitors 
we received an initial payment of million and agreed to conduct research and early clinical development in up to four programs 
in  we earned million in milestone payments for the initiation of phase and proof of mechanism clinical trials of dv in systemic lupus erythematosus patients and expansion of our collaboration with gsk to develop a tlr inhibitor 
we are eligible to receive future development milestone payments which we have determined to be substantive milestones 
gsk can exercise its exclusive option to license each program upon achievement of certain events and we are eligible to receive contingent option exercise payments 
if gsk exercises an option  gsk would carry out further development and commercialization of the corresponding products 
we are eligible to receive tiered  up to double digit royalties on sales of any products originating from the collaboration and have retained an option to co develop and co promote one product under this agreement 
absent early termination  the agreement will expire when all of gsk s payment obligations expire 
either party may terminate the agreement early upon written notice if the other party commits an uncured material breach of the agreement 
either party may terminate the agreement in the event of insolvency of the other party 
gsk also has the option to terminate the agreement without cause upon prior written notice within a specified window of time dependent upon the stage of clinical development of the programs 
astrazeneca ab in september  we entered into a three year research collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca for the discovery and development of tlr agonist based therapies for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for which we received an upfront payment of million 
in  we received a milestone payment of million for the nomination of the first candidate drug  azd  for asthma 
the research term of this agreement was extended through july in october  we amended our agreement with astrazeneca to provide that we will conduct initial clinical development of azd under the terms of the amended agreement  astrazeneca will fund all program expenses to cover the cost of development activities through phase a 
we and astrazeneca have agreed to advance azd towards a phase clinical trial  which resulted in a development funding payment of million  received in the fourth quarter of if astrazeneca chooses to advance the program following completion of phase a  we will receive a million milestone payment and astrazeneca will retain its rights to develop the candidate therapy and to commercialize the resulting asthma product 
additionally  we are eligible to receive potential future development payments and  upon commercialization  we are eligible to receive royalties based on product sales of any products originating from the collaboration 
we have the option to co promote in the united states products arising from the collaboration  if any 
astrazeneca has the right to sublicense its rights upon our prior consent 
absent early termination  the agreement will expire when all of astrazeneca s payment obligations expire 
astrazeneca has the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon prior written notice and either party may terminate the agreement early upon written notice if the other party commits an uncured material breach of the agreement 
national institutes of health and other funding in september  we were awarded a million contract to develop our advanced iss technology using tlr agonists as vaccine adjuvants 
this five year contract was awarded by the national institute of health s nih national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid and supports adjuvant development for biodefense vaccines  including anthrax as well as other diseases 
niaid is funding of the total million cost of our program under contract no 
hhsnc 
the nih may terminate performance of work under the contract if the contracting officer determines that a termination is in the government s interest or if we default in performing and fail to cure after notice 

table of contents during  we were awarded a grant from the niaid to take a systems biology approach to study the differences between individuals who do or do not respond to vaccination against hepatitis b 
this study will be one of several projects conducted under a grant to the baylor institute of immunology research in dallas as part of the human immune phenotyping centers program  from which we were awarded million in  million in and million in we were also awarded a million grant in from the nih to explore the feasibility of developing a universal vaccine to prevent infection by human papilloma virus 
during  we were awarded a million grant from the nih that will be used to fund research to characterize the role of the phosphoinositide kinase in preclinical models of skin autoimmune inflammation 
during  we were awarded a million grant from the nih to fund research in screening for inhibitors of tlr for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and a million grant to fund development of tlr inhibitors for treatment of autoimmune diseases 
intellectual property our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates  technology and know how  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
in addition to seeking patent protection in the united states  we generally file patent applications in australia  canada  japan  western european countries and additional foreign countries on a selective basis to further protect the inventions that we or our partners consider important to the development of our business 
we also rely on trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information 
as of december   our intellectual property portfolio included issued us patents  over issued or granted foreign patents and over additional pending us and foreign patent applications claiming compositions and formulations of iss and irs  their methods of use or processes for their manufacture 
we also have exclusive licenses under two agreements to several patents and applications owned by the regents of the university of california 
we have an issued us patent covering the iss contained in our heplisav investigational vaccine that will expire in  unless extended  and corresponding issued patents in several major european and other countries 
we own or have an exclusive license to us and foreign patent applications pending for each of our other product candidates and or their uses 
at present  it is not known or determinable whether patents will issue from any of these applications or what the specific expiration dates would be for any patents that do issue 
individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained 
generally  patents issued in the united states are effective for the longer of years from the issue date or years from the earliest effective filing date  if the patent application was filed prior to june   and years from the earliest effective filing date  if the patent application was filed on or after june  in addition  in certain instances  a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the fda regulatory review period 
the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law  but typically is years from the earliest effective filing date 
our patent estate  based on patents existing now and expected by us to issue based on pending applications  will expire on dates ranging from to 
table of contents the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis  from country to country and depends upon many factors  including the type of patent  the scope of its coverage  the availability of regulatory related extensions  the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents 
because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions typically are not published until months after filing and publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications 
the us patent and trademark office pto may declare interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications and those of other parties or reexamination or reissue proceedings to determine if the scope of a patent should be narrowed 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
a number of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  including pfizer  inc pfizer  as well as universities and research institutions  may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover inventions similar to the inventions owned or licensed to us 
we cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to make  use or sell any products 
if another party controls patents or patent applications covering our products  we may not be able to obtain the rights we need to those patents or patent applications in order to commercialize our products 
two of our potential competitors  merck and gsk  are exclusive licensees of broad patents covering recombinant hbsag  a component of heplisav 
in addition  the institut pasteur also owns or has exclusive licenses to patents covering hbsag 
while some of these patents have expired or will soon expire outside the united states  they remain in force in the united states 
to the extent we are able to commercialize heplisav in the united states while these patents remain in force  merck  gsk  their licensors or the institut pasteur may bring claims against us 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of another party s proprietary rights 
the existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
for example  pfizer has issued us and foreign patent claims as well as patent claims pending with the pto and foreign patent offices that  if held to be valid  could require us to obtain a license in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss other than with respect to heplisav  for which we have a license 
litigation or any other proceedings  such as patent interferences  could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us  and an adverse outcome in a court or patent office could subject us to significant liabilities  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties  or require us to cease using some of our technology 
we may not prevail of these actions or proceedings  if any 
in addition  other parties may duplicate  design around or independently develop similar or alternative technologies to ours or our licensors 
we may rely  in some circumstances  on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology 
although trade secrets are difficult to protect  wherever possible  we use confidential disclosure agreements to protect the proprietary nature of our technology 
our policy is to require each of our commercial partners  employees  consultants and advisors to enter into an agreement before beginning their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with us that in general provides that the individuals must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any of our confidential information developed or learned by the individuals during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances 
these agreements also generally provide that we own all inventions conceived by the individuals in the course of rendering their employment or services to us 
however  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets and or proprietary information will not otherwise 
table of contents become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us  disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
under the terms of our license agreements with the regents of the university of california  we are required to pay license fees  make milestone payments  share a portion of fees from third party partnerships up to a specified amount and pay low single digit royalties on net sales resulting from successful products originating from the licensed technologies 
to date  we have paid the university of california a total of million in license fees  shared third party partnership fees and milestone payments under these agreements 
we estimate the total potential milestone payments payable for each such product will total approximately million  not including royalties 
we may terminate these agreements in whole or in part on days advance notice 
the regents of the university of california may terminate these agreements if we are in breach for failure to make payments  meet diligence requirements  produce required reports or fund internal research and we do not cure such breach within days after being notified of the breach 
otherwise  the agreements generally continue in effect until the last patent claiming a product licensed under the agreement or its manufacture or use expires  or in the absence of patents  until the date the last patent application claiming a licensed product is abandoned 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies  intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products 
our products and development programs target a number of areas including viral  respiratory  autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
there are many commercially available products for the treatment of these diseases 
many companies and institutions are making substantial investments in developing additional products to treat these diseases that could compete directly or indirectly with our products under development 
heplisav  a two dose hepatitis b vaccine  if approved and commercialized  will compete directly with conventional three dose marketed vaccines produced by gsk and merck  among others 
there are also modified schedules of conventional hepatitis b vaccines for limited age ranges that are approved in the european union and united states 
in addition  heplisav will compete against a number of multivalent vaccines that simultaneously protect against hepatitis b and other diseases 
our therapy for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  dv  if developed  approved and commercialized will compete with key biologic therapies from companies such as f 
hoffman la roche ltd 
and its subsidiary genentech  inc roche genentech  amgen inc  biogen idec  abbott laboratories and gsk 
in addition  our product would compete with generic drugs commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases  including corticosteroids  non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  antimalarials and immunosuppressive agents 
other companies  such as astrazeneca and its subsidiary medimmune  llc  roche genentech  idera pharmaceuticals  pfizer and ucb sa and its partner immunomedics  inc  are developing anti ifn alpha antibodies  b cell targeted antibodies  immunosuppressants  and other tlr inhibitors that may compete directly with our product candidate 
our asthma therapy  azd  if developed  approved and commercialized  will compete indirectly with existing asthma therapies  such as inhaled beta agonists  corticosteroids  leukotriene inhibitors and ige monoclonal antibodies  including those marketed by merck  roche genentech  novartis international ag  astrazeneca and gsk 
in addition  directly competing products may be in development by sanofi aventis and idera pharmaceuticals 
many of the entities developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical testing  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative agreements with large  established 
table of contents companies and access to capital 
these entities may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs 
regulatory considerations in the united states  pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to rigorous review and approval by the fda under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the public health service act and other federal statutes and regulations 
in europe  under the centralized procedure  a company submits a single application to the european medicines agency 
the steps ordinarily required by the regulatory authorities before a new drug or biological product may be marketed in the united states and in most other countries include but are not limited to the following completion of preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies and formulation studies  submission to the regulatory authority of a clinical application for a new drug or biologic which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for each proposed indication  demonstration of the consistent manufacturing of drug substance and drug product  the submission of a new drug application to the regulatory authority  and regulatory review and approval of the application before any commercial marketing  sale or shipment of the drug 
if applicable requirements are not met  regulatory authorities may issue fines  require that a company recall its products  seize products  require that a company totally or partially suspend the production of its products  refuse to approve a marketing application  pursue criminal prosecution and or revoke previously granted marketing authorizations 
to secure regulatory authority approval  we must submit extensive non clinical and clinical data  adequate evidence of a product manufactured by a well controlled process that is safe and effective for its intended use  and other supporting information to the regulatory authority 
the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for fda and foreign regulatory agency approvals varies depending on the product candidate  the disease or condition for which the product candidate is in development and regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
further  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
in addition  the development of the drug substance and drug product may require manufacturing modifications to ensure future regulatory acceptance 
the approval process takes many years  requires the expenditures of substantial resources  and involves post marketing surveillance 
delays experienced during the approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have exclusive rights to exploit patented products or technologies 
delays can occur at any stage of drug development and as a result of many factors  certain of which are not under our control  including but not limited to the following lack of efficacy  or incomplete or inconclusive results from clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  failure by investigators to adhere to protocol requirements  including patient enrollment criteria  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment  failure by subjects to comply with trial protocol requirements  
table of contents inability to follow patients adequately after treatment  inability to qualify and enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture sufficient quality and quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  failure by a contract research organization to fulfill contractual obligations  and adverse changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance 
the fda or foreign regulatory agency may also require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products 
following approval  we may be required to conduct additional post marketing studies 
the regulatory authority may withdraw product approvals if we do not continue to comply with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 
non clinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics or animal studies to assess the initial efficacy and safety of the product 
the fda or other foreign regulatory agency  under its good laboratory practices regulations  regulates certain non clinical studies 
research and preclinical studies do not involve the introduction of a product candidate in human subjects 
these activities involve identification of potential product candidates  modification of promising candidates to optimize their biological activity  as well as preclinical studies to assess safety and effectiveness in animals 
in clinical trials  the product candidate is administered to humans 
violations of these regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of those studies  requiring these studies to be repeated 
the results of these tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the regulatory authority as part of a clinical application  which must be approved by the regulatory authority before we can commence clinical investigations in humans 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
we must conduct our clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice under protocols submitted to the regulatory authority as part of the clinical application 
this includes the requirement that each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an investigational review board and with patient informed consent 
the investigational review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possibility of liability of the institution conducting the trial 
the stages of the regulatory process include clinical trials in three sequential phases that may overlap 
phase clinical trials typically involve the administration of a product candidate into a small group of healthy human subjects 
these trials are the first attempt to evaluate a drug s safety  determine a safe dose range and identify side effects 
during phase trials  the product candidate is introduced into patients who suffer from the medical condition that the product candidate is intended to treat 
phase studies are designed to evaluate whether a product candidate shows evidence of effectiveness  to further evaluate dosage  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when phase evaluations demonstrate that a product candidate appears to be both safe and effective  phase trials are undertaken to confirm a product candidate s effectiveness and to test for safety in an expanded patient population 
if the results of phase trials appear to confirm effectiveness and safety  the data gathered in all phases of clinical trials form the basis for an application for regulatory approval of the product candidate 
we and all of our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda or foreign regulatory agency current good manufacturing practice gmp regulations 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with a regulatory authority s general biological product standards 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
good manufacturing practice regulations require quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
before granting product approval  the regulatory authority must determine that our or our third 
table of contents party contractor s manufacturing facilities meet gmp requirements before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products 
in addition  our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the regulatory authority for continued compliance with gmp requirements during clinical development as well as following product approval 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda or foreign regulatory agency and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal 
if our products are approved for sale  we will be subject to further regulatory requirements under federal and state provisions such as federal sunshine laws  anti kickback laws  false claims laws and state law equivalents of those and other regulations 
we are also subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research 
we cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action 
manufacturing we rely on our facility in dusseldorf  germany and third parties to perform the multiple processes involved in manufacturing our product candidates  including iss  certain antigens  the combination of the iss and the antigens and the formulation  fill and finish of these products 
the process for manufacturing oligonucleotides such as iss is well established and uses commercially available equipment and raw materials 
we have relied on a limited number of suppliers to produce iss for clinical trials and a single supplier to produce our iss for heplisav 
to date  we have manufactured only small quantities of iss and iss ourselves for development purposes 
we currently manufacture the hbsag for heplisav at our dynavax europe facility 
research and development conducting a significant amount of research and development has been central to our business model 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
environment we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures for environmental compliance and protection 
we do not expect that expenditures for compliance with environmental laws will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or results of operations in the future 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including phds  phds and others with advanced degrees 
of the employees  were dedicated to research and development activities 
none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our relations with our employees are good

risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning our future products  product candidates  timing of development activities  regulatory strategies  intellectual property position  expenses  revenues  liquidity and cash needs  as well as our plans and strategies 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and we assume no obligation to update this information 
numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ significantly from the results described in these forward looking statements  including the following risk factors 

table of contents risks related to our business the success of our product candidates  in particular heplisav  depends on regulatory approval 
the fda or foreign regulatory agencies may determine our clinical trials or other data regarding safety  efficacy  consistency of manufacture or compliance with gmp regulations are insufficient for regulatory approval 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals could require us to discontinue operations 
none of our product candidates has been approved for sale by any regulatory agency 
any product candidate we develop is subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and foreign regulatory agencies 
our success is primarily dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our most advanced product candidates 
approval processes in the united states and in other countries are uncertain  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
for our lead product  heplisav  our bla must be approved by the fda and corresponding applications to foreign regulatory agencies must be approved by those agencies before we may sell the product in their respective geographic area 
obtaining approval of a bla by the fda and corresponding foreign applications is highly uncertain and we may fail to obtain approval 
the bla review process is extensive  lengthy  expensive and uncertain  and the fda or foreign regulatory agencies may delay  limit or deny approval of our application for many reasons  including whether the data from our clinical trials  including the phase results  or the development program is satisfactory to the fda  disagreement with the number  design  size  conduct or implementation of our clinical trials or a conclusion that the data fails to meet statistical or clinical significance  acceptability of data generated at our clinical trial sites that are monitored by third party clinical research organizations  the results of an fda or other advisory committee that may recommend against approval of our bla or may recommend that the fda or other agencies require  as a condition for approval  additional preclinical studies or clinical trials  and deficiencies in our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of our third party contract manufacturers and suppliers  if any 
for example  in our recent complete response letter from the fda received in february the complete response letter  heplisav was not approvable for the proposed indication based on insufficient patient safety data for an indication in adults years of age without further evaluation of safety in this broad age group 
the fda also expressed concern that novel adjuvants may cause rare autoimmune events 
while the agency indicated its willingness to continue discussions with us regarding a more restricted use of heplisav  there can be no assurance that further fda guidance will not require us to conduct additional clinical studies or that our data will support approval 
the fda also requested additional data from our process validation program as well as clarifying information on the manufacturing controls and facilities with respect to quality assurance of commercial product 
there can be no assurance that dynavax can successfully produce the requisite data in a timely manner 
in addition  we obtain guidance from regulatory authorities on certain aspects of our clinical development activities and seek to comply with written guidelines provided by the authorities 
these discussions and written guidelines are not binding obligations on the part of the regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities may require additional patient data or studies to be conducted 
regulatory authorities may revise or retract previous guidance during the course of a clinical trial or after completion of the trial 
the authorities may also disqualify a clinical trial from consideration in support of approval of a potential product if they deem the guidelines have not been met 
the fda or foreign regulatory agencies may determine our clinical trials or other data regarding safety  efficacy or consistency of manufacture or compliance with gmp regulations are insufficient for regulatory approval 
failure to receive approval or significant delay in being able to provide the safety and manufacturing information required for approval of our bla for heplisav based on the complete response letter from the fda would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
even if approved  the labeling approved by the relevant regulatory authority for a product may restrict to whom we and our potential partners  if any  may market the product or the manner in which our product may be administered and sold  which could significantly limit the commercial opportunity for such product 

table of contents before granting product approval  the fda must determine that our or our third party contractor s manufacturing facilities meet current gmp requirements before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products 
we and all of our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable current gmp regulations 
manufacturers of biological products must also comply with the fda s general biological product standards 
in addition  gmp regulations require quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation sufficient to ensure the quality of the approved product 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as delay of approval  suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
the fda may require more clinical trials for our product candidate than we currently expect before granting regulatory approval  if at all 
our clinical trials may be extended which may lead to substantial delays in the regulatory approval process for our product candidates  which will impair our ability to generate revenues 
our registration and commercial timelines depend on further discussions with the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies 
any extension of our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to timely and successfully commercialize or market these product candidates  result in significant additional costs  potentially diminish any competitive advantages for those products  potentially limit the markets for those products  adversely affect our ability to enter into collaborations or receive milestone payments or royalties from potential collaborators  cause us to abandon the development of the affected product candidate  or limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
heplisav and most of our earlier stage programs rely on iss based technology 
serious adverse event data relating to either iss or other iss based technology may require us to reduce the scope of or discontinue our operations 
heplisav incorporates our iss compound and most of our research and development programs use iss based technology 
if any of our product candidates in clinical trials produce serious adverse event data  we may be required to delay  discontinue or modify our clinical trials or our clinical trial strategy 
most of our clinical product candidates contain iss  and if a common safety risk across therapeutic areas were identified  it may hinder our ability to enter into potential collaboration arrangements or commercialize our product candidates 
if adverse event data are found to apply to our iss based technology as a whole  we may be required to significantly reduce or discontinue our operations 
we have no commercialization experience  and the time and resources to develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities for heplisav are significant 
if we fail to achieve and sustain commercial success for heplisav  either directly or with a partner  our business would be harmed 
although certain of our employees have commercialization experience  as a company we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
heplisav product sales are currently expected to generate a substantial portion of our future revenue  if heplisav is approved 
to commercialize heplisav  we must either develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services  which will require resources and time and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms 
if we decide to market heplisav directly  we must commit significant resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
in particular  significant resources may be necessary to successfully market  sell and distribute heplisav to patients with 
table of contents diabetes  a group recently recommended by the cdc and acip to receive hepatitis b vaccination 
moreover  our pricing and reimbursement strategies with respect to our initial approval plans for heplisav may significantly impact our ability to achieve commercial success in this potential patient population 
factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize heplisav directly or indirectly with a partner if approved include our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel  the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to administer our products  the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines  our inability to expand and sustain qualified manufacturing capacity to meet demand  in particular if there is a significant increase in demand due to the recommendation to vaccinate persons with diabetes if we should obtain approval to market to those patients  our inability to determine appropriate pricing and reimbursement strategies for heplisav in the potential patient populations that may use heplisav  particularly in the diabetes market  and possible claims against us  including enjoining sales of heplisav  based on the patent rights of others  and unanticipated delays  costs and expenses associated with manufacturing and commercialization of our products  including costs of maintaining and scaling up manufacturing capabilities and creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization in various territories 
if we  or our partners  if any  are not successful in setting our marketing  pricing and reimbursement strategy  recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure  we will have difficulty commercializing heplisav  which would adversely affect our business and financial condition 
to the extent we rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established sales  marketing and distribution systems to market heplisav  we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements  and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other arrangements  certain revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties  which may not be successful and are only partially in our control 
we rely on our facility in d sseldorf  germany and third parties to supply materials or perform processes necessary to manufacture our product candidates 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers to produce the iss we will require for commercialization 
additionally  we have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in commercial quantities 
we rely on our facility in d sseldorf and third parties to perform the multiple processes involved in manufacturing our product candidates  including iss  certain antigens  the combination of iss and the antigens  and the formulation  fill and finish 
termination or interruption of these relationships may occur due to circumstances that are outside of our control  resulting in higher cost or delays in our product development or commercialization efforts 
we have relied on a limited number of suppliers to produce iss for clinical trials and a single supplier to produce our iss for heplisav 
to date  we have manufactured only small quantities of iss and iss ourselves for development purposes 
if we were unable to maintain our existing supplier for iss  we would have to establish an alternate qualified manufacturing capability  which would result in significant additional operating costs and delays in developing and commercializing our product candidates  particularly heplisav 
we or other third parties may not be able to produce iss at a cost  quantity and quality that are available from our current third party supplier 

table of contents we currently utilize our facility in d sseldorf to manufacture the hepatitis b surface antigen for heplisav 
the commercial manufacturing of biological products is a time consuming and complex process  which must be performed in compliance with current gmp regulations 
as indicated in the complete response letter from the fda  we will be required to provide additional data from our process validation program as well as clarifying information on the manufacturing controls and facilities with respect to quality assurance of commercial product  and there can be no assurance as to the timing and if we can provide the data and information necessary to secure product approval 
in addition  we may not be able to comply with ongoing and comparable foreign regulations  and our manufacturing process may be subject to delays  disruptions or quality control quality assurance problems 
noncompliance with these regulations or other problems with our manufacturing process may limit or delay or disrupt the commercialization of heplisav and could result in significant expense 
moreover  depending on the level of market acceptance of heplisav  if approved  we may not have the capacity in our existing facility to meet all of our future commercial supply needs 
our current manufacturing capacity could supply up to approximately million doses of hepatitis b surface antigen annually  and our ability to expand d sseldorf manufacturing capacity by improving utilization in our existing facility  improving upon our current production yields or using a new facility will take time to implement and could result in substantial cost 
in the event that demand exceeds our current capacity plans  we may experience a shortage in supply of heplisav  which could have a material adverse effect on the success of heplisav 
likewise  in the event that heplisav is not approved  we would have to consider other alternatives for the facility in d sseldorf  including its sale or closure  and any such efforts would be complex  expensive  and time consuming 
if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing fda and foreign regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review 
we and our third party suppliers are required to comply with applicable current gmp regulations and other international regulatory requirements 
the regulations require that our product candidates be manufactured and our records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and quality control quality assurance activities 
suppliers of key components and materials must be named in a bla submitted to the fda for any product candidate for which we are seeking fda approval 
additionally  these third parties and our manufacturing facility must undergo a pre approval inspection before we can obtain marketing authorization for any of our product candidates 
even after a manufacturer has been qualified by the fda  the manufacturer must continue to expend time  money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with gmp 
manufacturers are subject to regular  periodic inspections by the fda following initial approval 
further  to the extent that we contract with third parties for the manufacture of our products  our ability to control third party compliance with fda requirements will be limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection 
if  as a result of their inspections  the fda determines that the equipment  facilities  laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable fda regulations and conditions of product approval  the fda may not approve the product or may suspend the manufacturing operations 
if the manufacturing operations of any of the suppliers for our product candidates are suspended  we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand  which would harm our business 
in addition  if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason  we might be unable to ship our approved product for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials 
significant and costly delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required 
any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates are likely to contain requirements for post marketing follow up studies  which may be costly 
product approvals  once granted  may be modified based on data from subsequent studies or commercial use 
as a result  limitations on labeling indications or marketing claims  or withdrawal from the market may be required if problems occur after commercialization 

table of contents failure to comply with regulatory requirements could prevent or delay marketing approval or require the expenditure of money or other resources to correct 
failure to comply with applicable requirements may also result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution  any of which could be harmful to our ability to generate revenues and our stock price 
we may develop  seek regulatory approval for and market our product candidates outside the united states  requiring a significant commitment of resources 
failure to successfully manage our international operations could result in significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may introduce certain of our product candidates  including heplisav  in various markets outside the united states 
developing  seeking regulatory approval for and marketing our product candidates outside the united states could impose substantial burdens on our resources and divert management s attention from domestic operations 
international operations are subject to risk  including the difficulty of managing geographically distant operations  including recruiting and retaining qualified employees  locating adequate facilities and establishing useful business support relationships in the local community  compliance with varying international regulatory requirements  laws and treaties  securing international distribution  marketing and sales capabilities  adequate protection of our intellectual property rights  obtaining regulatory and pricing approvals at a level sufficient to justify commercialization  legal uncertainties and potential timing delays associated with tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  diverse tax consequences  the fluctuation of conversion rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar  and regional and geopolitical risks 
we submitted heplisav for marketing approval in europe 
the complete response letter from the fda may result in further consideration of our maa in europe and we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
specifically  a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions 
if we are unable to successfully manage our international operations  we may incur significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates  which would impair our ability to generate revenues 
if any products we develop are not accepted by the market or if regulatory agencies limit our labeling indications or marketing claims  we may be unable to generate significant revenues  if any 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and are able to commercialize them  our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend upon a number of factors  including the indication for which the product is approved and its approved labeling  the presence of other competing approved therapies  the potential advantages of the product over existing and future treatment methods  
table of contents the relative convenience and ease of administration of the product  the strength of our sales  marketing and distribution support  the price and cost effectiveness of the product  and sufficient third party reimbursement 
the fda or other regulatory agencies could limit the labeling indication for which our product candidates may be marketed or could otherwise limit marketing efforts for our products 
if we are unable to achieve approval or successfully market any of our product candidates  or marketing efforts are restricted by regulatory limits  our ability to generate revenues could be significantly impaired 
we face uncertainty regarding coverage  pricing and reimbursement and the practices of third party payors  which may make it difficult or impossible to sell our product candidates on commercially reasonable terms 
in both domestic and foreign markets  our ability to achieve profitability will depend in part on the negotiation of a favorable price or the availability of appropriate reimbursement from third party payors  in particular for heplisav where existing products are already marketed 
existing laws affecting the pricing and coverage of pharmaceuticals and other medical products by government programs and other third party payors may change before any of our product candidates are approved for marketing 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services  and pricing and reimbursement decisions may not allow our products to compete effectively with existing or competitive products 
because we intend to offer products  if approved  that involve new technologies and new approaches to treating disease  the willingness of third party payors to reimburse for our products is uncertain 
we will have to charge a price for our products that is sufficient to enable us to recover our considerable investment in product development and our operating costs 
adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to achieve profitability and could harm our future prospects and reduce our stock price 
we are unable to predict what impact the health care and education reconciliation act of or other reform legislation will have on our business or future prospects 
the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the implementation of any proposed reforms limits our ability to forecast changes that may affect our business 
in europe  the success of our products  in particular heplisav  will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because many providers in european countries are unlikely to use medical products that are not reimbursed by their governments 
many countries in europe have adopted legislation and increased efforts to control prices of healthcare products 
we are unable to predict the impact these actions will have on our business or future prospects 
we rely on contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not fulfill their contractual obligations or meet expected deadlines  our planned clinical trials may be delayed and we may fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform their obligations or meet expected deadlines our planned clinical trials may be extended  delayed  modified or terminated 
while we conduct regular reviews of the data  we are dependent on the processes and quality control efforts of our third party contractors to ensure that detailed  quality records are maintained to support the results of the clinical trials that they are conducting on our behalf 
any extension  delay  modification or termination of our clinical trials or failure to ensure adequate documentation and the quality of the results in the clinical trials could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

table of contents a key part of our business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development of our product candidates 
we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships  which may significantly limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products successfully  if at all 
we will need to establish collaborative relationships to obtain domestic and international sales  marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates  in particular with respect to the commercialization of heplisav  if approved 
the recent fda complete response letter for heplisav may negatively impact the potential for a collaborative relationship and failure to obtain a collaborative relationship for heplisav  particularly in the european union and for other markets requiring extensive sales efforts  may significantly impair the potential for this product 
we also will need to enter into or maintain collaborative relationships to provide funding to support our other research and development programs 
the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult  time consuming and involves significant uncertainty  including our partners may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory clinical results  manufacturing issues  a change in business strategy  a change of control or other reasons  our shortage of capital resources may impact the willingness of companies to collaborate with us  our contracts for collaborative arrangements are terminable at will on written notice and may otherwise expire or terminate and we may not have alternative funding available  our partners may choose to pursue alternative technologies  including those of our competitors  we may have disputes with a partner that could lead to litigation or arbitration  we have limited control over the decisions of our partners and they may change the priority of our programs in a manner that would result in termination of the agreement or add significant delay in the partnered program  our ability to generate future payments and royalties from our partners depends upon the abilities of our partners to establish the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates  obtain regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and achieve market acceptance of products developed from our drug candidates  we or our partners may fail to properly initiate  maintain or defend our intellectual property rights  where applicable  or a party may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or potentially invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential liability  our partners may not devote sufficient capital or resources towards our product candidates  and our partners may not comply with applicable government regulatory requirements 
if any collaborator fails to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner  or at all  our research  clinical development  manufacturing or commercialization efforts pursuant to that collaboration could be delayed or terminated  or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for expenses or activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our collaborator 
if we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements  we may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of our product candidates  undertake development and commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of capital 
the financial terms of future collaborative licensing or financing arrangements could result in dilution of our share value 
funding from collaboration partners and other parties may in the future involve issuance of our equity securities 
because we do not currently have any such arrangements  we cannot be certain how the terms under 
table of contents which such shares are issued will be determined or when such determinations will be made 
the current market for financing or collaborative arrangements often involves the issuance of warrants as additional consideration in establishing the purchase price of the equity securities issued 
any such issuance could result in dilution in the value of our issued and outstanding shares 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expertise than we do 
if we are unable to successfully compete with existing or potential competitors despite these disadvantages we may be unable to generate revenues and our business will be harmed 
we compete with pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions and research organizations  in developing therapies to prevent or treat infectious and inflammatory diseases 
for example  if it is approved  heplisav will compete in the united states with established hepatitis b vaccines marketed by merck and gsk and outside the united states with vaccines from those companies and several additional established pharmaceutical companies 
competitors may develop more effective  more affordable or more convenient products or may achieve earlier patent protection or commercialization of their products 
these competitive products may render our product candidates obsolete or limit our ability to generate revenues from our product candidates 
existing and potential competitors may also compete with us for qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as for technology that would be advantageous to our business 
although certain of our employees have commercialization experience  as a company we currently have limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
our success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel  our operations may suffer and we may be unable to obtain financing  enter into collaborative arrangements  sell our product candidates or generate revenues 
as we evolve from a company primarily involved in research and development to a company potentially involved in commercialization  we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully 
as we advance heplisav through the development stage towards commercialization  we will need to expand our organization  including adding marketing and sales capabilities or contracting with third parties to provide these capabilities for us 
as our operations expand  we expect that we will also need to manage additional relationships with various collaborative partners  suppliers and other third parties 
future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on our organization  in particular on management 
in addition  we expect to enhance our senior management group as we prepare to become a commercial organization 
our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize heplisav and to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to manage any future growth effectively 
to that end  we may not be able to manage our development efforts effectively  and hire  train and integrate additional management  administrative and sales and marketing personnel  and our failure to accomplish any of these activities could prevent us from successfully growing our company 
if we fail to comply with the extensive requirements applicable to biopharmaceutical manufacturers and marketers under the healthcare fraud laws of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business  we may be subject to significant liability 
our activities  and the activities of our agents  including some contracted third parties  are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
if we obtain approval for and commercialize a vaccine or other product  our interactions with physicians and others in a position to prescribe or purchase our products will be subject to a legal regime designed to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse 
relevant us laws include the anti kickback statute  which prohibits persons from  among other things  knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering or paying remuneration  directly or indirectly  in exchange for or to 
table of contents induce either the referral of an individual for  or the purchase  order or recommendation of  any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs  such as the medicare and medicaid programs  federal false claims laws which prohibit individuals or entities from  among other things  knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment to the government or its agents that are false or fraudulent  laws that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care professionals  such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca and state laws  and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws  such as anti kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by state health insurance programs or any third party payer  including commercial insurers 
the office of inspector general for the department of health and human services  the department of justice  states attorneys general and other governmental authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations discussed above 
these entities also coordinate extensively with the fda  using legal theories that connect violations of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act such as off label promotion to the eventual submission of false claims to government healthcare programs 
prosecution of such promotion cases under the healthcare fraud laws provides the potential for private parties qui tam relators  or whistleblowers to initiate cases on behalf of the government and provides for significantly higher penalties upon conviction 
in the us  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of numerous government prosecutions and investigations alleging violations of law  including claims asserting impermissible off label promotion of pharmaceutical products  payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state health care business  submission of false claims for government reimbursement  or submission of incorrect pricing information 
violations of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations and other similar foreign laws may subject us  our employees or our agents to criminal and or civil sanctions  including fines  civil monetary penalties  exclusion from participation in government health care programs including medicare and medicaid  and the restriction or restructuring of our operations  any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
additionally  whether or not we have complied with the law  an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct may incur significant expense  cause reputational damage  divert management time and attention  and otherwise adversely affect our business 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program  we cannot guarantee that we  our employees  our consultants  contractors  or other agents are or will be in compliance with all applicable us or foreign laws 
we expect there will continue to be federal and state laws and or regulations  proposed and implemented  that could impact our operations and business 
the extent to which future legislation or regulations  if any  relating to health care fraud abuse laws and or enforcement  may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain 
the loss of key personnel  including our chief executive officer or our president  could delay or prevent achieving our objectives 
our research  product development and business efforts could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key members of our scientific or management staff  including our chief executive officer  dr 
dino dina  or our president  dr 
j 
tyler martin 
we currently have no key person insurance on any of our employees 
we intend to strengthen our senior management group as we prepare to become a commercial organization  and during the second quarter  our board of directors initiated a process for dr 
dina s succession 

table of contents we face product liability exposure  which  if not covered by insurance  could result in significant financial liability 
while we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products will subject us to potential product liability claims and may raise questions about a product s safety and efficacy 
as a result  we could experience a delay in our ability to commercialize one or more of our product candidates or reduced sales of any approved product candidates 
in addition  a product liability claim may exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we have obtained limited clinical trial liability and umbrella insurance coverage for our clinical trials 
this coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts  at an acceptable cost or at all 
we also may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product approved for marketing in the future 
a product liability claim  product recalls or other claims  as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  would divert our management s attention from our business and could result in significant financial liability 
we use hazardous materials in our business 
any claims or liabilities relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly to resolve 
our research and product development activities involve the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all government permits that are required for the storage  use and disposal of these materials 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to persons or property from these materials 
in the event of an accident related to hazardous materials  we could be held liable for damages  cleanup costs or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
risks related to our finances and capital requirements we have incurred substantial losses since inception and do not have any commercial products that generate revenue 
we have experienced significant net losses in each year since our inception 
our accumulated deficit was million as of december  to date  our revenue has resulted from collaboration agreements  government and private agency grants and services and license fees from our customers  including the customers of rhein 
we anticipate that we will incur substantial additional net losses in future years as a result of our continuing investment in research and development activities and our addition of infrastructure and operations to support regulatory approval and commercialization of heplisav 
we do not have any products that generate revenue 
there can be no assurance whether heplisav can be further developed  financed or commercialized in a timely manner without significant additional studies or patient data or significant expense  whether current development efforts will be sufficient to support approval of heplisav  or if approved  whether the market for heplisav will be sufficient for us to reach profitability 
the recent complete response letter from the fda for heplisav means that our efforts to achieve product revenues are delayed and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve approval or generate meaningful sales without significant additional resources 
our ability to generate revenue depends upon obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  generating product sales and entering into and maintaining successful collaborative relationships 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability  we may be required to reduce or discontinue our current and planned operations  enter into a transaction that constitutes a change in control of the company or raise additional capital on less than favorable terms 

table of contents if we are unable to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability  we will require substantial additional capital to continue development of our product candidates and if our most advanced candidate  heplisav  is approved  to commence sales and marketing activities 
to continue development of our product candidates and  if it is approved  to launch heplisav  we may need significant additional funds 
addressing this need may occur through strategic alliance and licensing arrangements and or future public or private financings 
we expect to continue to spend substantial funds in connection with development  manufacturing and commercialization of our product candidates  particularly heplisav  various human clinical trials for our product candidates  and protection of our intellectual property 
we currently estimate that we have sufficient resources to meet our anticipated cash needs through at least the next months based on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand as well as anticipated revenues and funding from existing agreements 
sufficient additional financing through future public or private financings  strategic alliance and licensing arrangements or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
additional equity financings  if completed  could result in significant dilution or otherwise adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available in the future  we may need to delay  reduce the scope of  or put on hold the heplisav program or other development programs while we seek strategic alternatives 
risks related to our intellectual property we rely on licenses to intellectual property from third parties 
impairment of these licenses or our inability to maintain them would severely harm our business 
our current research and development efforts depend in part upon our license arrangements for intellectual property owned by third parties 
our dependence on these licenses subjects us to numerous risks  such as disputes regarding the use of the licensed intellectual property and the creation and ownership of new discoveries under such license agreements 
in addition  these license arrangements require us to make timely payments to maintain our licenses and typically contain diligence or milestone based termination provisions 
our failure to meet any obligations pursuant to these agreements could allow our licensors to terminate our agreements or undertake other remedies such as converting exclusive to non exclusive licenses if we are unable to cure or obtain waivers for such failures or amend such agreements on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  our license agreements may be terminated or may expire by their terms  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of these licenses 
if we cannot obtain and maintain licenses that are advantageous or necessary to the development or the commercialization of our product candidates  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license similar technology or to find other alternatives to maintaining the competitive position of our products 
if such alternatives are not available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue development or commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  we must make timely payments or meet diligence obligations to maintain any such licenses in effect 
in the absence of a current license  we may be required to redesign our technology so it does not infringe a third party s patents  which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time 
if third parties successfully assert that we have infringed their patents and proprietary rights or challenge our patents and proprietary rights  we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation that would be costly  time consuming and delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights  or we may be required to enter into litigation 
table of contents to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the ownership  scope or validity of our or another party s proprietary rights  including a challenge as to the validity of our issued and pending claims 
from time to time we are involved in various interference and other administrative proceedings related to our intellectual property which has caused us to incur certain legal expenses 
if we become involved in any litigation and or other significant interference proceedings related to our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others  we will incur substantial additional expenses and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
two of our potential competitors  merck and gsk  are exclusive licensees of broad patents covering methods of production of recombinant hbsag  a component of heplisav 
in addition  the institut pasteur also owns or has exclusive licenses to patents relating to aspects of production of recombinant hbsag 
while some of these patents have expired or will soon expire outside the united states  they remain in force in the united states 
to the extent we are able to commercialize heplisav in the united states while these patents remain in force  merck  gsk or their respective licensors or the institut pasteur may bring claims against us 
if we or our collaborators are unsuccessful in defending or prosecuting our issued and pending claims or in defending potential claims against our products  for example  as may arise in the commercialization of heplisav or any similar product candidate  we or our collaborator could be required to pay substantial damages or be unable to commercialize our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies without a license from such third party 
a license may require the payment of substantial fees or royalties  require a grant of a cross license to our technology or may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any of these outcomes could require us to change our business strategy and could materially impact our business and operations 
one of our potential competitors  pfizer  has issued patent claims  as well as patent claims pending with the pto and foreign patent offices  that may be asserted against our iss products 
we may need to obtain a license to one or more of these patent claims held by pfizer by paying fees or royalties or offering rights to our own proprietary technologies to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss other than with respect to heplisav  for which we have a license 
a license for other uses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  which could preclude or limit our ability to commercialize our products 
if the combination of patents  trade secrets and contractual provisions that we rely on to protect our intellectual property is inadequate  the value of our product candidates will decrease 
our success depends on our ability to obtain and protect commercially valuable patents or the rights to patents both domestically and abroad  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from successfully challenging or infringing our proprietary rights 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use only to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we try to protect our proprietary rights by filing and prosecuting us and foreign patent applications 
however  in certain cases such protection may be limited  depending in part on existing patents held by third parties  which may only allow us to obtain relatively narrow patent protection 
in the united states  legal standards relating to the validity and scope of patent claims in the biopharmaceutical field can be highly uncertain  are still evolving and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
the biopharmaceutical patent environment outside the united states is even more uncertain 
we may be particularly affected by this uncertainty since several of our product candidates may initially address market opportunities outside the united states  where we may only be able to obtain limited patent protection 

table of contents the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following we may not receive an issued patent for any of our patent applications or for any patent applications that we have exclusively licensed  the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection or may not be valid or enforceable  we might not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us or our collaborators may not provide a competitive advantage  patents issued to other parties may limit our intellectual property protection or harm our ability to do business  other parties may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we attempt to patent  and other parties may design around technologies we have licensed  patented or developed 
we also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our trade secrets adequately 
any disclosure of confidential data in the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets 
if we are unable to adequately obtain or enforce proprietary rights we may be unable to commercialize our products  enter into collaborations  generate revenues or maintain any advantage we may have with respect to existing or potential competitors 
risks related to an investment in our common stock our stock price is subject to volatility  and your investment may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future  to be  very volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to substantial volatility depending upon many factors  many of which are beyond our control  including progress or results of any of our clinical trials or regulatory or manufacturing efforts  in particular any announcements regarding the progress or results of our planned trials and communications from the fda or other regulatory agencies  for example as evidenced by our stock decline of over following our february announcement of a complete response letter from the fda  our ability to establish and maintain collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  technological innovations  new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  changes in our intellectual property portfolio or developments or disputes concerning the proprietary rights of our products or product candidates  our ability to obtain component materials and successfully enter into manufacturing relationships for our product candidates or establish manufacturing capacity on our own  our ability to establish and maintain licensing agreements for intellectual property necessary for the development of our product candidates  changes in government regulations  general economic conditions or industry announcements  
table of contents issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  our ability to maintain continued listing on the nasdaq markets or similar exchanges  and the volume of trading in our common stock 
one or more of these factors could cause a substantial decline in the price of our common stock 
in addition  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk may be particularly relevant for us because we have experienced greater than average stock price volatility 
we may in the future be the target of such litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs  and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  delaware law and our share purchase rights plan may prevent or frustrate a change in control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control  discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
these provisions include authorizing our board of directors to issue additional preferred stock with voting rights to be determined by the board of directors  limiting the persons who can call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent  creating a classified board of directors pursuant to which our directors are elected for staggered three year terms  providing that a supermajority vote of our stockholders is required for amendment to certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
our share purchase rights plan may have certain anti takeover effects 
specifically  the rights issued pursuant to the plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the company on terms not approved by our board of directors 
although the rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the board of directors since the rights issued may be amended to permit such acquisition or redeemed by the company at per right prior to the earliest of i the time that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or ii the final expiration date of the rights  the effect of the rights plan may deter a potential acquisition of the company 
in addition  we remain subject to the provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for three years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
we will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies  which could affect our operating results 
as a public company  we will continue to incur legal  accounting and other expenses associated with reporting requirements and corporate governance requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  as well as new rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market llc 
we may 
table of contents need to continue to implement additional financial and accounting systems  procedures and controls to accommodate changes in our business and organization and to comply with new reporting requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a favorable assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to reach an unqualified assessment  or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to issue an unqualified attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting which could harm our business and could impact the price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales might occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding  all of which shares were eligible for sale in the public market  subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements under rule of the securities act of  as amended 
in addition  we have filed shelf registration statements on form s under the securities act of  as amended  to register securities that we may choose to issue in the future and on form s to register the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our stock option plans
