item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general industry trends the senior living industry generally is experiencing growth as a result of demographic factors 
according to census data  the population in the united states over age is growing much faster than the general population 
a large number of independent and assisted living communities were built in the s 
this development activity caused an excess supply of new  high priced communities 
longer than projected fill up periods resulted in low occupancy  price discounting and financial distress for many independent and assisted living operators 
development activity was significantly reduced in the early part of the last decade 
we believe that the nationwide supply and demand for these types of facilities is about balanced today 
we believe that the aging of the united states population and the significant reliance of independent and assisted living services upon revenues from residents private resources should mean that these types of facilities can be profitably operated 
the increasing availability of assisted living facilities in the s caused occupancy at many snfs to decline 
this fact  together with restrictions on development of new snfs by most states and assisted living facilities in some states  has generally caused nursing care to be delivered in older facilities 
we believe that many snfs currently in operation are becoming physically obsolete and that political pressures from an aging population will eventually cause governmental authorities to permit increased new construction 

table of contents beginning in  problems in certain domestic credit markets presaged a global credit crisis that led to a recession in the united states 
the recession resulted in aggressive government spending in the united states  significant employee layoffs  reduced availability of credit on reasonable terms in most markets  and lower real estate prices 
the weakened economic conditions created by the recession negatively affected our occupancy 
while the economy grew moderately in  it is unclear when current economic conditions  especially the housing market  may materially and sustainably improve 
although many of the services we provide are needs driven  some of those needs may be deferred during recessions  for example  relocating to a senior living community may be delayed when sales of houses are delayed 
also  we have experienced some pricing pressures from competition 
rehabilitation hospitals provide intensive medical services  including physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech language services beyond the capability customarily available in snfs 
we believe that our experience in providing high quality rehabilitation services at our irfs has assisted us in providing increasing amounts of rehabilitation services at our senior living communities 
operations we earn our senior living revenue primarily by providing housing and services to our senior living residents 
during  approximately of our senior living revenues came from the medicare and medicaid programs and approximately of our senior living revenues came from residents private resources 
we bill all private pay residents in advance for the housing and services to be provided in the following month 
our material expenses are wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our senior living communities and wage related expenses such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and other benefits 
other senior living operating expenses includes utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  marketing  insurance and community level administrative costs at our senior living communities 
rent expense we lease senior living communities including one senior living community classified as discontinued operations and two rehabilitation hospitals from snh and four senior living communities from hcp 
hospital expenses includes wages and benefits for our hospital based staff and other operating expenses related to our hospital business 
general and administrative expenses principally wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff supporting our communities and hospitals 
costs incurred on behalf of managed communities includes wages and benefits for staff and other operating expenses related to the communities that we manage for the account of snh  which are reimbursed to us by snh  including from revenues we receive from the applicable managed communities  pursuant to our management agreements with snh 
depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment that we own and we incur amortization expense on certain identifiable intangible assets 
interest and other expenses primarily includes interest on outstanding debt and amortization of deferred financing costs 
during  we added managed communities to our senior living portfolio and sold our institutional pharmacy business 
we reevaluated our segment reporting based on our focusing of our operations on our senior living portfolio  specifically independent and assisted living communities 
our 
table of contents reportable segment consists of our senior living community business 
in the senior living community segment  we operate for our own account or manage for the account of snh independent living communities  assisted living communities and snfs that are subject to centralized oversight and provide housing and services to elderly residents 
our rehabilitation hospital operating segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment as prescribed under financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standard codification topic and it is not considered a core component of our business 
therefore  we do not consider our rehabilitation hospital operating segment to be a material  separately reportable segment of our business and its operations are reported within our corporate and other activities 
this represents a change from our segment reporting in and and the presentation of these years has been revised to conform to our new segment reporting presentation 
all of our operations and assets are located in the united states  except for the operations of our captive insurance company subsidiary  which participates in our workers compensation  professional liability and automobile insurance programs and which is organized in the cayman islands 
see our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item of this annual report on form k for further financial information on our operating segments 
we use segment operating profit as a means to evaluate our performance and for our business decision making purposes 
segment operating profit for our one reportable segment excludes certain interest  dividend and other income  certain interest and other expense  benefit provision for income taxes  equity in earnings losses of aic  gain on settlement of litigation  gain on early extinguishment of debt  sales of securities  and corporate income and expenses

table of contents interest and other expense increased by for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to our assumption of four mortgage notes totaling million in connection with our acquisition of four senior living communities during during our evaluation of long lived and other intangible assets  we identified and recorded an impairment of long lived assets of million related to several senior living communities 
corporate and other our rehabilitation hospital revenues increased by for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in medicare payment rates during the first three quarters of and a slight increase in occupancy 
our rehabilitation hospital expenses increased by for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increases in labor and benefits

during the year ended december   we recognized a gain of million on sales of available for sale securities held by our captive insurance company and we incurred million of acquisition related costs  all of which relate to completed transactions 
during the year ended december   we recognized a gain of million on investments in trading securities related to our holdings of auction rate securities  or ars  a loss of million on the value of our right pursuant to an agreement with ubs ag  or ubs  to require ubs to acquire our ars at par value and a gain of  on a sale of available for sale securities held by our captive insurance company

the tax benefit also includes  related to a non cash deferred tax liability arising from the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes but not for book purposes 
as of december   our federal net operating loss carry forward  which will begin to expire in if unused  was approximately million  and our tax credit carry forward  which will begin to expire in if unused  was approximately million 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the losses in both years are primarily due to losses we incurred at assisted living communities and snfs that we have sold or expect to sell  partially offset by income from our pharmacy business that we have sold 
loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  includes an asset impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of two snfs to their estimated fair value based upon the then expected sale price less costs to sell 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and million and million available to borrow under our credit agreement and our credit facility  respectively 
we expect to use cash balances  borrowings under our credit agreement  which is scheduled to expire in march  and our credit facility  and the cash flow from our operations to fund our operations  debt repayments  investments in and maintenance of our properties  including those which are not improvements that we may sell to snh for increased rent pursuant to our leases with snh  future property acquisitions and other general business purposes 
we believe such amounts will be sufficient to fund these activities for the next months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
if  however  our occupancies decline from historic levels  the non government rates we receive for our services decline or government reimbursement rates are reduced and we are unable to generate positive cash flow for an extended period  we expect that we would explore alternatives to fund our operations 
such alternatives may include further reducing our costs  incurring debt under  and perhaps in addition to  our credit agreement and our credit facility  engaging in sale leaseback transactions of our owned communities  mortgage financing our communities that are not subject to existing mortgages and issuing new equity or debt securities 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but this registration statement does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
auction rate and available for sale securities we routinely evaluate our available for sale investments to determine if they have been impaired 
if the book or carrying value of an investment is less than its estimated fair value and we expect that situation to continue for a more than a temporary period  we will record an other than temporary impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income 
we estimate the fair value of our available for sale investments by reviewing each security current market price  the ratings of the security  the financial condition of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain the investment during temporary market price fluctuations or until maturity 
in evaluating the factors described above  we presume a decline in value to be an other than temporary impairment if the quoted market price of the security is below the security cost basis for an extended period 
however  this presumption may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating the value decline is temporary in nature  such as when the operating performance of the obligor is strong or if the market price of the security is historically volatile 
additionally  there may be instances in which impairment losses are recognized even if the 
table of contents decline in value does not fall within the criteria described above  such as if we plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below our cost basis 
when we believe that a change in fair value of an available for sale security is temporary  we record a corresponding credit or charge to other comprehensive income for any unrealized gains and losses 
when we determine that impairment in the fair value of an available for sale security is an other than temporary impairment  we record a charge to earnings 
we did not record an impairment charge for the years ended december   or until june   we held investments in trading securities which consisted of ars that were primarily bonds issued by various entities to fund student loans pursuant to the federal family education loan program 
pursuant to their terms  the ars were subject to periodic auctions  which impacted their liquidity and terms 
due to events in the credit markets  auctions for these ars failed starting in the first quarter of in november  we entered into a settlement agreement with ubs related to our investment in ars and on june   we exercised our right pursuant to this agreement to require ubs to acquire our remaining ars at par value 
ubs settled and paid to us million on july   which was net of our outstanding balance on our ubs secured revolving credit facility of million 
assets and liabilities our total current assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents results from repayment of a portion of the amount outstanding under our credit facility  repayment of the bridge loan and our purchase and retirement of a portion of the outstanding notes during  each with cash on hand  partially offset by cash received from operations and the sale of our pharmacy business 
our current and long term liabilities were million and million  respectively  at december  compared to million and million  respectively  at december  the decrease in current liabilities results from the repayment of the bridge loan  partially offset by the classification of the notes in current liabilities at december  and timing of payment and accrual differences 
the decrease in long term liabilities primarily results from the reclassification of the notes into current liabilities  partially offset by an increase in accrued self insurance obligations 
we had net cash flows from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  acquisitions of property and equipment  including the acquisition of senior living communities  on a net basis after considering the proceeds from sales of fixed assets to snh  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during and  we purchased and retired a total of million and  respectively  par value of the outstanding notes for million and  respectively  plus accrued interest 
acquisitions and related financings in may  we acquired from an unrelated third party an assisted living community containing living units located in arizona for million  excluding closing costs 
we financed the acquisition with cash on hand and by assuming a federal national mortgage association  or fnma  mortgage note for million 
we have included the results of this community operations in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we allocated the purchase price of this community to land  building and equipment 
this community primarily provides independent and assisted living services and  as of december   all of the residents pay for their services with private resources 
from june to september  we purchased the indiana communities for an aggregate purchase price  excluding closing costs  of million 
the indiana communities primarily offer 
table of contents independent and assisted living services  which are currently primarily paid by residents from their private resources and contain  living units 
we also entered into the bridge loan agreement with snh under which snh agreed to lend us up to million to help fund the purchase of the indiana communities 
in addition to the proceeds of the bridge loan  we also funded these acquisitions with a portion of the proceeds from a public offering of our common shares  or the public offering  by assuming mortgage notes secured by three of the indiana communities  by assuming net working capital liabilities of the indiana communities and with cash on hand 
during  we repaid million of the principal amount then outstanding under the bridge loan with proceeds from the public offering and cash generated by operations 
in april  we repaid in full the principal amount then outstanding under the bridge loan  resulting in termination of the bridge loan 
we funded the april repayment of the bridge loan with borrowings under our credit facility and cash on hand 
in june  we issued  of our common shares in the public offering  raising net proceeds of approximately  we used proceeds from the public offering to repay amounts outstanding under the bridge loan and to fund a portion of the cash purchase price of the indiana communities acquisition as described above 
litigation settlement on may   we entered into a settlement agreement  or the settlement agreement  with subsidiaries of sunrise senior living inc  or sunrise  pursuant to which we agreed to settle our long running litigation with sunrise  involving amounts charged by sunrise to us for certain insurance programs for senior living communities managed by sunrise for us 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  sunrise paid us million in cash and we recorded a gain of million  net of legal fees  in our consolidated statements of income 
our leases and management agreements with snh as of december   we leased senior living communities  two rehabilitation hospitals and one assisted living community which has been classified as discontinued operations from snh under four leases 
our total annual rent payable to snh as of december  was million  excluding percentage rent based on increases in gross revenues at certain properties 
we paid approximately million in percentage rent to snh for the years ended december  and upon our request  snh may purchase capital improvements made at the properties we lease from snh and increase our rent pursuant to contractual formulas  however  snh is not obligated to purchase these improvements from us and we are not obligated to sell them to snh 
during the year ended december   snh reimbursed us million for capital expenditures made at the properties leased from snh and these purchases resulted in our annual rent being increased by approximately million 
during  we entered into several management agreements and pooling agreements with snh and its affiliates  as well as entered into lease amendments with snh 
for more information regarding these activities  see note  which is incorporated herein by reference 
our revenues our revenues from services to residents at our senior living communities and patients of our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics are our primary source of cash to fund our operating expenses  including rent  capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on our debt 
during the past several years  weak economic conditions throughout the country have negatively affected many entities both within and outside of our industry 
these conditions have resulted in  among other things  a decrease in our communities occupancy  and it is unclear when these conditions  
table of contents especially in the housing market  may materially improve 
although many of the services that we provide are needs driven  some of our prospective residents may be deferring their decisions to relocate to senior living communities in light of current economic circumstances 
at our rehabilitation hospitals as well as clinics and some of our senior living communities principally our snfs  medicare and medicaid programs provide operating revenues for skilled nursing and rehabilitation services 
we derived approximately  and of our consolidated revenues from these programs  primarily at our snfs and our rehabilitation hospitals  for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
our net medicare revenues from services to senior living community residents and at our rehabilitation hospitals totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our net medicaid revenues from services to senior living community residents and at our rehabilitation hospitals totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cms adopted a final rule that took effect on october   the effect of which was to reduce aggregate medicare payment rates for snfs by approximately  or billion  in federal fiscal year cms also updated medicare payment rates for snfs effective october   which cms estimates will increase aggregate medicare payment rates for snfs by  or million  for federal fiscal year due to the prior reduction of approximately discussed above  however  medicare payment rates will be lower for federal fiscal year than they were in federal fiscal year we expect the reduction to medicare snf payment rates in federal fiscal year to be material and adverse to our future financial results of operations 
some of the states in which we operate either have not raised medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced  or are expected to freeze or reduce  medicaid rates 
in addition  certain temporary increases in federal payments to states for medicaid programs ended as of june  we expect the ending of these temporary federal payments  combined with the anticipated slow recovery of state revenues  to result in continued challenging state fiscal conditions 
some state budget deficits likely will increase  and certain states may reduce medicaid payments to healthcare services providers like us as part of an effort to balance their budgets 
we cannot currently estimate the type and magnitude of the potential medicare and medicaid policy changes  rate reductions or other changes and the impact on us of the possible failure of these programs to increase rates to match our expenses  but they may be material and adverse to our operations and may affect our future results of operations 
similarly  we are unable to predict the impact on us of the reforms to insurance  payment systems and healthcare delivery systems contained in and to be developed pursuant to the aca 
although expanded insurance availability may provide additional paying consumers for the services we provide  if the changes to be implemented under the aca result in reduced payments for our services  or the failure of medicare  medicaid or insurance payment rates to cover our costs  our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected 
medicare and medicaid programs provided approximately  and of our revenues from our rehabilitation hospitals for the years ended december   and  respectively 
effective october   cms adopted a final rule that updated medicare irf pps rates  which cms estimated would result in an aggregate net increase of in irf medicare payments for federal fiscal year the rule adjusts the aggregate rates by a rebased market basket update increase of approximately to account for inflation  reduced by an automatic and by a productivity adjustment of  both pursuant to the aca  and increased by in estimated outlier payments 
cms subsequently adopted updated medicare payment rates for irfs effective october   which cms estimates will increase aggregate medicare payment rates for irfs by  or million  for federal fiscal year the aggregate effect on our irf medicare payments for federal fiscal year may vary from cms estimate based on wage indexes and lip percentages contained in the final rule 

table of contents in addition  our two rehabilitation hospitals must satisfy the rule in order to be classified as an irf by the medicare program 
pursuant to the rule  at least of a facility inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services for one of cms designated medical conditions 
an irf that fails to meet the requirements of the rule is subject to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider  the effect of which would be to lower that irf medicare payment rates 
although we believe that our irfs are operating in compliance with the rule  the actual percentage of patients at our irfs who receive services for a designated condition may not be as high as we believe  and it may decline 
in addition  the obama administration has proposed in the past  and may propose in the future  changing the rule to a greater percentage  such that a higher percentage of a facility population would have to receive services for treatment of a designated condition 
if the percentage were increased  our irfs ability to maintain compliance with the rule would become more difficult 
our failure to remain in compliance  or a cms finding of noncompliance  if it occurs  will result in our receiving lower medicare rates than we currently receive at our irfs and could materially and adversely affect our future financial results 
insurance increases over time in the costs of insurance  especially professional liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  have had an adverse impact upon our results of operations 
although we self insure a large portion of these costs  our costs have increased as a result of the higher costs that we incur to settle claims and to purchase re insurance for claims in excess of the self insurance amounts

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessments of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  reserves related to our self insurance programs and our valuations of our goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculations 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our knowledge of current rules and regulations applicable to these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some 
table of contents medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment and sometimes retroactive legislative changes 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivables  the terms of the agreements with our residents  their third party payers or other obligors  the residents or payers stated intent to pay  the residents or payers financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or rate and payment appeal proceedings 
determining reserves for the casualty  liability  workers compensation and healthcare losses and costs that we have incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based upon our experience and our expectations of future events  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims  expected changes in premiums for insurance provided by insurers whose policies provide for retroactive adjustments  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
since these reserves are based on estimates  the actual expenses we incur may differ from the amount reserved 
we regularly adjust these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors  our actual claims experience  recommendations from our professional consultants  changes in market conditions and other factors  it is possible that such adjustments may be material 
we review goodwill annually during our fourth quarter  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances exist  for impairment 
if our review indicates that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  we reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  and our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments 
all of our goodwill is located in our senior living reporting unit 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the senior living reporting unit  as determined by discounted cash flows and market approaches such as capitalization rates and earnings multiples  with its carrying value 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis include expected future revenue growth  gross margins and our weighted average cost of capital 
the key assumption in the market approach is the selection of guideline companies and the determination of earnings multiples 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds our estimate of its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
our estimates of discounted cash flows as reflected in our baseline forecast may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions that adversely affect occupancy rates  reductions in government or third party reimbursement rates  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance affecting our gross margins 
as a result of our annual goodwill impairment review  we believe that our goodwill was not impaired as of december  as of our evaluation date  the fair value of the senior living reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by approximately 
as of december   our carrying amount of goodwill was million 
the key variables that affect the cash flows of our senior living reporting unit are estimated revenue growth rates  estimated operating expenses excluding interest and taxes  estimated capital expenditures  growth rate assumptions and the weighted average cost of our capital 
we select the revenue growth rate based on our view of the growth prospects of the senior living reporting unit considering expected occupancy rates and private pay and government and third party reimbursement rates 
estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures consider our historical and expected future operating experience 
these assumptions are subject to uncertainty  including our ability to increase a reporting unit revenue and improve its profitability 
for the senior living reporting unit  relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows or small changes in other key assumptions may result in a goodwill impairment charges 
future events that could have a negative effect on the fair value of the senior living reporting unit include  but are not limited to decreases in revenues due to decreases in the occupancy rates and our monthly rates  
table of contents decreases in revenues and profitability at our senior living communities due to the inability of residents who pay for our services with their private resources to afford our services  future medicare and medicaid rate reductions and other changes from the aca which impact our monthly rates  decreases in the reporting unit gross margins and profitability due to increased labor or other costs  or our inability to successfully stabilize an acquired community operations  increases in the weighted average cost of our capital including the market risk component  and changes in the structure of our business as a result of changes in relationships with our related parties 
changes in one or more of these factors could result in an impairment charge 
we review the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  we determine the amount of impairment loss  if any  by comparing the historical carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance  recent sales of similar assets  market conditions and projected undiscounted cash flows that our asset or asset groups are expected to generate 
this process requires that estimates be made and if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly this could have a material effect on our financial statements 
as a result of our intangibles and long lived assets impairment review  we believe that our intangibles and long lived assets were not impaired as of december  some of our judgments and estimates are based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party professionals 
any misjudgments or incorrect estimates affecting our critical accounting policy could have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to the premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
recently announced accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued an accounting standards update  health care entities topic  continuing care retirement communities refundable advance fees  or asu asu affects continuing care retirement communities  or ccrcs  that have resident contracts that provide for a payment of a refundable advance fee upon reoccupancy of that unit by a subsequent resident 
the amendments in asu clarify that an entity should classify an advance fee as deferred revenue when a ccrc has a resident contract that provides for payment of the refundable advance fee upon reoccupancy by a subsequent resident  which is limited to the proceeds of reoccupancy 
refundable advance fees that are contingent upon reoccupancy by a subsequent resident but are not limited to the proceeds of reoccupancy should be accounted for as a liability 
asu is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  and the adoption of this update is not expected to cause any material changes to the disclosures in  or the presentation of  our consolidated financial statements 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the united states has been modest 
future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  
table of contents to increase 
also  our ability to realize rate increases paid by medicare and medicaid programs may be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consists of our fixed minimum rental obligations 
accordingly  we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our senior living business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and relocations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
impact of climate change the current political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties  laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions 
we believe these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy costs at our communities to increase in the future 
in the longer term  we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our patients  residents and other customers in higher charges for our services 
however  in the short term  these increased costs  if material in amount  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there have recently been severe weather activities in different parts of the country that some observers believe evidence global climate change  including the recent hurricane sandy that impacted portions of the eastern united states in october such severe weather that may result from climate change may have an adverse affect on individual properties we own  lease or operate 
we mitigate these risks by owning  leasing and operating a diversified portfolio of properties and by procuring insurance coverage we believe adequate to protect us from material damages and losses from such activities 
however  there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that storms that may occur due to future climate change or otherwise could not have a material adverse affect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
other than as described below  we do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 

table of contents at december   our outstanding fixed rate debt consisted of the following dollars in thousands  except per share data debt principal balance annual interest rate annual interest expense maturity interest payments due convertible senior notes  semi annually mortgages   monthly mortgages  monthly mortgages  monthly mortgages  monthly mortgages  monthly mortgages  monthly the principal balances  annual interest rates and annual interest expense are the amounts stated in the applicable contracts 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  our carrying values and recorded interest expense may differ from these amounts because of market conditions at the time we assumed certain of these debts 
the notes  are convertible  if certain conditions are met including certain changes in our control  into our common shares at any time 
the initial conversion rate  which is subject to adjustment  is common shares per principal amount of the notes  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
we may prepay the notes at any time and holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on each of october   and  or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events prior to october  our mortgages require principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to amortization schedules 
because these debts bear interest at a fixed rate  changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our interest obligations 
if these debts were refinanced at interest rates which are basis points higher or lower than shown above our per annum interest costs would increase or decrease by approximately changes in market interest rates would affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analyses through the respective maturity dates  and assuming no other changes in factors that may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations  a hypothetical immediate basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of those obligations by approximately million and million  respectively 
changes in the trading price of our common shares may also affect the fair value of the notes 
our mortgages generally contain provisions that allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
in some cases  we are not allowed to make early repayment prior to a cutoff date and we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at a premium equal to a make whole amount  as defined  which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder 
also  we have in the past repurchased and retired some of our outstanding debts and we may do so again in the future 
these prepayment rights and our ability to repurchase and retire outstanding debt may afford us opportunities to mitigate the risk of refinancing our debts at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity 

table of contents at december   our floating rate debt consisted of outstanding under our credit facility and our credit agreement 
our credit facility matures in april and our credit agreement matures in march no principal repayments are required under our credit facility or our credit agreement prior to maturity  and prepayments may be made  and redrawn  subject to conditions  at any time without penalty 
borrowings under our credit facility and our credit agreement are in us dollars and typically bear interest at libor plus a spread 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term interest rates  specifically libor 
there have been recent government inquiries regarding the setting of libor  which may result in changes to the process that could have the effect of increasing libor 
in addition  upon renewal or refinancing of our credit facility or our credit agreement  we are vulnerable to increases in interest rate spreads due to market conditions or our perceived credit risk 
generally  a change in interest rates would not affect the value of debt outstanding under our credit facility and our credit agreement but would affect our operating results 
the following table presents the impact a basis point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense as of december  if we were fully drawn on our credit facility and our credit agreement dollars in thousands impact of increase in interest rates weighted average interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year earnings per common share effect at december  basis point increase the foregoing tables show the impact of an immediate increase in the interest rates on our credit facility and credit agreement 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our credit facility or our credit agreement 
although we have no present plans to do so  we may in the future enter into hedge arrangements from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates
