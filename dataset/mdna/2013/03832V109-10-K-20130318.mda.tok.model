general we are a nevada corporation and have been in existence since on september   the company changed its name from nexmed  inc to apricus biosciences  inc we have operated in the pharmaceutical industry since  initially focusing on research and development in the area of drug delivery and are now primarily focused on product development in the area of sexual health 
our proprietary drug delivery technology is called nexact and we have one approved drug using the nexact delivery system  vitaros  which is approved in canada for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  which we expect will be launched in the first half of by our partner abbott 
also in the area of sexual health is our femprox product candidate for female sexual arousal disorder 
additionally the company has mycova for onychomycosis excluding tinea pedis nail fungal infection  and rayva for raynaud s syndrome as product candidates using the nexact permeation enhancer 
we continue to enter into and are seeking additional commercialization partnerships for our existing pipeline of products and product candidates  including vitaros  and femprox and we are enhancing our business development efforts by offering potential partners clearly defined regulatory paths for our products under development 
our lead product  vitaros  was approved for commercialization in canada in november  and is now partnered in the united states  canada  germany  the united kingdom  italy  certain countries in the middle east  the gulf countries and israel 
our near term focus for vitaros is to commence sales in canada in the first half of through our commercial partner  abbott  and to continue to generate revenue from partnerships for the product with other commercial partners 
we also expect payment from certain of our partners on the approval of vitaros in europe and other territories 
typically  in our partnership arrangements we receive up front payments in exchange for license rights to our products plus sales milestones and royalties to be paid upon commercialization of the product 
we filed for marketing approval for vitaros in europe in the second quarter of and we expect to receive an approval decision in europe in the first half of the company operated in three segments during pharmaceuticals designs and develops pharmaceutical products including those with its nexact platform  
table of contents diagnostic sales sells diagnostic products and  prior to june   provided pre clinical cro services through the company s former subsidiary  bio quant  and contract sales provides contract sales for third party pharmaceutical companies through the company s subsidiary  finesco 
as previously announced  we made the strategic decision in december to focus on our core product candidates associated with sexual health and the underlying nexact technology 
as a result  we chose to divest our united states based oncology supportive care business which was aggregated into our pharmaceuticals segment and is presented as a discontinued operation at december  additionally  we announced in march that we ceased funding finesco  which could result in the dissolution of these entities  in which case we will receive little or no return on our investment 
these subsidiaries are presented in the contract sales segment during liquidity  capital resources and financial condition 
we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception 
through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and our operations have principally been financed through public offerings of our common stock and other equity instruments  private placements of equity securities  debt financing and up front license fees received from commercial partners 
funds raised in from common stock transactions include approximately million in net proceeds from our february follow on public offering  approximately million from the sale of common stock through our at the market stock sales facility and approximately million from the exercise of warrants outstanding 
the receipt of this cash during was offset by our cash used in operations 
our net cash outflow from operations during the year was approximately million  which resulted from the increase in expenditures for research and development activities while we commercialize our vitaros product for sale in canada and obtain market approval in other regions 
in november  we extended the term of our million convertible notes payable with private investors and the notes are now due in december these recent transactions should not be considered an indication of our ability to raise additional funds in any future periods 
we operate in a rapidly changing and highly regulated marketplace and we expect to adjust our capital needs and financing plans as our operational objectives and market conditions dictate 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  were approximately million 
we expect to require external financing to fund our long term operations 
in march of we closed the sale of our new jersey facility resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
as a result  we believe we have sufficient cash reserves to fund our on going operations for the next twelve months  however  we expect to continue to have net cash outflows from operations in as we execute our market approval and commercialization plan for vitaros  develop and implement a regulatory and clinical trial program for femprox for fsad and further develop our pipeline products 
we announced in march that we would cease funding finesco 
we expect our cash inflows during will be from licensing and milestone revenues received from commercial partners for our late stage product candidates and from royalty payments received from sales in canada 
we expect our most significant expenditures in will include development expenditures including continued regulatory and manufacturing activities related to vitaros and costs associated with the clinical development of femprox 
based on our recurring losses  negative cash flows from operations and working capital levels  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to finance our operations 
if we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources  including by raising additional funds when needed  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the needed financing on reasonable terms or at all 
additionally  equity financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing stockholders and may result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock 

table of contents we have two effective shelf registration statements on form s filed with the sec under which we may offer from time to time any combination of debt securities  common and preferred stock and warrants 
one of the registration statements relates to our at the market common stock selling facility through ascendiant capital 
this facility allows us ready access to cash through the sale of newly issued shares of our common stock 
as of march   we have available million under this at the market common stock selling facility 
the company s at the market common stock selling facility may be terminated by either party by giving proper written notice 
the rules and regulations of the sec or any other regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to conduct certain types of financing activities  or may affect the timing of and amounts we can raise by undertaking such activities 
even if we are successful in obtaining additional cash resources to support further development of our products  we may still encounter additional obstacles such as our development activities may not be successful  our products may not prove to be safe and effective  clinical development work may not be completed in a timely manner or at all  and the anticipated products may not be commercially viable or successfully marketed 
additionally  our business could require additional financing if we choose to accelerate product development expenditures in advance of receiving up front payments from development and commercial partners 
if our efforts to raise additional equity or debt funds when needed are unsuccessful  we may be required to delay or scale back our development plans  reduce costs and personnel and cease to operate as a going concern 
these financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
critical accounting estimates and policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our judgements based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time to calculate our best estimates  different estimates reasonably could have been used 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from time to time  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include the recognition of revenue  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impact operating expenses when we impair assets or accelerate depreciation  the assessment of contingent consideration  discontinued operations  stock based compensation which impacts operating expenses  and income taxes  which primarily impacts our net loss 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions used in our accounting practices periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  our actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we have historically generated revenues from licensing of technology rights  product sales  performance of pre clinical testing services  and contract sales services 
payments received under commercial arrangements such as the licensing of technology rights  may include non refundable fees at the inception of the arrangements  milestone payments for specific achievements designated in the agreements  royalties on sales of products  and payments for the sale of rights to future royalties 

table of contents license arrangements 
license arrangements may consist of non refundable upfront license fees  regulatory and sales milestones  royalties upon sales of product  and the delivery of product and or research services to the licensee 
these arrangements are often multiple element arrangements 
critical estimate revenue from our license arrangements is determined by assessing the deliverables in the arrangement under the authoritative guidance for multiple element arrangements 
analyzing the arrangement to identify deliverables requires the use of judgment 
deliverables may include a right or license to use an asset  a performance obligation  or an obligation to deliver product and or research services 
once we identify the deliverables under the arrangement  we determined whether or not the deliverables can be accounted for as separate units of accounting  and the appropriate method of revenue recognition for each element 
revenue is recognized upon delivery of the elements within the arrangement based upon the consideration allocated to each deliverable 
the value of the license and associated upfront payments is based upon similar arrangements 
long lived and intangible assets we review for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
if such assets are considered impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  fair value being determined based upon discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
we recorded impairment charges related to our long lived and intangible assets for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
critical estimate we evaluated our building in east windsor  new jersey and management committed to a plan to sell the land  building and related equipment 
these assets are categorized as assets held for sale on the balance sheet at december  and totaled million 
equipment held for sale is no longer subject to depreciation  and is recorded at the lower of depreciated carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell 
we incurred an impairment charge of million based upon the expected net selling price less the associated environmental remediation costs related to our building in east windsor  new jersey 
in addition to the impairment on the assets held for sale  the building was leased to a non related party with escalating rent over a ten year period 
we record this rental income on a straight line basis with the difference between rental income and payments received recorded as a deferred rental income asset 
as a result of the sale we will not amortize the deferred rental income over the term of the lease and accordingly an impairment in the amount of million was recorded in these impairment charges were recorded in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in general and administrative expenses 
we completed the sale of these assets in march critical estimate in december  the company made the strategic decision to divest the oncology supportive care business and is currently seeking buyers for the business or the individual assets therein 
the decision to sell the business was a triggering event that required us to evaluate our assets held for sale including our intangible assets for impairment by comparing the book values of the company s co promotion rights  technology licenses and trade names against their respective estimated fair value 
we evaluated our oncology supportive care business with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  the estimated fair values of the company s co promotion rights  technology licenses and trade names were determined using a discounted cash flows model and a market approach based on multiple offers the company received for certain assets of the business 
the discounted cash flows model requires certain assumptions and judgments including but not limited to estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for the businesses  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the company s weighted average cost of capital 
we determined that estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets used in that business and their eventual disposition are less than their carrying amount 
we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down our intangible assets to million 
this impairment charge has been recorded in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
we expect to sell these assets by the end of the second quarter of the economic terms of the sale are 
table of contents expected to include an up front payment and potential earn out consideration based on the future performance by the buyer 
depending on the value of the up front payment  we may record additional gains or losses associated with the intangible assets currently being held for sale 
any earn out consideration will be recorded as a recovery of the loss or additional gains when any contingency has lapsed 
on december   we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the fair value of know how related to bio quant to million 
the impairment charge was recorded in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill we review for impairment annually and between annual tests if we become aware of an event or a change in circumstances that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
we perform our annual impairment testing as of december of each year 
the first step of the impairment test requires that the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit  and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform step of the goodwill impairment assessment 
step of the assessment involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
we recorded impairment charges related to our goodwill for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
million of the impairment charge in is recorded as impairment on goodwill and intangible assets and million is recorded in discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
critical estimate application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for the businesses  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the company s weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we made the strategic decision in march  to no longer provide funding to finesco primarily as a result of changes in reimbursement policies which now heavily favor generic drugs  which has resulted in a decrease in sales for pharmaceutical company s and contract sales organizations 
specifically  in the last quarter in  scomedica experienced a loss or interruption in certain key contract agreements related to this policy change 
these combined developments have resulted in a meaningful decrease in the subsidiary s value potential 
the company has re assessed the fair value of the reporting unit as of december  as a result of the projected decrease in revenues the business is expected to incur substantial losses over the foreseeable future and the company recorded a charge in the amount of million and recognized a full impairment of the goodwill associated with the finesco transaction 
as part of the company s annual impairment test at december  and as a result of the decision in december to sell the business  we determined the goodwill related to the acquisition of topotarget was fully impaired and a charge of million was recorded to write off the carrying value of the goodwill 
the company analyzed the fair value using discounted cash flow models and comparing the results to offers made on the assets of the business 
the fair value was significantly less than the carrying value and the asset failed step the company then compared the fair value estimated in step to the fair value of the net assets less goodwill to calculate the implied value of goodwill 
the fair value of the net assets less goodwill was approximately the same as the fair value of the business 
thus the implied goodwill was determined to be and the goodwill associated with the oncology supportive care business was fully impaired 
similarly  at december   we determined that the value of goodwill related to the acquisition of bio quant was impaired and a charge of million was recorded to write off the entire value of goodwill 

table of contents contingent consideration in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we record the fair value of future contingent payments related to our topotarget acquisition as a liability based on the timing and probability of success of regulatory approvals and commercial milestones being met 
on a quarterly basis  we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to discontinued operations 
changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates and changes in our estimates of the likelihood of or timing of achieving any regulatory or commercial milestones 
critical estimate application of the present value calculation requires significant judgment to establish probability and timing of the event as well as the risk associated with each event 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the value of the acquired company as of the purchase date 
the purchase consideration for topotarget contains six future milestones and two possible adjustment payments 
each of the remaining contingencies at december  has been evaluated for the probability of achieving the milestone and the timing of the milestone 
the re evaluation resulted in a reduction of this liability due to the expected delay in the timing of meeting the expected milestones 
the result is a reduction in interest expense in the amount of million and is recorded as a gain in discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
interest rates associated with the various risks have been used along with the estimated event date to calculate the present value of the consideration 
the contingent commercial milestones that support the recorded liabilities are based on future events 
it cannot be assured that the obligations will be liquidated with the possible sale of the business and the ultimate outcome will be dependent on the terms of any future sale and on the future events which may result 
income taxes we recognize deferred taxes by the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
at december   we recorded a valuation allowance of million to fully reserve our deferred tax asset in france 
this amount was recorded in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in tax expense 
critical estimate in consideration of our accumulated losses and lack of historical ability to generate taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets  we have determined it is not more likely than not we will be able to realize any benefit from our temporary differences and have recorded a full valuation allowance 
if we become profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net operating loss carry forward  we would immediately record the estimated net realized value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would be approximately under current tax laws 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
stock based compensation in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must calculate the value of stock options and restricted stock issued to employees  non employee contractors and warrants issued to investors 
the fair value of each option and warrant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model is a generally accepted method of estimating the value of stock options and warrants 
critical estimate the black scholes option pricing model requires us to estimate the company s dividend yield rate  expected volatility and risk free interest rate over the life of the option 
inaccurately estimating any one of these factors may cause the value of the option to be under or over estimated 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the current estimates used in the black scholes pricing model

total revenue the million increase in total revenue during  when compared to  is primarily due to higher license fee revenue which accounted for million of the increase  service revenue from warner chilcott in the amount of million and new revenue from contract sales services related to our french subsidiaries which have been included in our statements of operations beginning july  which accounted for million of the increase 
the increase in license fee revenue was primarily attributable to recognizing upfront fees during from sandoz  abbott and takeda for million  million and million  respectively  compared to million that was recognized in aggregate during from bracco  elis and neopharm 
these increases were partially offset by million in lower contract service revenue resulting from the sale of our subsidiary  bio quant  in june and million in lower grant revenue resulting from government grants awarded to us during under the qtdp program 
we did not apply for any grants during the remaining difference was due other insignificant sources of revenue 
in march we decided to cease funding our french subsidiaries and do not expect to have significant revenues from contract services in the future 
we expect any near term revenues to be mainly derived from license fees and royalties from sales of our approved products by license partners 
the timing of these revenues are uncertain  as such our revenue will vary significantly between periods 
the million decrease in total revenue during  when compared to  is primarily due to the sale of our subsidiary  bio quant  in june which accounted for the million decrease in contract service revenue

these increases were partially offset by reductions in patent expenses of million  license fees of million and other general and administrative expenses decreased million 
in march we ceased funding our french subsidiaries 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a result of eliminating the costs associates with the french subsidiaries 
general and administrative expenses during  when compared to  increased million due primarily to increased compensation expenses associated with additional personnel to support the growing organization 
we also incurred higher expenses related to third party services for investor relations activities 
these increases were partially offset by the sale of our subsidiary  bio quant  in june  which accounted for a million decrease in expense 
effects of inflation we believe the impact of inflation and changing prices on net revenues and on operations has been minimal during the past three years 
loss recovery on sale of bio quant subsidiary during  we received million in payments from the buyer of our former subsidiary  bio quant  and recognized a recovery on the sale of that subsidiary 
during  upon the sale of our subsidiary  bio quant  we recognized a loss of million in the second quarter of due to the uncertainty associated with the contingent consideration  future minimum payments were not recognized in accounts receivable as of the sale date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we typically invest all  or substantially all  of our cash in money market funds that invest primarily in government securities 
our investment policy also permits investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december  and  we did not have any holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  or any foreign currency denominated transactions  and all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market mutual funds and other investments that we believe to be highly liquid 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december  and  this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date nor our net loss for the years then ended 
due to the short holding period of our investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure
