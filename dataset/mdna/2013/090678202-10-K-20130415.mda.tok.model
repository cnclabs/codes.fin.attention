gel capsule related developments the capsule incident and effects on the company s financial position in april  prc state food and drug administration sfda launched an investigation of several capsule manufacturers based in zhejiang  hebei and jiangxi provinces into their use of industrial gelatin  which contained impermissibly high chromium content 
on may   following a nationwide inspection  sfda authorities reported that batches of gel capsules from drug manufacturers in provinces were found to have high chromium levels 
the results of this inspection were publicly distributed in china  including publication on sfda s website http www 
sda 
gov 
cn ws cl as a result  sfda effectively suspended sales of gel capsules nationwide until the investigation was completed 
in may  following an onsite inspection by the xianyang state food and drug administration sfda  samples from a batch of our xin aoxing capsules were found to contain chromium content higher than edible gelatin 
specifically  samples from a batch of cases of the xin aoxing capsules each of the cases contains  capsules  representing biostar sales of approximately rmb  or approximately  were also found to contain high levels of chromium  which capsules  in the company s estimation  were sold in the market in mid the company did not check the batch in question for the chromium levels at that time since prc pharmaceutical companies were not required to test their gel capsule inventories and purchases for chromium levels in as required by sfda in april  the company purchased gel capsule inspection equipment to measure the chromium levels in gel capsules it used 
the company also undertook a thorough inspection of all samples of drugs sold and its current product inventory to ensure that all of the gel capsules it had purchased and currently uses comply with the sfda chromium content requirements 
in addition  the company conducted checks of every batch of raw materials it uses in every production category and  except as discussed above  found no violations of the chromium content requirements 
further  the company recalled all such affected capsules as promptly and thoroughly as possible  and imposed heightened quality control and assurance measures going forward 
on july   the sfda approved the company s resumption of sales of its gel capsules following a thorough inspection of raw materials used in every production category  all samples of drugs sold and the current product inventory 
however  the suspension of sales of gel capsule products severely affected all china based pharmaceutical companies that use gelatin capsules to manufacture their drugs 
the company was not immune to the industry wide losses and  as discussed below  the company s sales and overall results for the were similarly adversely affected 
as a result of the sales suspension of our capsule products  which accounted for of our total sales in the year ended  from april through july of  and the negative publicity generated by the incident  we have experienced a decrease of or million of our total capsules sales 
net sales of our capsule was million during the year ended  as compared to approximately million 
management has estimated that gross profit lost as a result of the incident amounts to approximately million  after eliminating the effect of changes in sale price and cost of goods sold 
in addition  the company paid an administrative penalty to the sfda of approximately million and compensations to our customers totaling approximately million 
we also experienced a delay in the settlement of our account receivables as our customers were unable to resell our capsule products to consumers 
average accounts receivables turnover increased to days for the years ended december  from days for the year ended december  accordingly  we recognized an impairment to our account receivables totaling million 
total measurable financial impact to the company was estimated at a minimum of approximately million 
the company has been taking a number of steps to restart sales of gel capsule drugs immediately following the sfda approval  including  among others  engaging its employees to work overtime  adding a second shift  launching an aggressive advertising campaign to help improve consumer confidence  establishing incentives for the sales force in all of the distribution offices nationwide  and launching an innovating bc call center to take order and provide hands on sales support

other general and administrative expenses increased slightly as we expanded more resources in dealing with the sfda concerning our product safety

as a result of the suspension of our capsule sales from may to august  our customers were unable to resell our products to consumers 
consequently  our customers delayed in settling our account receivables 
average account receivables turnover increased to days for the year ended december   from days for the year ended december  in light of this delay  management decided to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts to approximately million in as at december  from approximately million as at december  in connection with the capsule incident that led to the suspension of our capsule sales  we were imposed a onetime  non appealable administrative penalty of approximately million by the sfda

table of contents provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we had an income tax recovery of approximately million  which is due to our operating loss during the year 
for the year ended december   our provision for income taxes was approximately million 
the effective tax rates  taking into consideration differences in allowable deductions  and changes in valuation allowances  were nil and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
the uniform corporate income tax rate is in china 
the calculation of effective tax rate include the operating results of all our subsidiaries  including the us corporate company 
as a result of our net operating loss during the year ended december   which may be used to offset future net operating income  we have recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and net working capital of approximately million 
we expect to generate sufficient cash and cash equivalents from the realization of our accounts receivables 
we suffered a delay in the receipt of our accounts receivables as a result of the capsule incident  however  the situation has improved recently as we expanded more resources on collection of accounts receivables 
for the interim period ended march   cash generated from realization of accounts receivables was approximately million 
we anticipate that more of our accounts receivables totaling approximately million  as at december   will be received in the second quarter of we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and net working capital as at december   as well as net cash inflows during the first and second quarters in will be sufficient to maintain our operations at present level for at least the next twelve months 
as at december   cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated in rmb and were deposited with banks in the prc 
these cash and cash equivalents may not be freely convertible into foreign currencies and the remittance of these funds out of the prc may be subjected to exchange control restrictions imposed by the prc government 
on an on going basis  we take steps to identify and plan our needs for liquidity and capital resources  to fund our operations and day to day business operations 
our future capital expenditures will include  among others  expanding product lines  research and development capabilities  and making acquisitions as deemed appropriate 
based on our current plans for the next months  we anticipate that the sales of the company s pharmaceutical products will be the primary organic source of funds for future operating activities in however  to fund continued expansion of our operation and extend our reach to broader markets  and to acquire additional entities  as we may deem appropriate  we may rely on bank borrowing  if available  as well as capital raises 
there is no assurance that we will find such funding on acceptable terms  if at all 
currently  substantially all of our buildings  building improvements and land use rights are pledged against short term bank loans with various due dates from october to december  which may restrict our abilities to obtain further bank financing until these short term loans are repaid 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million 
this was primarily due to our net loss of approximately million  adjusted by non cash related expenses including depreciation and amortization of approximately million  stock based compensation of approximately million  provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million  and research and development expenses of approximately million  offset by a non cash increase in deferred tax assets of approximately million and a net increase in working capital items of approximately million 
the net increase in working capital items was mainly due to decrease in accounts receivable resulting from decrease in sales and increase in accounts and other payables  offset by increase in prepaid expenses and tax receivables 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  primarily consisting of approximately million paid as a deposit to acquire additional drugs approvals from former equity holders of shaanxi weinan and a loan to a third party of approximately million 
the loan of million made to a third party was for the purpose of better utilization of cash and to increase interest income 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  consisting of proceeds from the three short term bank loans obtained from a local bank in the prc and an advance from a related party  offset by repayment of short term bank loans obtained in critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of customer accounts and management s best estimate of the likelihood of potential loss  taking into account such factors as the financial condition and payment history of major customers 
management evaluates the collectability of the receivables at least quarterly 
if the financial condition of a customer was to deteriorate further  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
such differences could be material and could significantly impact cash flows from operating activities 
the following are steps the company takes in collecting accounts receivable step after the payment term has been exceeded  the company stops taking orders from the delinquent customer and allows the responsible sales person three to six months to collect the accounts receivable 
most of the accounts receivable will be collected in this step because the sales person s compensation is tied to sales receipts 
the company s normal sales term is days credit period 
step if the sales person s collection efforts are not successful  the company hires a collection agent and allows the agent another three to six months to collect the accounts receivable 
step if the collection agent s efforts are not successful  the company will commence legal action to collect the accounts receivable 
our policies for writing off the accounts receivable are as follows if after taking legal action  it appears that an accounts receivable is not likely to become collectible  such accounts receivable will be written off if it is more than two years old 
if during the collection period  the customer provides bankruptcy or other insolvency documentation  the corresponding accounts receivable will be written off 
if we are no longer able to locate a particular customer in order for us to take any collection or legal actions  the accounts receivable for such customer will be written off if it is more than two years old 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  future pricing and market conditions 
if actual future demands  future pricing or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required and the differences could be material 
such differences might significantly impact cash flows from operating activities 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
judgment is required to determine the estimated useful lives of assets  especially for computer equipment  including determining how long existing equipment can function and when new technologies will be introduced at cost effective price points to replace existing equipment 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life 
changes in these assumptions could materially impact the financial position and results of operations 

table of contents valuation of intangibles from time to time  we acquire intangible assets that are beneficial to our product development processes 
management periodically evaluates the carrying value of intangibles  including the related amortization periods 
in evaluating acquired intangible assets  management determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the operation and eventual disposition of the product line with its carrying value 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the carrying value of each intangible asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on either a discounted cash flows analysis or market analysis 
future operating income is based on various assumptions  including regulatory approvals  patents being granted  and the type and nature of competing products 
if regulatory approvals or patents are not obtained or are substantially delayed  or other competing technologies are developed and obtain general market acceptance or market conditions otherwise change  our intangibles may have a substantially reduced value  which could be material 
research and development the remuneration of the company s research and development staff  materials used in internal research and development activities  and payments made to third parties in connection with collaborative research and development arrangements  are all expensed as incurred 
where the company makes a payment to a third party to acquire the right to use a product formula which has received regulatory approval  that payment is accounted for as the acquisition of a license or patent and is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over the shorter of the remaining license period or patent life see above intangible assets 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
management s judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  management s interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or management s interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the financial statements 
management s assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render management s current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from the estimates  thus materially impact the financial position and results of operations 
foreign currency our functional currency is the us dollar  and our subsidiary and our vie in china use their respective local currencies as their functional currencies  ie the rmb 
an entity s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
management must use judgment in determining an entity s functional currency  assessing economic factors including cash flow  sales price  sales market  expense  financing and inter company transactions and arrangements 
the impact from exchange rate changes related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency is recorded as a gain and loss in the statements of operations  while the impact from exchange rate changes related to translating a foreign entity s financial statements from the functional currency to its reporting currency  the us dollar  is disclosed and accumulated in a separate component under the equity section of the balance sheets 
different judgments or assumptions resulting in a change of functional currency may materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
business combinations business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with asc  business combinations 
under the acquisition method the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes percent of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  regardless of the percentage owned  at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
to the extent the fair value of net assets acquired  including other identifiable assets  exceed the purchase price  a bargain purchase gain is recognized 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed from contingencies must also be recognized at fair value  if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period 
results of operations of an acquired business are included in the statement of earnings from the date of acquisition 
acquisition related costs  including conversion and restructuring charges  are expensed as incurred 
we adopted this guidance as of january  and applied it to the meipude and shaanxi weinan acquisitions 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total within year years years years short term bank loan due to related party research and development contracts total contractual obligations inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in regulation s k section a

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a smaller reporting company as defined by regulations s k and as such  are not required to provide this information
