management overview the company s net income totaled  or per diluted share  which was a record level of earnings for the company and represented an increase on a per share basis over the company s net income of  or per diluted share 
the company s return on average equity for was  representing the eighth consecutive year the company has achieved a double digit return on equity 
the record earnings performance during was attributable to both an increased level of net interest income  driven by a higher level of earnings assets within both the company s loan portfolio and securities portfolio  and a reduced level of provision for loan loss  as the company s asset quality remained strong while showing continued improvement 
net interest income improved by  or approximately  during compared with provision for loan loss declined  or  during compared with the company s earnings were positively impacted by a  or  increase in the level of non interest income 
the key drivers in the increased level of non interest income was higher trust and investment product fees  increased levels of gains related to the liquidation of other real estate  and higher levels of gains on sales of residential mortgage loans 
non interest expenses remained relatively stable during compared with  increasing by  or less than 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial condition and results of operations for german american bancorp  inc presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection of and application of these policies involve estimates  judgments  and uncertainties that are subject to change 
the critical accounting policies and estimates that the company has determined to be the most susceptible to change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of securities available for sale  and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance 
evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans  and consideration of past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of two components of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are subject to a standardized grading process administered by an internal loan review function 
the need for specific reserves is considered for credits when graded substandard or when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired 
specific allocations on impaired loans are determined by comparing the loan balance to the present value of expected cash flows or expected collateral proceeds 
allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical averages  including those graded substandard and non performing consumer or residential real estate loans 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans  homogeneous portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a one year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  judgmentally adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 
due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes a minor unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as economic uncertainties  lending staff quality  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  and broad portfolio quality trends 
therefore  the ratio of allocated to unallocated components within the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
securities valuation securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the company obtains market values from a third party on a monthly basis in order to adjust the securities to fair value 
equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are carried at cost 
additionally  when securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  a charge will be recorded through earnings  therefore  future changes in the fair value of securities could have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
in determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary  management considers the reason for the decline  the extent of the decline  the duration of the decline and whether the company intends to sell or believes it will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery 
as of december   gross unrealized losses on the securities available for sale portfolio totaled approximately  and gross unrealized gains totaled approximately  as of december   held to maturity securities had a gross unrecognized gain of approximately  income tax expense income tax expense involves estimates related to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers the likelihood that sufficient taxable income of appropriate character will be generated within carryback and carryforward periods  including consideration of available tax planning strategies 
tax related loss contingencies  including assessments arising from tax examinations and tax strategies  are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in considering the likelihood of loss  management considers the nature of the contingency  the progress of any examination or related protest or appeal  the views of legal counsel and other advisors  experience of the company or other enterprises in similar matters  if any  and management s intended response to any assessment 
results of operations net income net income for the year ended december  totaled  or per diluted share  an increase of  or approximately on a per share basis  from the year ended december  net income of  or per diluted share

net interest income net interest income is the company s single largest source of earnings  and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin  including the volume and mix of earning assets  interest rates  and income taxes 
many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions 
factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit and deposit demand  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws

risk management the company is exposed to various types of business risk on an on going basis 
these risks include credit risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
various procedures are employed at the company s subsidiary bank to monitor and mitigate risk in the loan and investment portfolios  as well as risks associated with changes in interest rates 
following is a discussion of the company s philosophies and procedures to address these risks 
lending and loan administration primary responsibility and accountability for day to day lending activities rests with the company s subsidiary bank 
loan personnel at the subsidiary bank have the authority to extend credit under guidelines approved by the bank s board of directors 
the executive loan committee serves as a vehicle for communication and for the pooling of knowledge  judgment and experience of its members 
the committee provides valuable input to lending personnel  acts as an approval body  and monitors the overall quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
the corporate credit risk management committee comprised of members of the company s and its subsidiary bank s executive officers and board of directors  strives to ensure a consistent application of the company s lending policies 
the company also maintains a comprehensive risk grading and loan review program  which includes quarterly reviews of problem loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
the purpose of this program is to evaluate loan administration  credit quality  loan documentation and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable  incurred credit losses identified during its loan review process 
management estimates the required level of allowance for loan losses using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a specific reserves on individual credits  b general reserves for certain loan categories and industries  and overall historical loss experience  and c unallocated reserves based on performance trends in the loan portfolios  current economic conditions  and other factors that influence the level of estimated probable losses 
the need for specific reserves are considered for credits when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring

non performing assets non performing assets consist of a non accrual loans  b loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  c loans past due days or more as to principal or interest  and  d other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more or when the borrower s ability to repay becomes doubtful 
uncollected accrued interest is reversed against income at the time a loan is placed on non accrual 
loans are typically charged off at days past due  or earlier if deemed uncollectible 
exceptions to the non accrual and charge off policies are made when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection

the company purchases individual loans and groups of loans 
purchased loans that show evidence of credit deterioration since origination are recorded at the amount paid or allocated fair value in a purchase business combination  such that there is no carryover of the seller s allowance for loan losses 
after acquisition  incurred losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
purchased loans that indicated evidence of credit deterioration since origination at the time of acquisition by the company did not have a material adverse impact on the company s key credit metrics during or the key credit metrics the company measures generally include non performing loans  past due loans  and adversely classified loans

if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate loans  and agricultural loans are evaluated individually for impairment 
smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total 
such loans include real estate loans secured by one to four family residences and loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures

interest income recognized on non accrual loans for was  the gross interest income that would have been recognized in on non performing loans if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was  loans are typically placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
liquidity and interest rate risk management liquidity is a measure of the ability of the company s subsidiary bank to fund new loan demand  existing loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
the purpose of liquidity management is to match sources of funds with anticipated customer borrowings and withdrawals and other obligations to ensure a dependable funding base  without unduly penalizing earnings 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements can result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations on less than desirable terms 
the liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiary  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations explained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  as enhanced by its ability to draw upon term financing arrangements and a line of credit established by the parent company with a correspondent bank lender as described under sources of funds parent company funding sources  above 
the subsidiary bank s source of funding is predominately core deposits  time deposits in excess of  and brokered certificates of deposit  maturities of securities  repayments of loan principal and interest  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
the company s asset liability committee monitors compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than stand by letters of credit as disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee and board of directors 
primary market risks  which impact the company s operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following table provides an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to decrease under either an increase or decrease of in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands

actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied therein as a result of certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties expressed above  those that are described in management s discussion and analysis in item of this report  and those that are described in item of this report  business  under the caption forward looking statements and associated risks  which discussions are incorporated herein by reference
