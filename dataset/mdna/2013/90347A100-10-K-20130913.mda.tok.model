table of contents by reducing the cost of development  sales  marketing and support we are able to eliminate traditional business model inefficiencies and offer innovative solutions with disruptive price performance characteristics to our customers 
for the years ended june   and  our revenue was million  million and million  respectively 
in the same periods  we generated a net income of million  million and million  respectively 
in this annual report on form k we refer to the fiscal years ended june   and as fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
key components of our results of operations and financial condition revenues our revenues are derived principally from the sale of networking hardware and management tools 
in addition  while we do not sell maintenance and support separately  because we have historically included it free of charge in many of our arrangements  we attribute a portion of our systems revenues to this implied post contract customer support pcs 
we classify our revenues into three product categories systems  embedded radios and antennas other 
systems consists of three product categories our proprietary airmax platform products for network operators and service providers  our new platform products which include significant platforms introduced in late fiscal and during which includes the unifi  airvision and airfiber  mfi and edgemax platforms  and other standard products including base stations  radios  backhaul equipment and customer premise equipment cpe 
embedded radios consist of more than radio products primarily for oems  including both point to point and point to multipoint radios in the to ghz spectrum  that are offered with a variety of features 
antennas other consist of antenna products in the to ghz spectrum  as well as miscellaneous products such as mounting brackets  cables and power over ethernet adapters 
these products include both high performance sector and directional antennas 
this category also includes our allocation of revenues to pcs 
we sell substantially all of our products through a limited number of distributors and other channel partners  such as resellers and oems 
sales to distributors accounted for  and of our revenues in the years ended june   and  respectively 
other channel partners  such as resellers and oems  largely accounted for the balance of our revenues 
we sell our products without any right of return 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues is comprised primarily of the costs of procuring finished goods from our contract manufacturers and chipsets that we consign to certain of our contract manufacturers 
in addition  cost of revenues includes tooling  labor and other costs associated with engineering  testing and quality assurance  warranty costs  stock based compensation  logistics related fees and excess and obsolete inventory 
in addition to utilizing contract manufacturers  we outsource our logistics warehousing and order fulfillment functions  which are located primarily in china  and to a lesser extent  taiwan 
we also evaluate and utilize other vendors for various portions of our supply chain from time to time 
our operations organization consists of employees and consultants engaged in the management of our contract manufacturers  new product introduction activities  logistical support and engineering 
gross profit our gross profit has been  and may in the future be  influenced by several factors including changes in product mix  target end markets for our products  pricing due to competitive pressure  production costs  foreign exchange rates and global demand for electronic components 
although we procure and sell our products in us dollars  our contract manufacturers incur many costs  including labor costs  in other currencies 
to the extent that the exchange rates move unfavorably for our contract manufacturers  they may try to pass these additional costs on to us  which could have a material impact on our future average selling prices and unit costs 

table of contents operating expenses we classify our operating expenses as research and development and sales  general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses  including stock based compensation  for employees and costs for contractors engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as costs for prototypes  facilities and travel 
over time  we expect our research and development costs to increase as we continue making significant investments in developing new products and developing new versions of our existing products 
sales  general and administrative expenses include salary and benefit expenses  including stock based compensation  for employees and costs for contractors engaged in sales  marketing and general and administrative activities  as well as the costs of legal expenses  trade shows  marketing programs  promotional materials  bad debt expense  professional services  facilities  general liability insurance and travel 
as our product portfolio and targeted markets expand  we may need to employ different sales models  such as building a direct sales force 
these sales models would likely increase our costs 
over time  we expect our sales  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to continued growth in headcount  expansion of our efforts to register and defend trademarks and patents and to support our business and operations 
deferred revenues and costs in the event that collectability of a receivable from products we have shipped is not probable  we classify those amounts as deferred revenues on our balance sheet until such time as we receive payment of the accounts receivable 
we classify the cost of products associated with these deferred revenues as deferred costs of revenues 
as of june   million of revenue was deferred for transactions where we lacked evidence that collectability of the receivables recorded was reasonably assured 
the related deferred cost of revenues balance was million as of june  at june   we did not have any revenue deferred for transactions where we lacked evidence that collectability of the receivables recorded was reasonably assured 
also included in our deferred revenues is a portion related to pcs obligations that we estimate we will perform in the future 
as of june  and  we had deferred revenues of million and  respectively  related to these obligations 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that provide for different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report as assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and affect the related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and in some instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  our actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
recognition of revenues revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of hardware and management tools  as well as the related implied pcs 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and the collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in cases where we lack evidence that collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  we defer recognition of revenue until the receipt of cash 
for our sales  evidence of the arrangement consists of an order from a customer 
we consider delivery to have occurred once our products have been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for our sales  these criteria are met at the time the products are transferred to the customer shipping agent 
our arrangements with customers do not include provisions for cancellation  returns  inventory swaps or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenues 

table of contents we record amounts billed to distributors for shipping and handling costs as revenues 
we classify shipping and handling costs incurred by us as cost of revenues 
deposit payments received from distributors in advance of recognition of revenues are included in current liabilities on our balance sheet and are recognized as revenues when all the criteria for recognition of revenues are met 
our multi element arrangements generally include two deliverables 
the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale 
the second deliverable is the implied right to pcs included with the purchase of certain products 
pcs is the right to receive  on a when and if available basis  future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product s essential software as well as bug fixes  email and telephone support 
we use a hierarchy to determine the allocation of revenues to the deliverables 
the hierarchy is as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price besp 
i vsoe generally exists only when a company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable 
generally we do not sell the deliverables separately and  as such  do not have vsoe 
ii tpe can be substantiated by determining the price that other parties sell similar or substantially similar offerings 
we do not believe that there is accessible tpe evidence for similar deliverables 
iii besp reflects our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
we believe that besp is the most appropriate methodology for determining the allocation of revenues among the multiple elements 
we have allocated revenues between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method which is based on the besp for all deliverables 
revenues allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for recognition of revenues have been met 
revenues allocated to the pcs are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated life of each of these devices which currently is two years 
all costs of revenues  including estimated warranty costs  are recognized at the time of sale 
costs for research and development and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred 
if the estimated life of the hardware product should change  the future rate of amortization of the revenues allocated to pcs would also change 
our process for determining besp for deliverables involves multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
for pcs  we believe our network operators and service providers would be reluctant to pay for such services separately 
this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights do not obligate us to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all  and do not specify to network operators and service providers which upgrades or features will be delivered 
we believe that the relatively low prices of our products and our network operators  and service providers price sensitivity would add to their reluctance to pay for pcs 
therefore  we have concluded that if we were to sell pcs on a stand alone basis  the selling price would be relatively low 
key factors considered by us in developing the besp for pcs include reviewing the activities of specific employees engaged in support and software development to determine the amount of time that is allocated to the development of the undelivered elements  determining the cost of this development effort  and then adding an appropriate level of gross profit to these costs 
inventory our inventories are primarily raw materials  which we have consigned to our contract manufacturers  and to a lesser extent  finished goods 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
we reduce the value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability by the difference between the cost of the affected inventory and the estimated market value 
write downs are not reversed until the related inventory has been subsequently sold or scrapped 
product warranties we offer warranties on certain products and record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with potential warranty claims 
these warranty costs are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income within cost of revenues 
our warranties are in effect for months from the distributors purchase date of the product 
our estimates of future warranty costs are largely based on historical experience of product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if future warranty claims exceed historical experiences and we are not able to recover costs from our contract manufacturers 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated probable losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance  management considers  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each distributor based on payment history and general economic conditions 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we expect to realize 
the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including current operating results  the forecast of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning initiatives 
in addition  our calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we may be subject to income tax audits in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and  as a result  must also assess exposures to any potential issues arising from current or future audits of current and prior years tax returns 
accordingly  we must assess such potential exposures and  where necessary  provide a reserve to cover any expected loss 
to the extent that we establish a reserve  our provision for income taxes would be increased 
we review our potential liabilities periodically and  if necessary  record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that tax liability is greater than our original estimate 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
stock based compensation we record stock based awards at fair value as of the grant date and recognize expense ratably on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting term of the awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
restricted stock units are valued based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
since our initial public offering on october   the fair value of our common stock is determined using the closing market price of our common stock as of the date of grant

the decrease in our airmax product line was partially offset by increased sales in our new platforms category  which includes platforms introduced since late fiscal our new platforms contributed million and million of revenue during fiscal and  respectively 
our other systems revenue decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to our december quarter including a large order to a single direct customer and further adoption of our airmax solutions in we anticipate that our other systems products will decline in future periods as sales of these products are outpaced by airmax and new platform products 
embedded radio revenues decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we anticipate that embedded radio products will decline as a percentage of revenues in future periods as sales of these legacy products are outpaced by sales of systems products 
antennas other revenues increased million  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in antennas other revenues during fiscal was due primarily to continued expansion of core infrastructure build outs in our wireless markets 
we anticipate that antenna other revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods but will decline as a percentage of total revenues due to more rapid growth of systems revenues 

table of contents revenues by geography we generally forward products directly from our manufacturers to our customers via logistics distribution hubs in asia 
beginning in the quarter ended december   our products were predominantly routed through a third party logistics provider in china and prior to the quarter ended december   our products were predominantly delivered to our customers through distribution hubs in hong kong 
our logistics provider  in turn  ships to other locations throughout the world 
we have determined the geographical distribution of our product revenues based on our customers ship to destinations 
a majority of our sales are to distributors who in turn sell to resellers or directly to end customers 
we believe the decline in revenues in all regions  and most significantly in south america  during the fiscal year ended june  as compared to june  was primarily driven by the proliferation of counterfeit versions of our products  which has also created customer uncertainty regarding the authenticity of their potential purchases

as of june   we held million of our million of cash and cash equivalents in accounts of our subsidiaries outside of the united states and we will incur significant tax liabilities if we decide to repatriate those amounts 
on june   we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share  which included  shares sold in connection with the partial exercise of the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters 
all of the shares sold in the offering were sold by our existing stockholders  including entities affiliated with summit partners  lp  and our chief executive officer  robert j 
pera 
we did not sell any shares in the offering  and as such  we did not receive any proceeds from the offering 
we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash and cash equivalent balances and future united states operating cash flows are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and debt repayment obligations 
stock split in october  we completed a for one forward stock split of our common and preferred stock 
all share and per share information set forth herein has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the split 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we lease our headquarters in san jose  california and other locations worldwide under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal in december  we entered into an agreement to lease approximately  square feet of office and research and development space located in san jose  california  which we use as our corporate headquarters 
the lease term is from april   though july  the lease has been categorized as an operating lease  and the total estimated lease obligation is approximately million 
on august   we entered into the loan agreement with us bank  as syndication agent  and east west bank  as administrative agent for the lenders party to the loan agreement 
the loan agreement provides for i a million revolving credit facility  with a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sublimit for the making of swingline loan advances  and ii a million term loan facility 
we may request borrowings under the 
table of contents revolving credit facility until august  on august   we borrowed million of term loans under the term loan facility bringing the total borrowed to million  and no borrowings remain available thereunder 
on november   we borrowed million under the revolving credit facility 
on december  we borrowed an additional million under the revolving credit facility  and million remains available for borrowing thereunder 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period less than year years years over years total in thousands operating leases debt payment obligations interest payments on debt payment obligations total we subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products 
during the normal course of business  our contract manufacturers procure components based upon orders placed by us 
if we cancel all or part of the orders  we may still be liable to the contract manufacturers for the cost of the components purchased by the subcontractors to manufacture our products 
we periodically review the potential liability and to date no significant accruals have been recorded 
our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate the contract manufacturers for any unrecorded liabilities incurred 
as of june   we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and an additional  for gross interest classified as noncurrent liabilities 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
commitments and contingencies in january  the us department of commerce s bureau of industry and security s office of export enforcement oee contacted us to request that we provide information related to our relationship with a logistics company in the united arab emirates uae and with a company in iran  as well as information on the export classification of our products 
as a result of this inquiry we  assisted by outside counsel  conducted a review of our export transactions from through march to not only gather information responsive to the oee s request but also to review our overall compliance with export control and sanctions laws 
we believe our products have been sold into iran by third parties 
we do not believe that we directly sold  exported or shipped our products into iran or any other country subject to a us embargo 
however  until early  we did not prohibit our distributors from selling our products into iran or any other country subject to a us embargo 
in the course of this review we identified that two distributors may have sold ubiquiti products into iran 
our review also found that while we had obtained required commodity classification rulings for our products in june and november  we did not advise our shipping personnel to change the export authorizations used on our shipping documents until february during the course of our export control review  we also determined that we had failed to maintain adequate records for the five year period required by the ear and the sanctions regulations due to our lack of infrastructure and because it was prior to our transition to our current system of record  netsuite 
see risk factors we are subject to numerous us export control and economic sanctions laws and a substantial majority of our sales are into countries outside of the united states 
although we did not intend to do so  we have violated certain of these laws in the past  and we cannot currently assess the nature and extent of any fines or other penalties  if any  that us governmental agencies may impose against us or our employees for any such violations 
any fines  if materially different from our estimates  or other penalties  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in may  we filed a self disclosure statement with the bis and the oee and  in june we filed a self disclosure statement with the us department of the treasury s office of foreign asset control ofac  regarding the compliance issues noted above 
the disclosures address the above described findings and the remedial actions we have taken to date 
however  the findings also indicate that both distributors continued to sell  directly or indirectly  our products into iran during the period from february through march and that we received various communications from them indicating that they were continuing to do so 
since january  we have cooperated with oee and  prior to our disclosure filing  we informally shared with the oee the substance of our findings with respect to both distributors 
from may to august  we provided additional information regarding our review and our findings to oee to facilitate its investigation and oee advised us in august that it had completed its investigation of us 
in august  we received a warning letter from oee 
table of contents stating that oee had not referred the findings of our review for criminal or administrative prosecution of us and closed the investigation of us without penalty 
ofac is still reviewing our voluntary disclosure 
in our submission  we have provided ofac with an explanation of the activities that led to the sales of our products in iran and the failure to comply with the ear and ofac sanctions 
although our ofac and oee voluntary disclosures covered similar sets of facts  which led oee to resolve the case with the issuance of a warning letter  ofac may conclude that our actions resulted in violations of us export control and economic sanctions laws and warrant the imposition of penalties that could include fines  termination of our ability to export our products and or referral for criminal prosecution 
the penalties may be imposed against us and or our management 
the maximum civil monetary penalty for the violations is up to  or twice the value of the transaction  whichever is greater  per violation 
any such fines or restrictions may be material to our financial results in the period in which they are imposed 
also  disclosure of our conduct and any fines or other action relating to this conduct could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot predict when ofac will complete its review or decide upon the imposition of possible penalties 
while we have taken actions designed to ensure that export classification information is distributed to the appropriate personnel in a timely manner and have adopted policies and procedures to promote our compliance with applicable export laws and regulations  including obtaining written distribution agreements with substantially all of our distributors that contain covenants requiring compliance with us export control and economic sanctions law  notifying all of our distributors of their obligations and obtaining updated distribution agreements from distributors that account for approximately of our distributor revenue in fiscal however we cannot be sure such actions will be effective 
additionally  our failure to amend all our distribution agreements and to implement more robust compliance controls immediately after the discovery of iran related sales activity in early may be aggravating factors that could impact the imposition of penalties imposed on us or our management 
based on the facts known to us to date  we recorded an expense of million for this export compliance matter in fiscal  which represents management s estimated exposure for fines in accordance with applicable accounting literature 
this amount was calculated from information discovered through our internal review and we deem this loss to be probable and reasonably estimable 
however  we believe that it is reasonably possible that the loss may be higher  but we cannot reasonably estimate the range of any further potential losses 
should additional facts be discovered in the future and or should actual fines or other penalties substantially differ from our estimates  our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations would be materially negatively impacted 
warranties and indemnifications our products are generally accompanied by a month warranty  which covers both parts and labor 
generally the distributor is responsible for the freight costs associated with warranty returns  and we absorb the freight costs of replacing items under warranty 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb s  accounting standards codification asc   loss contingencies  we record an accrual when we believe it is estimable and probable based upon historical experience 
we record a provision for estimated future warranty work in cost of goods sold upon recognition of revenues and we review the resulting accrual regularly and periodically adjust it to reflect changes in warranty estimates 
we may in the future enter into standard indemnification agreements with many of our distributors and oems  as well as certain other business partners in the ordinary course of business 
these agreements may include provisions for indemnifying the distributor  oem or other business partner against any claim brought by a third party to the extent any such claim alleges that a ubiquiti product infringes a patent  copyright or trademark or violates any other proprietary rights of that third party 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not estimable 
we have agreed to indemnify our directors  officers and certain other employees for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while such persons are or were serving at our request in such capacity 
we may terminate the indemnification agreements with these persons upon the termination of their services with us but termination will not affect claims for indemnification related to events occurring prior to the effective date of termination 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited 
we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our potential exposure 
we believe the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
we had not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of june  or based upon our historical experience and information known as of the date of this report  we do not believe it is likely that we will have significant liability for the above indemnities at june  off balance sheet arrangements as of june  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements other than those indemnification agreements described above 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting standard update on the financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits 
the new guidance provides that a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit would be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a new operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed 
the new guidance will become effective for us on july  and it should be applied prospectively to unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date with retrospective application permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact of this new guidance 
non gaap financial measures regulation g  conditions for use of non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
to supplement our consolidated financial results presented in accordance with gaap  we use non gaap financial measures which are adjusted from the most directly comparable gaap financial measures to exclude certain items  as described below 
management believes that these non gaap financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results  provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting our business and operations 
non gaap financial measures used by us include net income or loss and diluted net income or loss per share 
our non gaap measures primarily exclude stock based compensation  net of taxes and other special charges and credits 
additionally  in fiscal we had a gain of million from a trademark coexistence agreement 
management believes these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our strategic and business decision making  internal budgeting  forecasting and resource allocation processes 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures facilitate management s internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors operating results 
we use each of these non gaap financial measures for internal managerial purposes  when providing our financial results and business outlook to the public and to facilitate period to period comparisons 
management believes that these non gaap measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational and financial performance of current and historical results 
management uses these non gaap measures for strategic and business decision making  internal budgeting  forecasting and resource allocation processes 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures facilitate management s internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors operating results 
the following table shows our non gaap financial measures years ended june  in thousands  except per share amounts non gaap net income and comprehensive income non gaap diluted net income per share of common stock we believe that providing these non gaap financial measures  in addition to the gaap financial results  are useful to investors because they allow investors to see our results through the eyes of management as these non gaap financial measures reflect our internal measurement processes 
management believes that these non gaap financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of our operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis and provides investors with another method for assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of our ongoing operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we have interest rate risk from the libor index that is used to determine the interest rates on our loan agreement 
interest will accrue on the outstanding principal amount of the term loan at a rate per annum equal to an adjusted libor rate based on one  two or three month interest periods plus a spread of either or  which spread shall be determined based on the debt service ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period 
the loans bear interest  at our option  at the base rate plus a spread of to or an adjusted libor rate at our election for a period of   or days plus a spread of to  in each case with such spread being determined based on our debt service coverage ratio for the most recently ended fiscal quarter 
the base rate is the highest of i east west bank s prime rate  ii the federal funds rate plus a margin equal to  or iii the libor rate plus a margin equal to 
based on a sensitivity analysis  as of june   an instantaneous and sustained basis point increase in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt obligations  and assuming that we take no counteractive measures  would result in a charge to our income provision for before income taxes in excess of million over the next months 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of june  and  respectively 
these amounts were held primarily in cash deposit accounts 
the fair value of our cash equivalents would not be significantly affected by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of these instruments 

table of contents foreign currency risk most of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  our revenues are not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located  and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the chinese yuan  lithuanian lita and taiwan dollar 
during the fiscal year ended june   a appreciation or depreciation in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which our expenses are denominated would not have had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
