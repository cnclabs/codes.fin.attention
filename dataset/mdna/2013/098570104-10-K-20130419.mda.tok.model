as of february   the company employed approximately  full and part time employees 
one of the company s growth strategies is focused on opening stores in new and existing market areas 
in addition to opening new stores  management intends to continue its practice of reviewing the profitability trends and prospects of existing stores and closing or relocating under performing stores 
during fiscal  the company opened stores  closed stores and relocated one store 
the company s performance is partially measured based on comparable store sales  which is similar to most retailers 
comparable store sales are determined each fiscal quarter during the year based on all stores that have been open at least full months as of the first day of the fiscal period 
any stores closed during a fiscal quarter are included in comparable store sales until they close 
remodeled and relocated stores are also included as comparable stores 
the factors affecting the future trend of comparable store sales include  among others  overall demand for products that the company sells  the company s marketing programs  pricing strategies  store operations and competition including competition from e commerce

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods presented 
fiscal year ended february  january  weeks weeks net revenue gross profit operating  selling and administrative expenses impairment charges depreciation and amortization operating income loss interest expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss before equity method investment net loss on equity method investment net income loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net income loss the financial results for the weeks ended january  contain certain insignificant reclassifications necessary to conform to the presentation of the weeks ended february  fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal reflects an extra week as compared with fiscal  creating a week fiscal year that occurs approximately every six years in the accounting cycle for most retailing companies 
consolidated net revenue from continuing operations increased million  or  to million for the week period ended february   as compared to million for the week period ended january  net revenue for the additional week in fiscal was approximately million 
the remainder of the increase was related to the increase in revenue from the retail trade segment  partially offset by a decrease in the electronic trade segment  each of which is discussed in more detail below 
comparable store sales for the year ended february   decreased when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the comparable store sales decrease was due to sharp declines in sales of e reader devices and decreases in sales in certain book categories  offset by an increase in sales of general merchandise 
our core book department business continues to be negatively impacted by the transition of certain categories to digital formats  but at a lesser rate than anticipated 
several categories outperformed the broader trend  including fiction  graphic novels and the kids area 
gifts  media  electronic accessories and caf sales increased year over year driven by product assortments 
non comparable store sales totaled million during fiscal as compared with non comparable store sales of million during fiscal non comparable store sales were primarily attributable to the sales in stores that we opened in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the additional week of sales in fiscal in addition  the company opened new stores and closed stores during fiscal net sales for the retail trade segment increased million  or  to million in the year ended february   from million in the year ended january  the increase was due to the impact of sales from the net addition of new stores opened in fiscal and and the additional week of sales in fiscal  partially offset by the decrease in comparable store sales 
the decrease in comparable store sales was due to lower sales in certain book categories  offset by an increase in general merchandise 

table of contents net sales for the electronic commerce trade segment decreased million  or  to million in the year ended february   from million in the year ended january  the decrease in net sales for the electronic commerce trade segment was primarily due to lower sales of e reading devices  partially offset by higher internet sales of books and other products on the company s website 
gross profit from continuing operations  which includes cost of sales  distribution costs and occupancy costs  increased million  or  to million in the year ended february   from million in the year ended january  this increase was attributable to higher sales as described above and an improved gross profit rate as a percentage of sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal year to  from in fiscal year the improved gross profit rate was a result of increased sales of higher margin items  such as gifts and general merchandise  lower distribution costs  improved shrink results  and a decrease in the lifo provision  somewhat offset by higher occupancy costs 
operating  selling and administrative expenses from continuing operations increased million  or  to million in the year ended february   from million in the year ended january  the increase was primarily attributable to the extra selling week in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in percentage was attributable to lower store opening and closing costs  lower selling costs as percentage of net sales and lower restricted stock expenses 
impairment charges increased million to million for the year ended february   from million in the year ended january  the increase was primarily due to a fiscal goodwill impairment of million 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained herein  for further discussion of this impairment 
depreciation and amortization expenses from continuing operations increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase was due to the increase in new stores in the last half of fiscal depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to from 
consolidated operating income from continuing operations was million for the year ended february   compared to consolidated operating loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended january   an increase of million 
this increase was attributable to increased sales  improved gross profit as a percentage of sales and lower operating  selling  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales as described above 
interest expense increased million  or  in the year ended february  compared to the year ended january  the increase was due to higher average debt levels  partially offset by lower interest rates 
the effective rate for income tax purposes was for fiscal and for fiscal the net decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a number of factors  most of which are not directly associated with current period earnings 
significant decreases in the effective tax rate are due to changes in uncertain tax positions and federal tax credits recorded during fiscal that resulted in income tax benefits and had the result of reducing the overall effective rate in the current fiscal year 
similar items existed in the prior year but resulted in increases in the effective tax rate due to the existence of a prior period pre tax loss 
the decreases in the effective tax rate as described above are offset by the tax expense impact of a valuation allowance recorded against certain state income tax deferred tax assets in the current fiscal period 
the decrease in the federal statutory rate to in fiscal from in the prior year was the result of full utilization of net operating loss carryback opportunity in the prior year to years with higher tax rates 
the company did not close any stores in fiscal in markets where the company does not expect to retain the closed stores customer base 
the company closed five stores in fiscal in markets where the company does not expect to retain the closed stores customers at another store in the same market 
the operating results of these stores are presented as discontinued in all periods presented 
for fiscal year  the closed stores had sales of million and an after tax operating loss of million 

table of contents critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company believes that the likelihood is remote that materially different amounts will be reported related to actual results for the estimates and judgments described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation on equipment and furniture and fixtures is provided on the straight line method over the estimated service lives  which range from two to ten years 
depreciation of buildings and amortization of leasehold improvements  including remodels  is provided on the straight line basis over the lesser of the assets estimated useful lives ranging from to years or  if applicable  the periods of the leases 
determination of useful asset life is based on several factors requiring judgment by management and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles for depreciable periods 
judgment used by management in the determination of useful asset life could relate to any of the following factors expected use of the asset  expected useful life of similar assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life  and other factors that may impair the economic useful life of the asset 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
improvement costs are capitalized to property accounts and depreciated using applicable annual rates 
the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold  retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts  and the related gain or loss is credited or charged to income 
at february   the company had million of property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  accounting for approximately of the company s total assets 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company evaluates long lived assets for impairment at the individual store level  which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  the company will first compare the carrying amount of the assets to the individual store s estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss calculation is prepared 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the assets to the individual store s fair value based on its estimated discounted future cash flows 
if required  an impairment loss is recorded for that portion of the asset s carrying value in excess of fair value 
impairment losses  excluding goodwill impairment  totaled million in fiscal and for both years presented  the impairment losses related to the retail trade business segment 
goodwill asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and other unamortizable intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually or earlier if there are impairment indicators 
the company first makes a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
if it is determined that impairment testing should be performed  the company performs a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill  as required by asc the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of the impairment 
the company completed its annual impairment test on goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the expected future results of these specific locations  the company determined that an impairment loss of million was necessary  bringing the goodwill balance  which was all in the retail trade business segment  to zero at year end 
for further information on the goodwill impairment  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained herein 

table of contents closed store expenses management considers several factors in determining when to close or relocate a store 
some of these factors are decreases in store sales from the prior year  decreases in store sales from the current year budget  annual measurement of individual store pre tax future net cash flows  indications that an asset no longer has an economically useful life  remaining term of an individual store lease or other factors that would indicate a store in the current location cannot be profitable 
when the company closes or relocates a store  the company charges unrecoverable costs to expense 
such costs include the net book value of abandoned fixtures and leasehold improvements  lease termination costs  costs to transfer inventory and usable fixtures  other costs in connection with vacating the leased location and a provision for future lease obligations  net of expected sublease recoveries 
costs associated with store closings were million and million  including costs related to store closings included in discontinued operations  during fiscal and  respectively 
inventories inventories are counted throughout the fiscal year 
store inventory counts are performed by an independent inventory service  while warehouse inventory counts are performed internally 
all physical inventory counts are reconciled to the company s records 
the company s accrual for inventory shortages is based upon historical inventory shortage results 
cost is assigned to store and warehouse inventories using the retail inventory method 
using this method  store and warehouse inventories are valued by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail method is an averaging method that is widely used within the retail industry 
inventory costing also requires certain significant management estimates and judgments involving markdowns  the allocation of vendor allowances and shrinkage 
these practices affect ending inventories at cost as well as the resulting gross margins and inventory turnover ratios 
the company estimates and accrues shrinkage for the period between the last physical count of inventory and the balance sheet date 
the accrual is calculated based on historical results 
reserves for markdowns are estimated based upon the company s history of liquidating non returnable inventory 
the company utilizes the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories 
the cumulative difference between replacement and current cost of inventory over stated lifo value was million as of february  and million as of january  the estimated replacement cost of inventory at february  was the current first in  first out fifo value of million 
vendor allowances the company receives allowances from its vendors under a variety of programs and arrangements  including merchandise placement and cooperative advertising programs 
the company accounts for these allowances under the provisions of asc  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which addresses the accounting for vendor allowances 
vendor allowances for marketing support in excess of incremental direct costs are reflected as a reduction of inventory costs and recognized in cost of products sold upon the sale of the related inventory 
accrued expenses on a monthly basis  certain material expenses are estimated and accrued to properly record those expenses in the period incurred 
such estimates include those made for payroll and employee benefits costs  occupancy costs and advertising expenses  among other items 
certain estimates are made based upon analysis of historical results 
differences in management s estimates and assumptions could result in accruals that are materially different from the actual results 

table of contents income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that result in temporary differences between the amounts recorded in its financial statements and tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of a realization of a deferred income tax asset 
to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established against the deferred income tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made 
the company accounts for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the company evaluates these unrecognized tax benefits each reporting period 
seasonality and quarterly results similar to many retailers  the company s business is seasonal  with its highest retail sales  gross profit and net income historically occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter 
this seasonal pattern reflects the increased demand for books and gifts experienced during the year end holiday selling season 
working capital requirements are generally highest during the third fiscal quarter and the early part of the fourth fiscal quarter due to the seasonality of the company s business 
the company s results of operations depend significantly upon net sales generated during the fourth fiscal quarter  and any significant adverse trend in the net sales of such period would likely have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations for the full year 
in addition  the company s results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of sales and profits contributed by new stores  as well as other factors 
new stores require the company to incur pre opening expenses and often require several months of operation before generating acceptable sales volumes 
accordingly  the addition of a large number of new stores in a particular quarter could adversely affect the company s results of operations for that quarter 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations  including credit terms from vendors  and borrowings under the credit facility  as described in note  short term borrowing and long term debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained herein 
the maximum and average outstanding borrowings under the credit facility including the face amount of letters of credit issued thereunder during the fifty three week period ended february  were million and million  respectively

this change was primarily due to the timing of income tax payments 

table of contents cash used for accounts payable including related party payables in fiscal was million  compared to cash provided by accounts payable including related party payables in fiscal of million 
the change was due to the timing of vendor payments and additional leverage achieved in fiscal due to the increase in inventory for the new stores opened late in the year with favorable payment terms 
cash provided by accrued expenses was million in fiscal and was due to timing of payments  including taxes other than income taxes  offset by a reduction in deferred rent 
cash used for accrued expenses was million in fiscal and was due to a reduction of deferred rent and a reduction in accrued salaries  wages and benefits  partially offset by an increase in accrued advertising 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal and reflected a net use of cash of and million  respectively 
cash was used to fund capital expenditures for new store openings  renovation and improvements to existing stores  upgrades of the company s warehouse distribution processes  investments in management information systems and real property development 
the million spent in fiscal included the payment of million accrued at the end of fiscal related to new store openings that occurred late in fiscal financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  primarily to purchase treasury stock pursuant to the repurchase program 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  primarily to repay debt million  for dividend payments million and for excess tax decrement from stock based compensation million

guarantees from time to time  the company enters into certain types of agreements that require the company to indemnify parties against third party claims 
generally  these agreements relate to a agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which the company may provide customary indemnification to its vendors and suppliers in respect of actions that they take at the company s request or otherwise on its behalf  b agreements with vendors who publish books or manufacture merchandise specifically for the company to indemnify the vendors against trademark and copyright infringement claims concerning the books published or merchandise manufactured on behalf of the company  c real estate leases  under which the company may agree to indemnify the lessors for claims arising from the company s use of the property and d agreements with the company s directors  officers and employees  under which the company may agree to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their relationship with the company 
the company has directors and officers liability insurance  which  subject to the policy s conditions  provides coverage for indemnification amounts payable by the company with respect to its directors and officers up to specified limits and subject to certain deductibles 

table of contents the nature and terms of these types of indemnities vary
