overview we are a cell therapy company dedicated primarily to the development of novel treatments for cardiovascular disease and soft tissue injuries and burns 
we have a global product development strategy with a focus on the u 
s cardiovascular disease market 
in the us our goal is to bring the cytori cell therapy to market for treatment of refractory heart failure through cytori sponsored clinical development efforts and to develop a treatment for thermal burns combined with radiation injury under a contract from barda  a division of the us department of health and human services 
the cytori cell therapy is a proprietary formulation of stem and regenerative cells derived from a patient s own adipose fat tissue adrcs 
adipose tissue is a rich and accessible source of adrcs 
to access these cells from a patient at the time of a surgical procedure  we have designed and developed a sophisticated tissue processing system  the celution system  which automates the complex process of digesting fat tissue  releasing the adrcs  and concentrating them into an optimized and proprietary formulation in a sterile environment 
the system is comprised of a central device and requires single use  per procedure consumable cartridges 
the business model is based on the sale of the central device and generating recurring revenue from the cartridges that are utilized in each procedure 
while our focus is on the development of new therapeutic applications for cytori s cell therapy  we are currently commercializing the celution system under select medical device clearances in europe  japan  and other regions 
the early sales of systems  consumables and ancillary products contributes margins that partially offset our operating expenses and play an important strategic role in fostering familiarity within the medical community with our technology and to facilitate the discovery of potential new applications for cytori s cell therapy by customers conducting investigator initiated and funded research 
in february  we received a ce mark for intravase  a reagent intended to be used with cytori s celution system for preparing safe and optimized adrcs for intravascular delivery into the same patient 
as a result of this approval  we currently plan to target select centers in europe to build patient data  which we believe can be used to further expand these claims and increase celution adoption 
the approval will also allow independent european investigators to conduct their own vascular studies 

table of contents we have also refined our corporate priorities to focus on what we believe represents the greatest near term value to our shareholders with our existing capital resources 
as part of this strategy  we are going to reduce our investment in our european heart attack trial  advance until such time as additional resources are available 
this will provide us with flexibility to invest more in areas of higher strategic importance such as in the athena refractory heart failure trial  and in the government funded activities under our barda contract 
development pipeline the primary therapeutic areas currently within our development pipeline are cardiovascular disease  specifically refractory heart failure due to chronic myocardial ischemia  and the treatment of thermal burns 
in the us  we are conducting our athena trial  a prospective  double blind  placebo controlled  multi center trial in up to patients 
the trial will measure several endpoints  including peak oxygen consumption vo max 
additional endpoints include perfusion defect  left ventricle end systolic and diastolic volume and ejection fraction at six and months 
enrollment is expected to be complete by mid in  we amended our advance trial and enrolled patients across a small number of european trial centers 
patients have been enrolled in advance to date 
in light of the required resources to complete enrollment in an accelerated fashion and competing corporate priorities at this time  we are only prepared to commit a minimal level of investment in advance for the goal for is to bring the total advance enrollment to patients with an interim analysis to be performed after the first patients 
we have completed two european pilot trials investigating cytori s cell therapy for cardiovascular disease 
we have reported long term  month data from the precise trial for chronic myocardial ischemia  which showed that cytori cell therapy demonstrated safety and sustained improvement in cardiac functional capacity as measured by vo max 
results from the apollo trial for acute heart attack demonstrated safety and sustained improvement in infarct size and perfusion 
in addition to our cardiovascular disease therapeutic pipeline  cytori is also developing its cell therapy platform for the treatment of thermal burns combined with radiation injury 
in the third quarter of  we were awarded a contract to develop a new countermeasure for thermal burns valued at up to million with the us department of health and human service s biomedical advanced research and development authority barda 
the initial base period includes million over two years and covers preclinical research and continued development of cytori s celution system to improve cell processing 
the additional contract options  if fully executed  could cover our clinical development through fda approval under a device based pma regulatory pathway 
we are making progress in fulfilling the required milestones of the base contract with the goal of completing the base period in early results of operations product revenues product revenues consisted of revenues primarily from our celution and puregraft systems and stemsource cell banks 
the following table summarizes the components for the years ended december   and years ended related party third party total product revenues attributable to olympus attributable to green hospital supply 
table of contents beginning in march of  we began sales and shipments of our celution crs system to the european and asia pacific reconstructive surgery markets and during we began sales of our puregraft system in the united states and europe 
assuming all other applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  revenue for these product sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer  as all risks and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred to the customer at that point 
for product sales to customers who arrange for and manage all aspects of the shipping process  we recognize revenue upon shipment from our facilities 
beginning in  for product sales that include a combination of equipment  services  or other multiple deliverables that will be provided in the future  we defer an estimate based on the relative selling price method for those future deliverables from product revenue until such deliverables have been provided or earned 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are classified as revenue 
a significant contributor to cytori s product revenue historically and throughout has been sales in japan 
in september we obtained class i device clearance for celution and a number of our other products in japan which led to increased product revenues in the fourth quarter of this clearance is expected to facilitate sales growth in japan and it is anticipated that demand will come mostly from researchers at academic hospitals seeking to perform investigator initiated and funded studies using cytori s cell therapy 
the future we expect to continue to generate product revenues from a mix of celution and stemsource system and consumables sales as well as puregraft orders 
we will sell the products to a diverse group of customers in europe  asia and the us  who may apply the products towards reconstructive surgery  soft tissue repair  research  aesthetics  and cell and tissue banking as approved in each country 
additionally  as a result of class i device clearance for celution and a number of our other products in japan  we anticipate to sell these products to researchers at academic hospitals seeking to perform investigator initiated and funded studies using cytori s cell therapy 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues relate primarily to celution system products and stemsource cell banks and includes material  manufacturing labor  and overhead costs 
the following table summarizes the components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december   and years ended cost of product revenues share based compensation total cost of product revenues total cost of product revenues as of product revenues cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fluctuation in this percentage is to be expected due to the product mix  distributor and direct sales mix  and allocation of overhead 
the future 
we expect to continue to see variation in our gross profit margin as the product mix comprising revenues fluctuates 

table of contents development revenues the following table summarizes the components of our development revenues for the years ended december   and years ended milestone revenue olympus development revenue astellas government contract barda grant revenue regenerative cell storage services other total development revenues we recognize deferred revenues  related party  as development revenue when certain performance obligations are met ie  using a proportional performance approach 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus as a result of two remaining milestones for the apollo and precise clinical trials that were reached upon the completion of all patient follow up procedures and recognition of a regulatory milestone triggered upon us obtaining class i device clearance for celution and a number of our other products in japan 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus as a result of achieving a product development milestone related to additional preproduction development of the celution one system and a regulatory milestone related to our obtaining ce mark claims for the celution one system in europe 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus as a result of achieving two milestones  one in product development for work in preproduction development of the celution one system  and one clinical milestone related to the assessment of trial outcomes at months in one of our cardiac trials 
on december  we raised  in gross proceeds from a sale of  shares of unregistered common stock to astellas pharma inc for per share in a private stock placement 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we granted astellas pharma inc a two year right of first refusal to enter into a development and commercialization collaboration with us regarding the use of our technology  on a worldwide basis  for the treatment of liver conditions 
in addition  we have agreed to use reasonable efforts to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register the shares of common stock for resale upon the request of astellas pharma inc we also granted astellas pharma inc 
a non voting observer seat on our board of directors and the right to designate a representative member to our scientific advisory board 
the  in total proceeds we received exceeded the market value of our stock at the completion of the purchase agreement 
the  difference between the proceeds received and the fair market values of our common stock was initially recorded as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying balance sheet 
this difference was recorded as deferred revenue since  conceptually  the excess proceeds represent a value paid by astellas pharma inc attributable to the scientific advisory board seat  the non voting observer seat on our board of directors  and the two year right of first refusal to enter into a development and commercialization collaboration with us regarding the use of our technology  on a worldwide basis  for the treatment of liver conditions  rather than an additional equity investment in cytori 
we recognized this deferred amount as development revenue upon the expiration of the two year period in december we are still actively involved in discussions with astellas pharma  inc about a potential future development and commercialization collaboration with us 
in the third quarter of  we were awarded a contract to develop a new countermeasure for thermal burns valued at up to million with us department of health and human service s biomedical advanced research and development authority barda 
the initial base period includes million over two years and covers preclinical research and continued development of cytori s celution system to improve cell processing 
the additional contract options  if fully executed  could cover clinical development through fda approval under a device based pma regulatory pathway 
this is a cost reimbursement contract and related government contract revenue was recorded at the gross amount of reimbursement starting in the fourth quarter of to receive funds under this arrangement  we are required to i demonstrate that we incurred qualifying expenses  as defined in the contract agreement between barda and us  ii maintain a system of controls  whereby we can accurately track and report all expenditures related solely to develop a new countermeasure for thermal burns  and iii file appropriate forms and follow appropriate protocols established by barda 
during the year ended december   we incurred  in qualified expenditures 
we recognized a total of  in revenues for the year ended december   which included allowable fees as well as cost reimbursements 
there were no comparable revenues and expenditures for the year ended december  and 
table of contents during the year ended december   we received a  federal grant from the internal revenue service as part of the qualifying therapeutic discovery program qtdp 
the qtdp  administered by the department of health and human services and the department of the treasury  was enacted to encourage biomedical research for projects that show the greatest potential to create and sustain high quality  high paying us jobs and to advance us competitiveness in life  biological and medical sciences 
through this program  eligible companies elected to receive either a cash grant or a tax credit 
we elected to receive a cash grant and the funds were received during late the future we expect to continue recognizing government contract revenue relating to our contract with barda as we continue our development work relating to this contract 
additionally  we may recognize additional development revenues during  as the anticipated completion for the remaining revenue recognition milestone related to our joint venture with olympus is in the cash related to the joint venture agreements was received when these agreements were signed and no further related cash payments will be made to us even if we recognize additional development revenue related to the joint venture 
to date  of the  originally deferred  we have recognized a total of  through december  research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  regulatory fees  the purchase of laboratory supplies  pre clinical studies and clinical studies 
the following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and years ended research and development development milestone joint venture stock based compensation total research and development expenses research and development expenses relate to the development of a technology platform that involves using adipose tissue as a source of autologous regenerative cells for therapeutic applications 
these expenses  in conjunction with continued development efforts related to our celution system  result primarily from the broad expansion of our research and development efforts enabled by the funding we received from olympus in and and from other investors during the last few years 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in increased due to the increase in salary and related benefits expense excluding share based compensation of  an increase in professional services expenses of  increase in research supplies expense of  and increase in clinical study expense of  due to increase in our clinical and regulatory activities 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to the increase in salary and related benefits expense excluding share based compensation of  due to increase in headcount in our research and development departments 
expenditures related to the joint venture with olympus  which are included in the variation analysis above  include costs that are necessary to support the commercialization of future generation devices  including the next generation celution system 
these development activities  which began in november  include performing pre clinical and clinical studies  seeking regulatory approval  and performing product development related to therapeutic applications for adipose stem and regenerative cells for multiple large markets 
the costs associated with the development of the device were comprised of labor and related benefits  consulting and other professional services  supplies and other miscellaneous expenses 

table of contents the future we expect research and development expenditures to increase in as we continue enrollment in our us trial athena  limited enrollment in the advance cardiac trial  continue development work under our barda contract  and as we seek additional regulatory clearances and potentially seek to initiate additional trials or patient registries during sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include costs of sales and marketing personnel  tradeshows  physician training  and promotional activities and materials 
the following table summarizes the components of our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december   and years ended sales and marketing stock based compensation total sales and marketing the decrease in sales and marketing expense during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was mainly attributed to the decrease in salary and related benefits expense excluding share based compensation of  due to a decrease in headcount  and a decrease in professional services expenses of  as a result of targeted reductions in staff and external costs made prior to year end in as well as subsequent reductions made in early the increase in sales and marketing expense during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was mainly attributed to the increase in salary and related benefits expense excluding share based compensation of  due to an increase in headcount in anticipation of us regulatory approval that did not occur in and an increase in professional services of  the future 
we expect sales and marketing expenditures to remain relatively stable in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs for administrative personnel  legal and other professional expenses  and general corporate expenses 
the following table summarizes the general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and years ended general and administrative stock based compensation total general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the general and administrative expenses excluding share based compensation remained relatively consistent 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in general and administrative expenses excluding share based compensation occurred primarily due to an increase in professional services expense of  related mostly to legal costs incurred in connection with european patent validations and maintenance of the worldwide patent estate 
the future 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively stable in stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation expenses include charges related to options and restricted stock awards issued to employees  directors and non employees along with charges related to the employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan espp 
we measure stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of any awards granted to our employees 
such expense is recognized over the period of time that employees provide service to us and earn all rights to the awards 

table of contents the following table summarizes the components of our stock based compensation for the years ended december   and years ended cost of product revenues research and development related sales and marketing related general and administrative related total stock based compensation most of the share based compensation expenses for the years ended december   and related to the vesting of stock option and restricted stock awards to employees 
the increase in share based compensation for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to the grant of restricted stock awards and performance based stock awards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for disclosure and discussion of share based compensation 
the future 
we expect to continue to grant options and stock awards which will result in an expense to our employees  directors  and  as appropriate  to non employee service providers 
in addition  previously granted options will continue to vest in accordance with their original terms 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to non vested stock options and stock awards not yet recognized for all our plans is approximately  of this amount   is expected to be recognized as a result of vesting under service conditions over a weighted average period of years 
change in fair value of warrant liability the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of warrant liability for the years ended december   and years ended december  change in fair value of warrant liability changes in fair value of our warrant liability are primarily due to fluctuations in the valuation inputs  such as stock price  volatility  remaining life and others 
see note to the consolidated condensed financial statements included elsewhere herein for disclosure and discussion of our warrant liability 
the future future changes in the fair value of the warrant liability will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire in august change in fair value of option liability the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of option liability for the years ended december   and years ended change in fair value of option liability changes in fair value of our put option liability are due to changes in assumptions used in estimating the value of the put  such as bankruptcy threshold for cytori  fair value of the olympus cytori  inc joint venture  volatility and others 
see note to the consolidated condensed financial statements included elsewhere herein for disclosure and discussion of our put option liability 

table of contents the future the put has no expiration date 
accordingly  we will continue to recognize a liability for the put until it is exercised or until the arrangements with olympus are amended 
financing items the following table summarizes interest income  interest expense  and other income and expenses for the years ended december   and years ended interest income interest expense other income expense  net total interest expense increased for the year ended december  and december  as compared to prior years due to cash interest and non cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount for our million term loan 
in september  we entered into a second amendment to the amended and restated loan and security agreement  pursuant to which the lenders funded an additional principal  increasing the total principal balance to million 
the changes in other income expense in  and resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the future interest income earned in will be dependent on our levels of funds available for investment as well as general economic conditions 
subject to our future financing activities  we expect interest expense in to remain relatively stable as we continue to pay interest on the million term loan that was amended in september equity loss from investment in joint venture the following table summarizes equity loss from investment in joint venture for the years ended december   and years ended equity loss from investment in joint venture the losses relate entirely to our equity interest in the joint venture  which we account for using the equity method of accounting 
the future we do not expect to recognize significant losses from the activities of the joint venture in the foreseeable future 
we are engaged in ongoing discussions with olympus relating to the future of the joint venture relationship  including the potential termination of the joint venture 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources short term and long term liquidity the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures at december  and as of december  cash and cash equivalents current assets current liabilities working capital we incurred net losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have an accumulated deficit of  as of december  additionally  we have used net cash of   and  to fund our operating activities for years ended december   and  respectively 
to date  these operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital and gross profits 
during  we expanded our commercialization activities while simultaneously pursuing available financing sources to support operations and growth 
we have had  and we will likely continue to have  an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our future operations 
we believe we have sufficient cash to fund operations into the third quarter of  which includes minimum liquidity requirements of the amended and restated loan and security agreement  which requires that we make principal payments of  per month along with accrued interest throughout and maintain at least three months of cash on hand 
in order to fund operations and our continued commercialization efforts through the next twelve months  we are pursuing additional funding through either strategic corporate partnerships  debt restructuring or future issuances of equity or debt securities in addition to our gross profits 
we have an established history of raising capital through all these platforms  and are currently involved in negotiations with multiple parties 
in the absence of sufficient positive cash flows from operations  no assurance can be given that we can generate sufficient revenue to cover operating costs or that additional financing will be available to us and  if available  on terms acceptable to us in the future 
without this additional capital  cash generated from sales and containment of costs will not provide adequate funding indefinitely at their current levels 
if we cannot raise sufficient capital  we would need to reduce our research  development  and administrative operations  including reductions of our employee base and the deferral of ongoing development projects  to focus almost entirely on the supply of current products to existing distribution channels and our thermal burn contract arrangement with barda 
as a result  such reductions would negatively affect our ability to achieve certain other corporate goals

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure we are not subject to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates on our long term obligations as they bear a fixed rate of interest 
our exposure relates primarily to short term investments  including funds classified as cash equivalents 
as of december   all excess funds were invested in money market funds and other highly liquid investments  therefore our interest rate exposure is not considered to be material 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our activities in europe and japan 
transaction gains or losses resulting from cash balances and revenues have not been significant in the past and we are not currently engaged in any hedging activity in the euro  the yen or other currencies 
based on our cash balances and revenues derived from markets other than the united states for the year ended december   a hypothetical adverse change in the euro or yen against the us dollar would not result in a material foreign currency exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such sales denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
