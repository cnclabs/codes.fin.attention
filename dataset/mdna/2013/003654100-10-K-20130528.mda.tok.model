these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of mechanical circulatory support devices and we offer a continuum of care to heart failure patients 
we develop  manufacture and market proprietary products that are designed to enable the heart to rest  heal and recover by improving blood flow and or performing the pumping function of the heart 
our products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab  or cath lab  by interventional cardiologists and in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support prophylactically or emergently before  during or after angioplasty or heart surgery procedures 
we believe heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for patients experiencing heart failure because it restores their quality of life 
in addition  we believe that for the care of such patients  heart recovery is the most cost effective solution for the healthcare system 
our strategic focus and the driver of the majority of our revenue growth is the market penetration of our impella family of products  and principally our impella product  which received k clearance in june from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for partial circulatory support for up to six hours 
we received k clearance in april for our impella and impella ld devices for circulatory support for up to six hours 
these devices are larger and provide more blood flow to patients than the impella in september  we announced that our impella cp product received k clearance from the fda for circulatory support for up to six hours 
the impella cp previously marketed outside of the us as impella cvad received ce mark approval to market the device in the european union and health canada approval to market the device in canada 
we initiated a controlled launch with top heart hospitals in the us during the second quarter of fiscal and have continued a controlled commercial launch of impella cp to more hospitals in the us  which we expect to continue over the next months 
in november  we announced that the impella rp received investigational device exemption  or ide  approval from the fda for use in recover right  a pivotal clinical study in the us the impella rp is a percutaneous catheter based axial flow pump that is designed to allow greater than four liters of flow per minute and is intended to provide the flow and pressure needed to compensate for right side heart failure 
in april  we announced the enrollment of the first patient in recover right and we expect to enroll patients with signs of right side heart failure and are being treated in the cath lab or surgery suite 
we are also conducting initial patient use trials of the impella rp outside of the us this product is not currently available for commercial use 
in december  as part of the fda s program initiative  an fda panel voted to recommend continuation of class iii status for temporary ventricular support devices within the non roller type cardiopulmonary bypass blood pumps category  which includes our impella products 
the panel s recommendation of class iii for this category of device is consistent with the current class iii designation for these device types 
if the fda accepts the panel s determination and issues a final order classifying these devices in class iii  we will be required to file a pma application for impella under the program initiative  we will be permitted to continue to market our impella products pursuant to the k clearance for a sufficient period of time to allow for the submission and review of pma applications relating to our impella products 
we intend to submit a modular pma submission for impella by the end of fiscal a modular pma allows for a parallel submission of preclinical and manufacturing data for review while still preparing the clinical module 
we are working with the fda to prepare this modular pma application for our impella products 
in november  we announced symphony  a synchronized minimally invasive implantable cardiac assist device designed to treat chronic patients with moderate heart failure by improving patient hemodynamics and potentially improving their quality of life 
the device is designed with the primary goal of stabilizing the progression of heart failure and recovering or remodeling the heart 
we are currently conducting first in human clinical trials of symphony outside the us this product is not currently approved by the fda for sale in the us on october   we were informed that the united states attorney s office for the district of columbia is conducting an investigation that is focused on the company s marketing and labeling of the impella on october   we accepted service of a subpoena related to this investigation 
the subpoena seeks documents related to the impella we are in the process of responding and we intend to cooperate fully with the subpoena 
on november and   two purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers in the us district court for the district of massachusetts by alleged purchasers of our common stock  on behalf of themselves and persons or entities that purchased or acquired our securities between august  and october  the complaints allege that the defendants violated the 
table of contents federal securities laws in connection with disclosures related to the fda and the marketing and labeling of our impella product and seek damages in an unspecified amount 
the court has consolidated these complaints 
a consolidated amended complaint was filed by the plaintiffs on may  additionally  on february   an alleged holder of our common stock filed a derivative action on our behalf against each of our directors in the us district court for the district of massachusetts 
the complaint alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders in connection with disclosures related to the fda and the marketing and labeling of our impella product and seeks damages in an unspecified amount 
we have moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety  and that motion has been briefed  argued and is under advisement by the court 
separately  on january  and february   we received demands from purported stockholders to inspect certain of our books and records related to these matters 
in november  we announced that the impella rp received investigational device exemption  or ide  approval from the fda for use in a pivotal clinical study in the us the impella rp is a percutaneous catheter based axial flow pump that is designed to allow greater than four liters of flow per minute and is intended to provide the flow and pressure needed to compensate for right side heart failure 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the enrollment of the first patient in recover right  an investigational device exemption ide study of impella rp right peripheral 
we are also conducting initial patient use trials of the impella rp outside of the us this product is not currently available for commercial use 
our revenues are primarily generated from our impella line of products 
revenues from our non impella products  largely focused on the heart surgery suite  have been lower recently as we have strategically shifted our sales and marketing efforts towards our impella products and the cath lab 
we expect revenues from our non impella products  including bvs and ab  will continue to decrease as we continue to focus on our impella products 
for the year ended march   we recognized net income of million 
with the exception of fiscal and  we have incurred net losses since our inception 
even though we were profitable in fiscal  we may incur additional losses in the future as we continue to invest in research and development related to our products  conduct clinical studies and registries on our products  expand our commercial infrastructure  pay additional excise taxes as a result of the implementation of the medical device tax in the us in january  incur additional legal fees to comply with the subpoena received from the department of justice in october  defend ourselves from other legal claims and invest in new markets such as japan 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectability of receivables  realizability of inventory  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of long lived assets  accrued expenses  warranty provisions  stock based compensation  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  contingencies and litigation 
provisions for depreciation are based on their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
some of these estimates can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to customers is recognized when delivery has occurred 
all costs related to product sales are recognized at time of delivery 
we do not provide for rights of return to customers on our product sales and therefore do not record a provision for returns 
maintenance and service support contract revenues are included in product revenue and are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
revenue is recognized as it is earned in limited instances where we rent console medical devices to customers on a month to month basis or for a longer specified period of time 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
under contracts in which we elect to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  we prospectively recognize revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as related research and development costs are incurred 

table of contents goodwill goodwill is recorded when consideration for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  instead we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at october  as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value  no further procedures are required 
however  if the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  an impairment of goodwill may exist  requiring a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
we estimate the fair value of our single reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow method in which the estimated future cash flows and terminal values for the reporting unit is discounted to a present value using an appropriate discount rate 
cash flow projections are based on management s estimates of economic and market conditions which drive key assumptions of revenue growth rates  operating margins  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the discount rate is based on the specific risk characteristics of the reporting unit and its underlying forecast 
the market approach estimates fair value by comparing publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit 
the fair values determined by the market approach and income approach  are weighted to determine the fair value for the reporting unit based primarily on the similarity of the operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit to the comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach 
in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit s fair value  we also compare the reporting unit s fair value to our market capitalization per share stock price times number of common shares outstanding and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the reporting unit s fair value over the market capitalization 
we performed our annual impairment review for fiscal as of october  and determined that no write down for impairment of goodwill was required as the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value 
the carrying amount of goodwill at march  was million 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation in our statements of operations based on the fair value method 
this expense is determined after consideration of several significant judgments and estimates  including the probable outcome for awards with a performance condition or conditions 
the fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of our stock 
in addition  an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because we do not pay dividends and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we estimate the expected term of options based on historical exercise experience and estimates of future exercises of unexercised options 
forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures  adjusted to the extent historic forfeitures may not be indicative of forfeitures in the future 
for awards with service conditions only  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with service and performance conditions  we recognize compensation costs using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period 
accruals of compensation cost for awards with performance conditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions 
the cumulative effects of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur 
income taxes our provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment 
in determining whether our deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable  we evaluated all available positive and negative evidence  and weighted the evidence based on its objectivity 
evidence we considered included  net operating losses incurred from our inception to march   expiration of various federal and state attributes  the uncertainty relative to the department of justice investigation and our planned pma application for our impella products  profits before tax for fiscal and and forecasted profit before tax for fiscal based on our review of all available evidence  we determined that the objectively verifiable negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realizable as of march  accounting for income taxes requires a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if  based on the technical merits  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax laws  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we accrue for the effects of uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest

other product revenue includes ab  bvs and cannulae product sales 
service and other revenue represents revenue earned on preventative maintenance service contracts and maintenance calls 
total revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in total revenue was primarily due to higher impella revenue due to greater utilization in the us  which was attributable in part to the launch of impella cp in fiscal 
table of contents impella product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal most of our increase in impella revenue was from disposable catheter sales in the us  as we focus on increasing utilization of our disposable catheter products through continued investment in our field organization and physician training program 
in the second half of fiscal  we began our initial launch of impella cp in the us we plan to continue our controlled commercial launch of impella cp during fiscal and we expect impella cp and impella revenues to increase as we add new customer sites and increase utilization at existing customer sites 
other product revenues for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in other revenue was due to a decline in bvs and ab disposable sales 
we are currently only actively selling the bvs upon request and expect that ab revenue will continue to decline in fiscal as we focus our sales efforts in the surgical suite on impella and ld 
service and other revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in preventative maintenance service contracts  as we expand the use of our impella aic consoles 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in cost of product revenues was related to increased impella demand and higher production volume and costs to support the higher demand for impella products 
the decrease in gross margin was related primarily to increased investment in expanding manufacturing capacity to support future demand for impella products  start up costs related to the initial production of impella cp and increased shipments of aic consoles 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses was due to a decrease in clinical trial expenditures as we completed the protect ii trial for the impella and spending on impella cp product development activities decreased in fiscal after the impella cp was approved in the us in september  and was partially offset by an increase in spending on product development initiatives associated with impella rp and symphony 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in fiscal as we continue to focus on new product development initiatives associated with impella rp and symphony 
we will also have additional research and development costs as we prepare our pma application for our existing impella products available for sale in the us and expenses related to obtaining regulatory approval for our impella products in japan 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel expenses related to increased us field sales and clinical headcount  increased spending on marketing initiatives as we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of hemodynamic support and increases in legal expenses 
during fiscal  we incurred legal expenses of approximately million in connection with complying with the subpoena received from the department of justice in october and defense of other legal claims 
we also incurred million of expenses in fiscal for payment of the medical device tax after its implementation in the us in january we expect to continue to increase our expenditures on sales and marketing activities  with particular investments in field sales and clinical personnel with cath lab expertise 
we also plan to increase our marketing  service  and training investments to support the efforts of the sales and field clinical teams to drive recovery awareness for acute heart failure patients 
we also will have additional expenses with the implementation of the medical device tax 
we expect to continue to incur significant legal expenses related to the department of justice investigation  our defense of purported class actions and a derivative action and our response to information requests for the foreseeable future 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition in may we fully amortized the remaining net book value of our intangible assets during the year ended march  income tax provision during fiscal and  we recorded provisions for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision is primarily due to million of income taxes in germany that we do not expect will be offset by our net operating loss 
table of contents carryforwards in germany 
accordingly  we expect to have a tax liability in germany that we will pay in cash 
we have also recorded provisions of million for income taxes related to our deferred tax liability on our goodwill and alternative minimum tax in the us if we continue to be profitable  we expect that income tax expense will increase in the future 
net income during fiscal  we recognized net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share compared to net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in net income in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased impella sales due to greater demand in the us even though we were profitable in fiscal and  we may incur losses in the future as we continue to invest in research and development related to our products  conduct clinical studies and registries on our products  expand our commercial infrastructure  pay additional excise taxes as a result of the implementation of the medical device tax in the us in january  incur additional legal fees to comply with the subpoena received from the department of justice in october and defend ourselves from other legal claims and invest in new markets such as japan

cost of product revenue cost of product revenue for fiscal increased by million or  to million from million for fiscal gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher reorders of impella product disposable pumps and improved manufacturing efficiency 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was due to an increase in spending on product development initiatives associated with 
table of contents impella rp  impella cvad and symphony  and was partially offset by a decrease in clinical trial expenditures as we completed our work associated with the protect ii trial for the impella research and development expenses for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  in clinical trial costs primarily associated with our impella us trials 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increased field headcount as we concentrated our commercial efforts in the us and increased spending on marketing initiatives as we continued to educate physicians on the benefits of hemodynamic support 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 
gain on sale of worldheart stock in december  we made a million investment in worldheart  a developer of an implantable mechanical circulatory support system for chronic heart failure patients 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal  reducing the carrying value of the investment to zero 
in july  the note receivable and warrant were converted into common stock of worldheart 
in fiscal we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million 
in fiscal we sold our remaining  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million 
gain on settlement of investment in december  we received million in proceeds in conjunction with a settlement agreement on an investment 
income tax provision during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision is primarily due to income taxes in germany that we do not expect will be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards in germany and therefore we expect to have a tax liability that we will pay in cash 
we have also recorded provisions for income taxes related to our deferred tax liability on our goodwill and alternative minimum tax in the us net income loss during fiscal  we incurred net income of million  or per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the net income in fiscal compared to the net loss in fiscal was due primarily to increased impella sales due to greater demand in the us liquidity and capital resources at march   our cash  cash equivalents  and short and long term marketable securities totaled million  an increase of million compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities at march  we believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  exclusive of activities involving any future acquisitions of products or companies that complement or augment our existing line of products 
our primary liquidity requirements are to fund the expansion of our commercial infrastructure in the us  increase our impella manufacturing capacity  increase our inventory levels in order to meet increasing customer demand for impella in the us  fund new product development  pay for fees related to the department of justice investigation  our defense of purported class actions and a derivative action  and our response to information requests and provide for general working capital needs 
through march   we have funded our operations principally from product sales and through the sale of equity securities 
we also generate cash through funded research and development revenue 
in november  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock 
we financed the stock repurchase program with our available cash 
during the year ended march   we repurchased  shares for 
table of contents million in open market purchases at an average cost of per share  including commission expense 
we completed the purchase of common stock under this stock repurchase program in january marketable securities at march  consisted of million held in funds that invest in us treasury and government backed securities 
we are not a party to any interest rate swaps  currency hedges or derivative contracts of any type and have no exposure to commercial paper or auction rate securities markets 
during the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million during the same period in the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily attributable to the improvement in net income of million reflected in our net income of million for the year ended march  compared to million in fiscal  supplemented by a million increase in cash provided by accounts receivable due to increases in revenue and timing of receivable collections and a million decrease in cash used for accounts payable  which were offset by a million increase in cash used for accrued expenses primarily related increases in inventory costs and higher personnel expenses as a result of increased headcount and increases in legal expenses  and a million increase in cash used for inventories as we have increased inventory safety stock levels in fiscal to support continued growing customer demand for impella 
in addition  net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by changes in non cash adjustments of a million increase in stock based compensation  partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and a million decrease in write downs of inventory 
during the year ended march   net cash used for investing activities was million  compared to million during the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily attributable to a million increase in proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities  partially offset by a million increase in purchases of marketable securities 
we also had a million increase in cash used for capital expenditures and a million decrease in proceeds upon settlement of an investment in fiscal during the year ended march   net cash used for financing activities was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during the same period in the prior year 
the increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash used for the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase program  an million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options because fewer stock options were exercised in that period as compared to the prior year  and a million increase in payments in lieu of issuance of common stock for minimum payroll taxes upon vesting of certain equity awards 
capital expenditures for fiscal are estimated to range from to million  and are expected to relate primarily to capital expenditures for manufacturing capacity increases for impella  leasehold improvements and software development projects 
cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled million and million at march  and  respectively 
our operating income outside the us is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
we do not intend or currently foresee a need to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
our liquidity is influenced by our ability to sell our products in a competitive industry and our customers ability to pay for our products 
factors that may affect liquidity include our ability to penetrate the market for our products  maintain or reduce the length of the selling cycle  and collect cash from clients after our products are sold 
we also expect to continue to incur legal expenses related to the department of justice investigation  our defense of purported class actions and a derivative action and our response to requests for information for the foreseeable future 
we continue to review our long term cash needs on a regular basis 
at march   we had no long term debt outstanding 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by fiscal year in s total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating lease commitments contractual obligations total obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and expected liabilities under agreements with third parties  primarily for research and development activities  such as clinical trials and material purchases for new product testing 

table of contents we had no long term debt  capital leases or other material commitments for open purchase orders and clinical trial agreements at march  other than those shown in the table above 
our operating lease for our facility in danvers  massachusetts expires on february  monthly rent is as follows the base rent for november through june was  per month  the base rent for july through february is  per month  and the base rent for march through february will be  per month 
in addition  we have certain rights to terminate the lease early  subject to the payment of a specified termination fee based on the timing of the termination  as further outlined in the lease amendment 
we rent our european headquarters in aachen  germany 
the lease payments are approximately  euro approximately us  at march  exchange rates per month 
the existing lease for this space expired on december  we entered into an arrangement with our landlord to continue renting our existing space in aachen at the same monthly rental rate until june  while we negotiate a longer term lease agreement 
we are also party to a license agreement related to certain circulatory care device patents and know how 
under this agreement  we would be obligated to pay up to million in cash or stock  if certain development and regulatory milestones are achieved this amount has not been included in the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty related to the successful achievement of these milestones 
we apply the disclosure provisions of guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
these disclosure provisions require that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance is remote 
the following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor 
we enter into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business  typically with underwriters  contractors  clinical sites and customers that include indemnification provisions 
under these provisions we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements at march  clinical study agreements in our clinical study agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the participating institutions against losses incurred by them for claims related to any personal injury of subjects taking part in the study to the extent they relate to use of our devices in accordance with the clinical study agreement  the protocol for the device and our instructions 
the indemnification provisions contained within our clinical study agreements do not generally include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs related to the indemnification provisions contained in our clinical study agreements 
product warranties we accrue for estimated future warranty costs on our product sales at the time of shipment 
all of our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates 
our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision 
patent indemnifications in many sales transactions  we indemnify customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by our products 
the indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk primary market risk exposures our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
marketable securities at march  consisted of million held in funds that invest in us treasury and government backed securities 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial 

table of contents currency exchange rates we have foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and particularly with respect to the euro  british pound sterling and japanese yen 
therefore  our investment in our subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive loss income component of stockholders equity 
if rates of exchange for the euro  british pound and japanese yen were to have depreciated immediately and uniformly by relative to the us dollar from levels at march   the result would have been a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the estimated fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
considerable judgment is required  however  to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts
