item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ducommun incorporated ducommun  the company  we  us or our  through its subsidiaries  is a leading global provider of engineering and manufacturing services for high performance products and high cost of failure applications used primarily in the aerospace  defense  industrial  energy  and medical industries 
ducommun differentiates itself as a full service provider  offering a wide range of value added products and services in our primary businesses of electronics  structures and integrated solutions 
we operate through two primary business units dlt and das 
during  we continued to execute successfully our plan to integrate labarge s operations and products into our business and expand our capabilities to provide more advanced  complex integrated systems and product offerings 
we also acted on our plan to de lever the balance sheet following the june labarge acquisition by making voluntary term loan principal pre payments totaling million 
for additional information on the labarge acquisition  see part ii  item ducommun incorporated and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements note acquisition and note long term debt 
the labarge acquisition allowed us to expand our presence significantly in the aerospace and defense markets  as well as diversify our customer base across new end use markets  including industrial  natural resources  medical and other commercial end use markets 
more specifically  we realized the following benefits from the labarge acquisition strengthened our market position as a significant tier supplier for both structural and electronic assemblies and integrated products  expanded our platforms work content on existing programs and capabilities on new and existing programs  increased value added manufacturing services content in our product portfolio  expanded our technology product portfolio  and realized potential synergies 
highlights for the year ended december  were as follows net income was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share in  cash generated from operating activities was million  an improvement of million compared to  we made voluntary term loan principal pre payments totaling million  and firm backlog at the end of was a record million  compared to million at the end of 
table of contents for the year ended december   we generated net sales of million and recorded net income of million 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively 
see non gaap financial measures below for certain information regarding ebitda and adjusted ebitda  including reconciliations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income 
non gaap financial measures when viewed with our financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and accompanying reconciliations  we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide additional useful information to clarify and enhance the understanding of the factors and trends affecting our past performance and future prospects 
we define these measures  explain how they are calculated and provide reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure in the tables below 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and the related financial ratios  as presented in this form k  are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
they are not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap  or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as measures of our liquidity 
the presentation of these measures should not be interpreted to mean that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items 
we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda non gaap operating performance measures internally as complementary financial measures to evaluate the performance and trends of our businesses 
we present ebitda  adjusted ebitda and the related financial ratios  as applicable  because we believe that measures such as these provide useful information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and overall operating performance 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are they do not reflect our cash expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  
table of contents they are not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows  they do not reflect the impact on earnings of charges resulting from matters unrelated to our ongoing operations  and other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently from us  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 
because of these limitations  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and the related financial ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 
you should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda and adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
see our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k report 
however  in spite of the above limitations  we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful to an investor in evaluating our results of operations because these measures are widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors  help investors to evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating performance  and are used by our management team for various other purposes in presentations to our board of directors as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting 
we have expanded our operations significantly through the labarge acquisition 
as a result  our operating income included significant charges for amortization in both and  and merger related and change in control compensation expenses in ebitda and adjusted ebitda exclude these charges  as applicable  and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our businesses apart from the amortization  merger related and change in control compensation expenses  as well as interest and tax expenses 
the following financial items have been added back to our net income when calculating ebitda and adjusted ebitda amortization expense may be useful to investors because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of product rights  depreciation may be useful to investors because it generally represents the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations  
table of contents merger related expenses  including change in control compensation  may be useful to investors for determining current cash flow  interest expense may be useful to investors for determining current cash flow  and income tax expense may be useful to investors because it represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred taxes during the period  and may reduce cash flow available for use in our business 
reconciliations of net income loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda and the presentation of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales were as follows in thousands years ended december  net income loss depreciation and amortization interest expense income tax expense benefit ebitda merger related transaction expenses merger related change in control compensation expenses goodwill impairment adjusted ebitda excluding goodwill impairment of net sales includes amortization of intangibles and additional depreciation expense related to the labarge acquisition and prior acquisitions

merger related transaction cost resulting from a change in control provision for certain labarge key executives and employees arising in connection with the labarge acquisition 
adjusted ebitda increased in over primarily due to higher net income including the full year effect of increased revenues and operating expenses  including higher depreciation and amortization expenses  and higher interest expense from the labarge acquisition and a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in fiscal adjusted ebitda increased in compared to primarily due to the partial year effect of increased revenues and operating expenses  including higher depreciation and amortization expenses  and higher interest expense from the labarge acquisition

cost of sales and gross profit gross profit margins vary considerably by contract 
gross profit dollars increased primarily due to the full year impact of the additional gross profit generated from the labarge acquisition 
gross profit margins increased due to a higher proportion of net sales of higher margin product  partially offset by lower margins from engineering services 
gross profit percentages were also lower in due to inventory step up write off related to the labarge acquisition 
gross profit margins for were favorably impacted by an adjustment to correct operating expenses of approximately million  or points  relating to the reversal of certain accrued liabilities that were accrued during the periods from to  that had  in fact  been paid or were not otherwise owed to suppliers 
we assessed the materiality of this reversal and concluded it was immaterial to currently reported annual amounts and previously reported annual and interim amounts and did not restate the prior annual or interim periods

backlog backlog is subject to delivery delays or program cancellations  which are beyond our control 
backlog is affected by timing differences in the placement of customer orders and tends to be concentrated in several programs to a greater extent than our net sales 
backlog in non aerospace and defense markets tends to be of a shorter duration and is generally fulfilled within a month period 
as a result of these factors  trends in our overall level of backlog may not be indicative of trends in our future net sales 
backlog reached record levels of million at december   compared to million at december   as shown in more detail below

we expect to pay down million to million on the term loan in the revolving credit facility matures on june   and the term loan matures on june  interest on the term loan was at december  the revolving credit facility and term loan covenants require ebitda of more than million and a maximum leverage ratio under certain circumstances  as well as annual limitations on capital expenditures and limitations on future disposition of property  investments  acquisitions  repurchase of stock  dividends  and outside indebtedness 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
capital expenditures for were million  well below the maximum allowed under the credit facility of million for the year 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding that would have triggered the leverage ratio covenant 
the leverage ratio covenant becomes increasingly restrictive in future periods and will require us to continue to reduce our debt or increase ebitda

we expect to spend a total of approximately million for capital expenditures in financed by cash generated from operations  approximately the same as  principally to support new contract awards at das and dlt 
as part of our strategic plan to become a tier supplier  additional up front investment in tooling will be required for newer programs which have higher engineering content and higher levels of complexity in assemblies 
we believe the ongoing aerospace and defense subcontractor consolidation makes acquisitions an increasingly important component of our future growth 
we will continue to make prudent acquisitions and capital expenditures for manufacturing equipment and facilities to support long term contracts for commercial and military aircraft and defense programs 
in addition  we will continue to invest to grow our non aerospace and defense end use markets 
we continue to depend on operating cash flow and the availability of our revolving credit facility to provide short term liquidity 
cash generated from operations and bank borrowing capacity is expected to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations during the next twelve months

our ultimate liability with respect to groundwater contamination at certain das facilities will depend upon a number of factors  including changes in existing laws and regulations  the design and cost of construction  operation and maintenance activities  and the allocation of liability among potentially responsible parties 
the above table does not include obligations related to these matters

off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and indemnities 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition except as described below  we recognize revenue  including revenue from products sold under long term contracts  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
we have a significant number of contracts for which net sales are accounted for under the percentage of completion method using the units of delivery as the measure of completion 
the percentage of completion method requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to the contract value  the total cost at completion  and measurement of progress toward completion 
these contracts are primarily fixed price contracts that vary widely in terms of size  length of 
table of contents performance period and expected gross profit margins 
we also recognize revenue on the sale of services including prototype products based on the type of contract time and materials  cost plus reimbursement and firm fixed price 
revenue is recognized i on time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with customers  plus the cost of any allowable materials and out of pocket expenses  ii on cost plus reimbursement contracts based on direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of cost  a fixed amount or a performance based award fee  and iii on fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to estimated total costs 
provision for estimated losses on contracts we record provisions for total anticipated losses on contracts considering total estimated costs to complete the contract compared to total anticipated revenues in the period in which such losses are identified 
the provisions for estimated losses on contracts require management to make certain estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to the future revenue under a contract and the future cost to complete the contract 
management s estimate of the future cost to complete a contract may include assumptions as to improvements in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating and material costs 
if any of these or other assumptions and estimates do not materialize in the future  we may be required to record additional provisions for estimated losses on contracts 
goodwill our business acquisitions have resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter for us and between annual tests  if events indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions  negative developments in equity and credit markets  adverse changes in the markets in which we operate  increases in costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows  or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods  among others 
goodwill is allocated at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
we have three reporting units  das  dlt and miltec 
the application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including the identification of the reporting units  and the determination of both the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting units 
the carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit requires significant judgment  including our estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent upon internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth of our businesses  estimation of the useful lives of the assets which will generate the cash flows  determination of our weighted average cost of capital and other factors 
the estimates and assumptions used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit may change from period to period based upon actual operating results  market conditions and our view of the future trends 
the estimates and assumptions used to determine whether impairment exists and determine the amount of such impairment  if any  are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit would change materially if different assumptions and estimates were used 

table of contents goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing a two step method 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using expected future discounted cash flows 
we also use market valuation approaches  considering comparable company revenue and ebitda multiples to corroborate our results 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step requires fair valuation of all the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
this residual fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value to determine impairment 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying value 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test on december  and concluded goodwill was not impaired 
in the annual goodwill impairment test conducted on december   we recorded an impairment charge of million for the dlt reporting unit  driven by a decline in our market value  which has since recovered  and a softening defense market 
as of december   the date of the most recent annual impairment test  the das  dlt  and miltec reporting units had million  million  and million of recorded goodwill  respectively 
as of december   the fair value of the das  dlt and miltec reporting units exceeded their carrying values by  and respectively 
key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the das reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method included a discount rate of  projected average revenue growth rates of and terminal value growth rate of 
in determining the appropriate discount rate  we considered the weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit which  among other factors  considers the cost of common equity capital and the marginal cost of debt of market participants 
other intangible assets we amortize purchased other intangible assets with finite lives over the estimated economic lives of the assets  ranging from one to eighteen years generally using the straight line method 
the value of other intangibles acquired through business combinations has been estimated using present value techniques which involve estimates of future cash flows 
actual results could vary  potentially resulting in impairment charges 
we review our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter for us or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible asset may not be recoverable 
we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  cost factors  financial performance  adverse legal or regulatory developments  industry and market conditions and general economic conditions 
if the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  we would recognize an impairment loss in the amount of such excess 
we conducted our annual impairment test on december  and determined the indefinite lived intangible asset was not impaired 
accounting for stock based compensation we use a black scholes valuation model in determining the stock based compensation expense for options  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we have one award population with an option vesting term of four years 
we estimated the forfeiture rate based on our historic experience 
the black scholes valuation model requires assumptions and judgments regarding stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  expected options terms  and options that are expected to be forfeited 
management s estimates could differ from actual results 
for performance and restricted stock units  we calculate compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service performance period of the awards 
the performance stock units vest based on a three year cumulative performance cycle 
the restricted stock units  vest over various periods of time ranging from one to three years 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historic experience 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs and is based on net realizable value for other inventory classifications 
inventoried costs include raw materials  outside processing  direct labor and allocated overhead  adjusted for any abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage incurred 
costs under long term contracts are accumulated into  and removed from  inventory on the same basis as other contracts 
we assess the inventory carrying value and reduce it  if necessary  to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand  and internal demand forecasts using management s best estimates given information currently available 
our customer demand can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond our control 
we maintain an allowance for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that are carried at costs that are higher than their estimated net realizable values
