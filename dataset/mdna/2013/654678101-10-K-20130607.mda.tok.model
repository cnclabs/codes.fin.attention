item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this document reflect the consolidated assets  liabilities and operations of niska gas storage partners llc niska partners or niska as at march  and  and for of the years ended march   and the following discussion of the historical consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and accompanying notes of niska included elsewhere in this document 
in addition  this discussion includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may result in actual results differing from statements we make

factors that could cause actual results to differ include those risks and uncertainties that are discussed in risk factors 
overview we operate the countess and suffield gas storage facilities collectively  the aeco hub tm in alberta  canada  and the wild goose and salt plains gas storage facilities in california and oklahoma  respectively 
we market our working gas storage capacity and we optimize our storage capacity with our own proprietary gas purchases at each of these facilities 
we earn revenues by i leasing storage capacity on a long and short term basis for which we receive fees and ii engaging in optimization  where we purchase and sell gas on an economically hedged basis in order to improve facility utilization at margins higher than those that we receive from third party contracts 
the company has a total of bcf of working gas capacity among its facilities  including bcf leased from a third party pipeline company 
we also operate a natural gas marketing business which is an extension of our proprietary optimization activities in canada 
during the year ended march   we experienced a substantial decline in realized revenues  particularly in our short term contracting and optimization activities  compared to amounts realized in fiscal the revenue decline resulted from a significant decline in natural gas price volatility and a significant narrowing of the difference between winter and summer prices in the natural gas futures market  sometimes referred to as the seasonal spread 
these conditions resulted from a number of factors including  but not limited to  i warmer weather patterns across much of north america  ii an increase in the supply of non conventional natural gas including shale gas  iii real or perceived changes in overall supply and demand fundamentals  iv increased development in the number and size of natural gas storage facilities  and v the development of new pipeline infrastructure 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and into the first quarter of fiscal  these conditions improved somewhat as the seasonal spread widened and modestly higher volatility returned to the natural gas futures market 
however  as fiscal progressed the seasonal spread again narrowed in response to warmer weather in north america during the summer of calendar  significant coal to gas switching in response to low natural gas prices and general improvement in north american economic conditions 
we are not able to predict the long term impact of these factors on our revenues and profitability or the amount or timing of potentially positive developments such as increased demand for natural gas resulting from further long term switching from coal to natural gas by utilities  continued increases in industrial or consumer demand or exports of liquefied natural gas lng from north america to other continents 
as we enter fiscal  market conditions  including the seasonal spread and natural gas futures price volatility remain uncertain but are reduced compared to our first fiscal quarter of the prior year

table of contents non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda we use the non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda in this report 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net earnings  its most directly comparable financial measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  is shown above 
we define adjusted ebitda as net earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment of goodwill  unrealized risk management gains and losses  loss on extinguishment of debt  foreign exchange gains and losses  inventory impairment write downs  gains and losses on asset dispositions  asset impairments and other income 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as commercial banks and ratings agencies  to assess the financial performance of our assets  operations and return on capital without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and make distributions to our equity holders  repeatable operating performance that is not distorted by non recurring items or market volatility  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net earnings 
the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings 
adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net earnings and is defined differently by different companies  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
we recognize that the usefulness of adjusted ebitda as an evaluative tool may have certain limitations  including adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and impacts our ability to generate profits and cash flows 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense may have material limitations  adjusted ebitda does not include depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense may have material limitations  adjusted ebitda does not include provision for income taxes 
because the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our costs  any measure that excludes income tax expense may have material limitations  adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital needs  and 
table of contents adjusted ebitda does not allow us to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non recurring items that materially affect our net earnings or loss 
how we evaluate our operations we generate substantially all of our revenue through long and short term contracts for the storage of natural gas for third party customers and the proprietary optimization of storage capacity that is uncontracted  underutilized or available only on a short term basis 
we evaluate our business on the basis of the following key measures volume and fees derived from fee based contracts  volume and margin derived from our proprietary optimization activities  operating  general and administrative expenses  adjusted ebitda  capitalization and leverage  and borrowing base revolver availability  liquidity  and compliance with debt covenants 
volume and fees derived from fee based contracts we provide fee based natural gas storage services to our customers under long term firm ltf and short term firm stf contracts 
when a customer enters into a ltf contract  the customer is obligated to pay us monthly reservation fees for a fixed amount of storage which is usable by the customer at their option subject to contractual limits 
these fees are fixed regardless of the actual use by the customer  but we also collect a variable fee when the services are actually used in order to allow us to recover our variable operating costs 
the volume weighted average life of our ltf contracts at march  was years 
reservation fees comprise over of the revenue generated under ltf contracts and provide a baseline of revenue in excess of our operating and general and administrative costs 
we also provide fee based services under short term firm stf contracts  where a customer pays a fixed fee to inject a specified quantity of gas on a specified date or dates and to store that gas in our storage facilities until withdrawal on a specified future date or dates 
because stf contracts set forth specified future injection or withdrawal dates  we can enter into offsetting transactions to capture incremental value as spot and future natural gas prices fluctuate prior to that activity date 
we monitor both the volume and price of our ltf and stf contracts in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts as well as the relative attractiveness of each of these types of contracts compared to each other as well as in comparison to our optimization strategy 
during periods when market values for storage capacity are higher  we typically use more of our capacity under ltf contracts 
the fees we are able to generate from our stf contracts reflect market conditions  including interest rates 
the capacity used for stf contracts depends  among other things  on available capacity not reserved under ltf contracts as well as market demand and contract rates available for these services 
volume and margin derived from our proprietary optimization activities when market conditions warrant  we enter into economically hedged transactions with available capacity to achieve margins higher than can be obtained from third party contracts 
because we economically hedge our transactions  we are able to determine in advance the minimum margins that will be realized and add incremental margins by re hedging as market conditions change 

table of contents at times  if spreads move favorably  such as if winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer  we can further increase margins that have been substantially locked in by choosing to hold inventory into a subsequent period and re hedging the transaction 
this has the result of increasing our cash flow margins and overall profitability  although for accounting purposes the income is deferred into a later period  causing the appearance of cyclicality in our reported revenues and profits 
when evaluating the performance of our optimization business  we focus on our realized optimization margins  excluding the impact of unrealized hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs 
for accounting purposes  our net realized optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs  which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period 
however  because substantially all inventory is economically hedged  any inventory write downs are offset by hedging gains and any unrealized hedging losses are offset by gains when the inventory is sold 
operating expenses our most significant variable operating expenses are fuel and electricity costs 
these operating expenses vary significantly based upon the amount of natural gas we inject or withdraw throughout the year and the price of the energy commodity at the time of purchase 
variable operating expenses are partially offset by the variable fees we collect from our ltf contracts 
the fixed component of our operating expenses include salaries and labor  parts and supplies  surface and mineral lease rentals and other general operating costs 
these fixed operating expenses are more stable from year to year but can fluctuate due to unforeseen repairs  equipment malfunctions and overhauls of compressors or engines 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation  legal  accounting and tax fees and our office lease 
capitalization  leverage and liquidity we regularly monitor our credit metrics 
our most important credit metric is our fixed charge coverage ratio  or fccr  which is contained in the indenture to our senior notes and our million revolving credit agreement 
the fccr measures our adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges  both of which are defined in the indenture and credit agreement 
as discussed below  when our fccr is below times  we are restricted in our ability to issue new debt 
when our fccr is below times  we are restricted in our ability to pay distributions 
we also monitor our ratio of long term and total debt to adjusted ebitda and our ratio of debt to debt plus equity 
while these metrics are not included in our indenture or credit agreement  they are common metrics used to measure the credit worthiness of companies  including those similar to us 
as of march   we had a fccr of to  a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda of times  a ratio of long term debt to adjusted ebitda of times and a ratio of long term debt to long term debt plus equity of 
when the benefits of inventory write downs are removed from adjusted ebitda  fccr would have been to  the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda would have been times and the ratio of long term debt to adjusted ebitda would have been times 
these amounts compare to an fccr of to  a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda of times times using long term debt only and a ratio of long term debt to long term debt plus equity 
in fiscal and we undertook a number of steps to improve these credit metrics  including the monetization of excess working capital  principally proprietary inventory  the repurchase in fiscal of a portion of our outstanding senior notes and  in fiscal  the amendment and 
table of contents extension of our million revolving credit agreement which provided for lower interest rates under this credit facility 
funding the purchase of proprietary optimization inventory can consume a significant portion of our available working capital 
in times of higher natural gas prices  holding large inventories of proprietary gas may cause us to consume a substantial portion of our available capacity under our credit facility 
accordingly  we closely monitor the utilization and remaining available capacity under our credit facilities and actively pursue additional stf contracts when we determine it is appropriate to maintain liquidity 
factors that impact our business factors that impact the performance of specific components of our business from period to period include the following market price for fee based contracts the price available in the marketplace when negotiating new or replacement contracts reflects demand and affects the amount of storage capacity utilized for fee based contracts that year 
we may increase the capacity that we use for fee based contracts at times of higher market prices and demand 
lower market prices for fee based contracts may result from lower seasonal spreads or a more competitive environment for storage services 
gas storage capacity growth capacity added in the prior year or added during a year is expected to generate incremental revenue 
carried inventory when winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer  we may defer the withdrawal of proprietary optimization inventory until the next fiscal year in order to add incremental margin and economic value 
this results in the deferral of realized earnings and cash flow from one fiscal year to the next 
in some cases  we can mitigate the impact of deferred earnings and cash flow by entering into stf contracts that straddle the two fiscal years 
variable costs the variable operating costs of our facilities mostly comprised of costs associated with fuel or electricity for compressor operations are affected by the amount and price of energy used to inject and withdraw natural gas from our facilities and by the number and timing of gas injections and withdrawals 
for example  if we experience large injections of natural gas in the early summer instead of a steady rate of injections throughout the summer  we would have greater than expected costs in our first quarter and lower than expected costs in our second quarter 
a mild winter could lead to less withdrawals in total  and therefore lower overall variable costs 
these cost variances would be partially offset by similar variances in contract revenues 
carrying costs our cost of capital and the amount of our available working capital impacts the amount of capacity utilized for proprietary optimization as compared to stf contracts 
a higher cost of capital relative to that of our customers or less availability will generally lead to lower volume used for proprietary optimization transactions 
in general  higher carrying costs for us or our customers result in lower margins for us 

table of contents customer usage patterns incremental revenue opportunities in the form of stf or proprietary optimization transactions may arise for us if capacity usage by our ltf customers is underutilized or offset by other ltf customers 
weather weather extremes and variability directly affect our margins 
very mild years tend to reduce revenue generated under our stf and proprietary optimization strategies  while years with very hot summers  very cold winters or a number of significant storms tend to increase the revenue generated under those strategies 
supply patterns for natural gas during the past several years north america has experienced a dramatic increase in the supply of natural gas  principally from the development of unconventional natural gas sources  including shale gas 
these increases in supply have been coupled with build outs of natural gas pipeline capacity in certain areas of the united states  which generally have the effect of increasing deliverability of natural gas to more north american markets and dampening the price differentials for natural gas between geographic markets  including those served by us 
we believe that these factors tend to reduce the absolute price of natural gas along with the associated seasonal spread as well as dampen natural gas price volatility 
we are unable to determine or predict the direct impact on our business from these developments 
inflation inflation has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended march   and although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it remains a factor in the current economy 
segment information our process for the identification of reportable segments involves examining the nature of services offered  the types of customer contracts entered into and the nature of the economic and regulatory environment 
since our inception  we have operated along functional lines in our commercial  engineering and operations teams for operations in alberta  northern california and the us midcontinent 
all functional lines and facilities offer the same services fee based revenue and optimization 
the company has a small marketing business which is an extension of the company proprietary optimization activities 
proprietary optimization activities occur when the company purchases  stores and sells natural gas for its own account in order to utilize or optimize storage capacity that is not contracted or available to third party customers 
all services are delivered using reservoir storage 
we measure profitability consistently along all functional lines based on revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and unrealized risk management gains and losses 
we have aggregated our functional lines and facilities into one reportable segment as at and for the fiscal years ended march   and information pertaining to our fee based and proprietary optimization revenues is presented in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings and comprehensive income 
all facilities have the same types of customers major companies in the energy industry  industrial  commercial  and local distribution companies and municipal energy consumers 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenue 
revenues include fee based revenue and optimization  net 
fee based revenue consists of long term contracts for storage fees that are generated when we lease storage capacity on a monthly basis and short term fees associated with specified injections and withdrawals of natural gas 
optimization revenue results from the purchase of natural gas inventory and its forward sale to future periods through financial and physical energy trading contracts  with our facilities being used to store the inventory between acquisition and disposition of the natural gas inventory 
details of our revenue include year ended march  in thousands long term contract revenue short term contract revenue total fee based revenue realized optimization  net unrealized risk management losses gains write down of inventory total optimization revenue total revenue the change in revenue was primarily attributable to the following ltf revenues 
fiscal ltf revenues declined by million from fiscal the decrease in revenues resulted from lower average rates for ltf contracts in fiscal compared to fiscal these lower contract rates were partially offset by additional storage capacity which we allocated to our ltf strategy in the current fiscal year 
during fiscal  the absolute amount of capacity utilized for ltf contracts increased by bcf 
in addition  fuel and commodity fee revenue decreased by million as a result of lower volumes of gas cycled in the current year 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the canadian and us dollar decreased revenues by million compared to last year 
stf revenues 
stf revenues increased by million compared to fiscal higher stf revenues resulted from more capacity being utilized for this strategy compared to the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  we had significant cash on hand  which enhanced the overall benefits associated with our optimization activities compared to stf strategies 
accordingly  a larger portion of our capacity bcf was utilized for stf in fiscal compared to fiscal bcf 
realized margins were per mcf in fiscal compared to per mcf in fiscal optimization revenues 
total optimization revenues  including realized and unrealized gains and losses  along with write downs of proprietary optimization inventories  decreased to a loss of million from net revenue of million in fiscal when evaluating the performance of our optimization business  we focus on our realized optimization margins  excluding the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs 
for financial reporting purposes  our net optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs  which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period 
however  because all inventory is economically hedged  any inventory write downs are offset by hedging gains and any unrealized 
table of contents hedging losses are offset by realized gains from the sale of physical inventory 
the components of optimization revenues are as follows realized optimization revenues 
realized optimization revenues include million of benefits of inventory write downs related to inventory impairments recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal excluding these benefits  realized optimization revenues declined by  or million 
this reduction resulted from a decrease in capacity allocated to optimization strategies of in fiscal compared to the prior year 
realized optimization revenues include revenues from our natural gas marketing operations of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
unrealized risk management gains losses 
unrealized risk management gains in fiscal were due to increases in the value of financial hedges resulting from decreases in forward sales prices of natural gas relative to our contracts and their positioning near the end of the fourth quarter 
unrealized risk management losses in fiscal resulted from the realization of hedges in the current period and the opposite situation occurring in the current year where natural gas prices increased relative to our contract prices 
as all inventory is economically hedged  any risk management gains or losses are offset by future losses or gains associated with the sale of proprietary inventory 
unrealized risk management gains losses include unrealized gains of million in fiscal and million of unrealized loss in fiscal related to our natural gas marketing operations 
write down of inventory 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  near term prices of natural gas fell dramatically 
this period of depressed near term natural gas prices continued until the first quarter of fiscal this reduction increased the value of our economic hedges and decreased the value of the proprietary optimization inventory underlying those hedges 
concurrently  the steepening of the forward curve at that time encouraged us to realize incremental revenues through the repositioning of inventory deliveries from the first quarter of into future periods in fiscal or beyond 
with the realization of hedges positioned in the first quarter of fiscal and positioning of new hedges  at lower values  in future periods  the market value of our inventories became less than the carrying cost 
accordingly  we wrote down our proprietary inventories by million in the first quarter of fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal loss before income taxes 
loss before income taxes for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to a loss before income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to the impairment of goodwill in fiscal and decreased revenue discussed above  plus the following operating expenses 
operating expenses consisted of the following year ended march  in thousands general operating costs  including insurance  vehicle leases  safety and training costs salaries and benefits fuel and electricity maintenance total operating expenses 
table of contents operating expenses in fiscal decreased by million compared to the prior year 
we ended the previous fiscal year with high levels of inventory which reduced cycled volumes at all of our facilities in the current period 
this reduced cycling resulted in a decrease in fuel and electricity costs of million  in addition to lower costs for parts  supplies and labor as well as chemicals used in the withdrawal process million in aggregate 
lease costs in fiscal were reduced by million as a result of the cancellation of a third party storage contract as well as the renegotiation of terms of a lease for certain facility equipment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consisted of the following year ended march  in thousands compensation costs general costs  including office and it costs legal  audit and regulatory costs total general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of increased incentive compensation accruals 
loss on impairment and sale of assets 
in fiscal  we sold approximately bcf of cushion gas  which is treated as a component of property  plant and equipment in our financial statements  and recognized a loss of million representing the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the cushion gas 
loss on debt retirement 
we amended and restated our million credit agreement in june the write off of a portion of associated deferred financing costs resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of million 
interest expense 
the repurchase of senior notes with a face value of million between august and february reduced interest costs by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was partially offset by higher interest costs incurred due to increased use of our million revolving credit facility to finance proprietary inventory purchases 
our average outstanding balance drawn on the credit facility was million during the year ended march   compared to million during the year ended march  however  this increase in average balances was partially offset by improved interest rates under the new credit facility 
income tax expense benefit 
the income tax benefit in the current year is primarily due to the tax planning strategies undertaken in certain taxable canadian entities  the recognition of losses in those entities  and the recognition of income in certain non taxable entities 
net loss 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the change in net loss was primarily attributable to the movement in unrealized risk management gains losses in fiscal  a goodwill impairment charge of million in fiscal and other factors discussed above 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the change in revenue was primarily attributable to the following ltf revenues 
fiscal ltf revenues declined by million from fiscal the decrease in revenues resulted from lower variable cycling fee revenue in as the warm 
table of contents winter storage season reduced overall demand for natural gas and resulted in substantially fewer withdrawals compared to fiscal during fiscal  the absolute amount of capacity utilized for ltf contracts increased by bcf 
however  ltf contracts which expired in fiscal were replaced by new contracts at lower rates 
overall rates  including variable demand charges  were per mcf in compared to per mcf in fiscal stf revenues 
stf revenues declined by million compared to fiscal the decline resulted from less capacity being utilized for this strategy 
as fiscal commenced  we had significant cash on hand  which enhanced the overall benefits associated with our optimization activities compared to stf 
accordingly  a smaller portion of our capacity bcf was utilized for stf in fiscal compared to fiscal bcf 
realized margins were per mcf in fiscal compared to per mcf in fiscal optimization revenues 
total optimization revenues  including realized and unrealized gains and losses  along with write downs of proprietary optimization inventories  increased by million from fiscal the components of optimization revenues are as follows realized optimization revenues 
the decrease in realized optimization revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower margins realized from the optimization strategy 
the average realized margin decreased by to per mcf from per mcf 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase in capacity that was utilized for proprietary optimization activities due to the significant amount of working capital that was available to us  and further aided by lower commodity prices that existed during fiscal march  compared to fiscal capacity utilized for optimization activities increased by from bcf for the fiscal year ended march  to bcf for the fiscal year ended march  realized optimization revenues for the years ended march  and include revenues from our marketing business of million and million  respectively 
unrealized risk management gains 
unrealized gains are attributable to natural gas prices falling after financial hedges were transacted for the fiscal year ended march  and rising after financial hedges were transacted for the fiscal year ended march  as all inventory is economically hedged  any risk management gains or losses are offset by future gains or losses associated with the sale of proprietary inventory 
unrealized risk management gains losses include gains or losses from our marketing business of million of unrealized losses in fiscal and million of unrealized gains in fiscal write down of inventory 
as noted above  we wrote down our proprietary inventory by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal no inventory write downs were required in fiscal loss before income taxes 
loss before income taxes for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to earnings before income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in earnings before income taxes was primarily attributable to the decreased revenue discussed above  plus the following operating expenses 
operating expenses of million in fiscal were essentially flat with million in operating expenses incurred in the prior year 
fuel and electricity costs were slightly higher  as electricity price spikes at our countess facility were offset by generally lower cycling of natural gas at all of our facilities as a result of reduced demand for natural gas 
in addition  natural gas prices were lower at our facilities that use natural gas as compressor fuel 
general and administrative expenses 
these expenses decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to reduced incentive compensation accruals as a 
table of contents result of lower earnings 
legal  audit and regulatory costs increased by million as a result of higher professional fees in the current year 
loss on impairment and sale of assets 
in fiscal we sold approximately bcf of cushion gas  which is treated as a component of property  plant and equipment in our financial statements  and recognized a loss of million representing the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the cushion gas 
in addition  we wrote down certain pipe inventory at a development project by million 
loss on debt retirement 
we repurchased million principal amount of our senior notes in fiscal the difference between the aggregate purchase price and principal amount of the notes million coupled with the write off of a portion of the deferred financing costs associated with the senior notes million resulted in a loss on debt retirement of million 
impairment of goodwill 
during fiscal  we determined that the significant reduction in natural gas price volatility and the continued narrow seasonal spread were goodwill impairment indicators 
we made this determination because these factors had a material negative effect on our financial performance in fiscal and our expected performance in future years 
accordingly  we performed a goodwill impairment test and as a result recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
interest expense 
the repurchase of million in senior notes reduced interest costs by million during the year ended march  compared to the prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by higher interest costs incurred due to increased use of our million revolving credit facility to finance proprietary inventory purchases 
our average outstanding balance drawn on the credit facility was million during the year ended march   compared to million during the year ended march  income tax expense benefit 
the income tax benefit in the current year is primarily due to the tax planning strategies undertaken in certain taxable canadian entities  the recognition of losses in those entities  and the recognition of income in certain non taxable entities 
the goodwill discussed above is not a deductible expense for tax purposes and therefore does not impact taxable income 
net loss 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to net earnings of million for the fiscal year ended march  the change in net loss earnings was primarily attributable to the impairment of goodwill and other factors discussed above 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is highly seasonal 
in general  revenue is expected to be highest during our third and fourth fiscal quarters october through march  during the peak of the natural gas storage winter withdrawal season  when we typically sell most of our optimization inventory to serve the seasonal demand created by the north american residential market which uses natural gas to heat their homes 
revenue is typically lower in the natural gas storage summer months april through october  when natural gas prices are generally lower and we shift to the storage injection season and replenish our natural gas inventory 
because we purchase natural gas and build inventories in the summer months and hedge sales forward into the winter months  the peak borrowing on our revolving credit facilities are generally highest in the middle of our third fiscal quarter  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in our fourth fiscal quarter 
however  in both fiscal and  realized optimization revenues resulted in losses in the fiscal third quarter 
in fiscal  these losses resulted from the 
table of contents timing of optimization strategies which resulted in earlier recognition of optimization gains in the first and second quarters compared to the third quarter 
in fiscal  these losses resulted from the company determination to reduce working capital through the sale of excess optimization inventories  which resulted in realized losses in the third quarter  with the offsetting gains recognized in the fourth quarter 
the following table illustrates the differences in the recognition of revenue associated with our revenue strategies 
year ended march  qtr qtr qtr qtr total in thousands fee based revenue ltf revenue stf revenue realized optimization realized optimization  net total realized revenue realized revenue as a percentage of total realized revenue year ended march  qtr qtr qtr qtr total in thousands fee based revenue ltf revenue stf revenue realized optimization realized optimization  net total realized revenue realized revenue as a percentage of total realized revenue liquidity and capital resources as noted above  during fiscal and continuing into fiscal  our revenues and profitability were negatively impacted by a combination of factors that resulted in reduced revenue margins compared to prior periods 
we have responded with a number of actions designed to reduce debt and interest costs and to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility under these conditions 
these actions included the monetization of approximately million of excess working capital  principally proprietary inventory  the repurchase in fiscal of approximately million principal amount of our senior notes  the amendment and extension in fiscal of our million revolving credit facility which extended the term of that facility from march to june and which reduced 
table of contents interest costs through an improved pricing grid and the elimination of an interest rate floor for libor based borrowings  and an equity restructuring completed effective april  which eliminated our subordinated units and  among other things  enhanced our potential access to equity capital markets  if required 
we believe that these actions have strengthened our financial position  improved our liquidity and enhanced our ability to attract capital 
our primary short term liquidity needs are to make interest and principal payments under our million credit agreement  and our senior notes  to fund our operating expenses and maintenance capital  to pay for the acquisition of proprietary optimization inventory along with associated margin requirements and to pay quarterly distributions  to the extent declared by our board of directors 
we fund these expenditures through a combination of cash on hand  cash from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement 
our medium to long term liquidity needs primarily relate to potential additional debt repurchases or refinancing  organic growth opportunities and  potentially  asset acquisitions 
we expect to finance the cost of any significant expansion projects or acquisitions from borrowings under our existing or possible future credit facilities or a mix of borrowings and additional equity offerings as well as cash on hand and cash from operations 
as of march   we have announced that we are evaluating a development project called starks in southwest louisiana as a hydrocarbon liquids storage facility 
because this project remains in the evaluation phase  the amount and timing of any capital requirements are uncertain 
other than starks  as of march   we do not anticipate any expansion projects or acquisitions that would require additional debt or equity financing 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of the principal amount of our senior notes  reducing the outstanding balance to million at march  from million at march  these purchases were funded primarily from working capital  including approximately million of proprietary optimization inventory 
in addition  in fiscal we sold approximately bcf of cushion gas at one of our facilities for proceeds of approximately million and the carlyle riverstone funds reinvested million of distributions that had been paid to them in additional common units 
we did not purchase any additional senior notes in fiscal because market conditions provided incentives to carry our remaining proprietary inventory forward to future periods and  accordingly  such inventories were not liquidated until the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  in fiscal we sold another approximately bcf of cushion gas at two of our facilities for proceeds of approximately million 
together  these sales allowed us to reduce our outstanding balances under our credit facility from million at march  to million at march  and  upon collection of the proceeds from the liquidation of proprietary optimization inventories subsequent to march   to eliminate outstanding balances altogether 
we expect to begin borrowings under the credit facility to resume during the summer of as we begin purchases of proprietary optimization inventories 
however  we do not expect inventory balances in fiscal to approach levels carried during fiscal we believe that our existing sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs through the year ending march  funding of material organic growth projects or acquisitions as well as other longer term liquidity needs will depend on the availability and cost of capital in the debt and equity markets  as well as compliance with our debt covenants 
accordingly  the availability of any potential funding on economic terms is uncertain 
our principal debt covenant is our fixed charge coverage ratio  or fccr  which is included in both our credit facility agreement and the indenture to our senior notes 
when our fccr  which is calculated quarterly on a trailing twelve months basis by dividing adjusted ebitda defined 
table of contents substantially the same as presented herein by fixed charges  which are measured as interest expense plus the amount of interest capitalized  but giving pro forma credit for all of the previous twelve months for certain debt purchases and acquisitions  is less than to  we are restricted in our ability to issue new debt 
however  this restriction does not affect our ability to access our existing credit facility or to amend  extend or replace that facility 
when our fccr is below to  we are restricted in our ability to pay distributions 
at march   our fccr was to if our fccr were to be below to  we would be permitted thereafter to pay million of distributions 
this million amount is cumulative for all periods that our fccr is below to the appropriateness and amount of distributions are determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
because we intend to distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders  our growth may not be as fast as the growth of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations 
moreover  because of constraints in the capital markets or our inability to find and develop organic growth opportunities or potential acquisitions  our future growth may be slower than our historical growth 
we expect that we will  in large part  rely on external financing sources  including bank borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities  to fund significant expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions 
to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally  our cash distribution policy could significantly impair our ability to grow 
to the extent that we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures  the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level  which in turn may affect the available cash that we have available to distribute to each unit 
our operating agreement does not limit our ability to issue additional units  including units ranking senior to the common units 
the incurrence of additional debt by us or our operating subsidiaries would result in increased interest expense  which in turn may also affect the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders 
historical cash flows our cash flows are significantly influenced by our level of natural gas inventory  margin deposits and related forward sale contracts or hedging positions at the end of each accounting period and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  our period to period cash flows are heavily influenced by the seasonality of our proprietary optimization activities 
for example  we generally purchase significant quantities of natural gas during the summer months and sell natural gas during the winter months 
the storage of natural gas for our own account can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities for the period we pay for and store the natural gas and the subsequent period in which we receive proceeds from the sale of natural gas 
when we purchase and store natural gas for our own account  we use cash to pay for the natural gas and record the gas as inventory and thereby reduce our cash flows from operating activities 
we typically borrow on our revolving credit facilities to fund these purchases  and these borrowings increase our cash flows from financing activities 
conversely  when we collect the proceeds from the sale of natural gas that we purchased and stored for our own account  the impact on our cash flows from operating activities is positive and the impact on our cash flows from financing activities is negative 
therefore  our cash flows from operating activities fluctuate significantly from period to period as we purchase natural gas  store it  and then sell it in a later period 
in addition  we have margin requirements on our economically hedged positions 
as the cash deposits we make to satisfy our margin requirements increase and decrease with our volume of derivative positions and changes in commodity prices  our cash flows from operating 
table of contents activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the fiscal years ended march    and year ended march  in thousands operating activities net loss earnings adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities unrealized foreign exchange gains loss deferred income tax benefit unrealized risk management losses gains depreciation and amortization deferred charges amortization loss on extinguishment of debt loss on impairment and sale of assets impairment of goodwill write down of inventory changes in non cash working capital net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities other information proprietary inventory at cost at year end operating activities 
the variability in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to varying market conditions that exist during any given fiscal period  which impacts the margins and fees under each of our fee based and optimization activities  and market conditions at the end of any given fiscal period  which impacts our decision to sell significant volumes of inventory or hold them over a fiscal period end and sell them in the next fiscal period if there is the economic incentive to do so  such as to increase the margins from previous optimization transactions 
cash provided by operating activities resulted from the liquidation of inventories carried over from the previous year  along with the settlement of associated hedges 
these funds were used to repay drawings on our revolver and complete the expansion of our wild goose facility 
year ended march  in thousands changes in non cash working capital margin deposits natural gas inventory prepaid expenses accrued receivables deferred revenue accrued liabilities other net changes in non cash working capital 
table of contents working capital 
working capital is defined as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
our working capital ratio is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities 
our working capital is affected by the relationship between unrealized financial risk management hedges which are marked to market on a monthly basis  the margin deposits required by our brokers for such gains and losses  proprietary inventory which is stored in our facilities and cash used to fund inventory purchases 
our working capital levels are also affected by our capital spending for maintenance and expansion activity 
as of march   we had net working capital of million working capital ratio of to  which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities  representing a significant change compared to net working capital of million working capital ratio of to at march  the most significant reason for this reduction of million is the use of working capital to pay for the completion of our wild goose expansion 
investing activities 
most of the investing activities in each of the fiscal years ended march   and were attributed to expansion capital expenditures at our storage facilities 
these expenditures  as outlined in capital expenditures  have enabled us to increase our effective working gas capacity by bcf during the three year period 
however  maintenance capital expenditures have been consistently modest  ranging between million and million each year during this same period 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities consists of debt incurred for the acquisition of assets  periodic optional and mandatory retirements of such debt  advances and repayments made on our previous credit facilities to fund proprietary inventory purchases  contributions of capital from our equity holders to fund expansion capital expenditures and debt retirements and distributions made to our equity holders 
during the fiscal year ended march  there was an million net reduction in borrowings on our credit facilities with funding primarily derived from net proprietary inventory sales 
during the fiscal year ended march  there was a million net increase in credit facility borrowings with the proceeds primarily used for net proprietary inventory purchases 
during the same fiscal year  we completed the issuance and sale of  common units at a price of per unit to sponsor holdings 
total proceeds of million were used to reduce amounts owing under the senior notes 
in aggregate  we repurchased million of the principal amount of our senior notes during the fiscal period 
during the fiscal year ended march  we received proceeds of million from our ipo in may of  after deducting fees of million 
this was offset by distributions totaling million made to the owners of niska predecessor in connection with our debt and equity offerings  and million related to quarterly distributions made to our unitholders during the period 

table of contents capital expenditures our capital expenditures for the years ended march   and were as follows year ended march  in thousands maintenance capital expansion capital total cash expenditures non cash working capital related to property  plant and equipment expenditures non cash transfer of natural gas inventory to property  plant and equipment total maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets  to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives 
expansion capital expenditures are made to acquire additional assets to grow our business  to expand and upgrade our facilities and to acquire similar operations or facilities 
cost reduction expenditures are those capital expenditures which increase the effectiveness and or efficiency of our assets or which enable us to operate at a lower cost 
under our current plan  we expect to continue to spend approximately million to million per year for maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the integrity of our storage facilities and ensure the reliable injection  storage and withdrawal of natural gas for our customers 
in the fiscal year ended march  we spent a total of million to expand the capacity and services of our facilities 
expansion capital expenditures included the addition of bcf capacity at our aeco facility and the completion of injection and withdrawal enhancements as well as an additional pipeline interconnect as part of a bcf capacity increase at our wild goose facility to bcf 
expansion capital for fiscal is expected to be less than million and relates principally to enhancing existing capacity and to developing new projects 
our senior notes due on march   niska us and niska canada  issued  units  each unit consisting of principal amount of senior notes due of niska us and principal amount of senior notes of niska canada 
during the year ended march   we paid million  excluding accrued interest  to repurchase senior notes with a principal amount of million

our million credit agreement concurrently with the issuance of our senior notes  niska partners  through its subsidiaries  niska gas storage us  llc and aeco gas storage partnership entered into senior secured asset based revolving credit facilities  consisting of a us revolving credit facility and a canadian revolving credit facility the credit facilities or the million credit agreement 
on june   niska partners  through the same subsidiaries  completed an amendment and restatement of the million credit agreement 
these credit facilities provide for revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to million for each of the us revolving credit facility and the canadian revolving credit facility 
subject to certain conditions  each of the us revolving credit facility and the canadian revolving credit facility may be expanded up to million in additional commitments  and the commitments in each facility may be reallocated on terms and according to procedures to be determined 
loans under the us revolving facility will be denominated in us dollars and loans under the canadian revolving facility may be denominated  at niska partners option  in either us or canadian dollars 
each revolving credit facility matures on june  million was written off during the year ended march   representing a portion of the deferred financing costs associated with the amendment and restatement of the original agreement 
borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are limited to a borrowing base calculated as the sum of specified percentages of eligible cash equivalents  eligible accounts receivable  the net liquidating value of hedge positions in broker accounts  eligible inventory  issued but unused letters of credit  and certain fixed assets minus the amount of any reserves and other priority claims 
borrowings bear interest at a floating rate  which in the case of us dollar loans can be either libor plus an applicable margin or  at our option  a base rate plus an applicable margin  and in the case of canadian dollar loans can be either the bankers acceptance rate plus an applicable margin or  at our option  a prime rate plus an applicable margin 
the credit agreement provides that we may borrow only up to the lesser of the level of our then current borrowing base and our committed maximum borrowing capacity  which is currently million 
our borrowing base was million as of june  our obligations under our million credit agreement are guaranteed by us and all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions and secured by a lien on substantially all of our and our direct and indirect subsidiaries current and fixed assets subject to certain exceptions

such fixed charge coverage ratio will be tested at the end of each quarter until such time as average excess availability exceeds for thirty consecutive days 
our million credit agreement contains limitations on our ability to pay distributions in respect of  repurchase or pay dividends on our membership interests or other capital stock or make other restricted payments 
these limitations are substantially similar to those contained in the indenture governing our senior notes described above  except that the credit agreement is less restrictive

goodwill impairment during the year ended march   we determined that the significant reduction in natural gas price volatility and the continued narrow seasonal spread were impairment indicators 
we made this determination because these factors had a material negative effect on our current financial performance and our expected performance in future years 
accordingly  we performed an impairment test which resulted in a charge of million related to the goodwill valuation of our aeco hub tm and ngpl reporting units 
we determined the fair value of the aeco hub tm and ngpl reporting units using a combination of the present value of future cash flows method and the comparable transactions method 
the present value of future cash flows was estimated using i discrete financial forecasts  which rely on estimates of revenue  expenses and volumes  ii long term natural gas volatility and seasonal spreads  iii long term average exchange rate between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar and iv appropriate discount rates 
the comparable transactions method analyzed other purchases of similar assets and considered i the anticipated cash flows determined above  ii recent transaction multiples based on 
table of contents anticipated cash flows and iii the similarity of comparable transactions to our facilities 
specifically  we used experience and budgeted amounts to estimate cycling volumes and expenses  future summer to winter spreads reflecting a longer term outlook  and extrinsic values consistent with those achieved in the business to estimate future revenue 
these values used to estimate future revenues were lower than the seasonal storage spread and extrinsic values used in the test performed at march  we also used a comparable transaction multiple consistent with recent transactions for depleted reservoir storage facility acquisitions  which are comparable to our owned facilities 
significant assumptions that we made in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities include the replacement cost  depreciation and obsolescence and useful lives of property  plant and equipment and the present value of incremental cash flows attributable to certain intangible assets 
critical accounting estimates and policies the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the application of gaap  including revenue recognition  the valuation of risk management assets and liabilities  inventory and goodwill 
these estimates affect  among other items  valuing identified intangible assets  evaluating impairments of long lived assets  depreciation of cushion gas  establishing estimated useful lives for long lived assets  estimating revenues and expense accruals  assessing income tax expense and the requirement for a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset and valuing asset retirement obligations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
the term market risks refers to the risk of loss arising from changes in commodity prices  currency exchange rates  interest rates  counterparty credit and liquidity 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
commodity price risk to mitigate exposure to changes in commodity prices  we enter into purchases and sales of natural gas inventory and concurrently match the volumes in these transactions with offsetting forward contracts or other hedging transactions 
derivative contracts used to manage market risk generally consist of the following forwards and futures are contractual agreements to purchase or sell a specific financial instrument or natural gas at a specified price and date in the future 
we enter into forwards and futures to mitigate the impact of natural gas price volatility 
in addition to cash settlement  exchange traded futures may also be settled by physical delivery of natural gas 
swap contracts are agreements between two parties to exchange streams of payments over time according to specified terms 
swap contracts require receipt of payment for the notional quantity 
table of contents of the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date 
we enter into commodity swaps to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas prices 
option contracts are contractual agreements to convey the right  but not the obligation  for the purchaser of the option to buy or sell a specific physical or notional amount of a commodity at a fixed price  either at a fixed date or at any time within a specified period 
we may enter into option agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas prices 
in order to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations  our policy is to promptly enter into a forward sale contract or other hedging transaction for every proprietary purchase contract we enter into 
therefore  inventory purchases are matched with forward sales or are otherwise economically hedged so that there are no speculative positions beyond the minimal operational tolerances specified in our risk policy 
at march   bcf of natural gas inventory was economically hedged  representing of our total current inventory 
however  because inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market  not fair value  if the price of natural gas increased by per mcf the value of that inventory would increase by million  but the fair value or mark to market value of our hedges would decrease by million  due to bcf of that inventory that was not economically hedged 
conversely  if the price of natural gas declined by per mcf  the value of that inventory would decrease by million while the fair value of our hedges would increase by only million  due to the non economically hedged position 
long term inventory and fuel gas used for operating our facilities are not offset 
total volumes of long term inventory and fuel gas at march  were bcf and bcf  respectively bcf and bcf respectively at march  
although the intent of our risk management strategy is to protect our margins and manage our liquidity risk on related margin deposit requirements  we do not qualify any of our derivatives for hedge accounting 
changes in the fair values of these derivatives receive mark to market treatment in current earnings and result in greater potential for earnings volatility 
this accounting treatment is discussed further under note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
currency exchange risk our cash flow relating to our canadian operations is reported in the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
monetary assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
because a portion of our canadian business is conducted in canadian dollars  we use certain financial instruments to minimize the risks of changes in the exchange rate 
these instruments include forward swaps or spot swaps buying or selling us dollars 
options may also be used in the future 
all of the financial instruments utilized are placed with large brokers and financial institutions 
at march   we had forward currency exchange contracts for a notional value of million 
the value of the forward currency contracts was an asset of million at march  and a liability of million at march   and is recorded in derivative assets and derivative liabilities accounts on the consolidated balance sheets 
these contracts expire on various dates between april and august and are for the exchange of million canadian dollars into million us dollars 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk due to variable interest rates under our million credit agreement 
all such borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at different rates 
as of march   we had million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 
the credit facilities currently provide an interest rate on borrowings between and  depending on whether a fixed term or floating rate option is chosen 
in the future  we may borrow under fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that also give rise to interest rate risk 
changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing our funds available for capital investment  operations or distributions to our unitholders 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by would have changed our interest expense by approximately million for the fiscal year ended march  counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer fails to perform its contractual obligations 
we engage in transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial  commercial  residential and municipal energy consumers 
credit risk associated with trade accounts receivable is mitigated by the high percentage of investment grade customers  collateral support of receivables and our ability to take ownership of customer owned natural gas stored in its facilities in the event of non payment 
margin deposits  or letters of credit in lieu of deposits  are required on derivative instruments utilized to manage our counterparty credit risk 
as commodity prices increase or decrease  the fair value of our derivative instruments changes thereby increasing or decreasing our margin deposit requirements 
rising commodity prices or an expectation of rising prices could increase the cash needed to manage our commodity price exposure and thereby increase our liquidity requirements  limit amounts available to us through borrowing and reduce the volume of natural gas we may purchase 
exchange traded futures and options have minimal credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee every contract will be margined on a daily basis 
in the event of any default  our account on the exchange would be absorbed by other clearing members 
because every member posts an initial margin  the exchange can protect the exchange members if or when a clearing member defaults 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due 
our approach to managing liquidity risk is to contract a substantial part of our facilities to generate constant cash flow and to ensure that they always have sufficient cash and credit facilities to meet their obligations when due  under both normal and stressed conditions  without incurring unacceptable losses or damage to reputation 
fair value measurement the fair values of the derivative instruments are based on quoted market prices obtained from nymex or ice and from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the instrument  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at a specified time 
we utilize observable market data when available  or models that utilize observable market data when determining fair value 
risk management policy and practices we have in place risk management practices that are intended to quantify and manage risks facing our business 
these risks include  but are not limited to  market  credit  foreign exchange  operational  
table of contents and liquidity risks 
our hedging practices mitigate our exposure to commodity price and foreign exchange risks 
strict open position limits are enforced  and physical inventory is offset with forward hedges 
our counterparty strategy ensures we have a strong mix of quality customers 
we have models in place to monitor and manage operational and liquidity risks 
the risk management committee  or rmc  is comprised of members of our management team 
the rmc provides oversight of our commercial activities 
the committee reviews the adequacy of controls to ensure compliance with the risk policy 
our rmc meets weekly to review and respond to risks facing our business 
the rmc oversees the analysis of positions and exposures provided by our risk management function  which provides daily and weekly reporting to facilitate understanding of these exposures 
the rmc assesses and manages the potential for loss in our positions through these reports 
if limits are exceeded  the rmc is informed and appropriate action is taken to review and remedy 
the risk management function is independent of the commercial and marketing groups and reports through our chief financial officer 
optimization activities can only be executed by employees authorized to transact under the risk policy 
all commercial personnel are annually required to read and certify that they will adhere to the principles purported within the policy 
each person authorized to make transactions is subject to internal volume limits 
counterparties are subject to credit limits as approved by our credit department 
our commercial and risk functions operate independently to ensure proper segregation of duties 
critical deal information for every transaction is entered into our deal capture systems and confirmed with counterparties 
despite the policies  procedures and controls described above  there can be no assurance that our risk management systems will prevent losses that would negatively affect our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
see risk factors risks inherent in our business our risk management policies cannot eliminate all commodity price risk 
in addition  any non compliance with our risk management policies could result in significant financial losses
