total oil and gas production costs per boe for the year ended december  increased by percent as compared to the increase in production costs per boe during is primarily reflective of increases in lease operating expenses  third party transportation charges and net natural gas plant gathering charges 
lease operating costs increased during primarily due to a per boe increase in salt water disposal costs principally comprised of water hauling fees 
the per boe increase in third party transportation charges during is primarily due to gathering  treating and transportation costs associated with increasing sales volumes from the company successful drilling program in the eagle ford shale field 
net natural gas plant charges increased by per boe during  primarily due to a reduction in third party revenues from processing third party gas volumes in company owned facilities as a result of lower gas and ngl prices being realized on the volumes retained as a processing fee 
during  total production costs per boe increased by six percent as compared to the increase in production costs per boe is primarily due to i increased third party transportation and processing charges associated with increasing eagle ford shale production  ii repairs associated with severe winter weather disruptions encountered during the first quarter of and iii inflation in well servicing costs  partially offset by reductions in vpp delivery commitments and decreased workover costs

depletion expense on oil and gas properties  the largest component of dd a expense  was  and per boe during  and  respectively 
during  the eight percent increase in per boe depletion expense was primarily due to i increased drilling expenditures on proved undeveloped locations  primarily in the spraberry field and ii declines in proved gas reserves due to lower first day of the month gas prices during the month period ending on december   partially offset by iii the impairment effects of reducing carrying values of the barnett shale field and the south texas edwards trend austin chalk fields during and  respectively see the discussion below for more information on the company impairment charges 
during  the one percent increase in per boe depletion expense was primarily due to modest inflation in drilling costs in the spraberry field in west texas and the barnett shale field  partially offset by the cost containment associated with employed integrated services and increasing production in the eagle ford shale play where portions of the company drilling costs were carried by a third party 
impairment of oil and gas properties and other long lived assets 
the company performs assessments of its long lived assets to be held and used  including oil and gas properties  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
management commodity price outlooks represent longer term outlooks that are developed based on observable third party futures price outlooks as of a measurement date management price outlooks 
during and  declines in management price outlooks provided indications of possible impairment of the company predominantly dry gas properties in the edwards trend and austin chalk fields in south texas  the barnett shale field in north texas and the raton field in southeastern colorado 
as a result of management assessments  during and  the company recognized pretax noncash impairment charges of million and million to reduce the carrying values of the barnett shale field and the south texas edwards trend austin chalk fields  respectively  to their estimated fair values 
the company estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to the raton field oil and gas properties indicated on december  that its carrying amounts are expected to be recovered  but continues to be at risk for impairment if estimates of future cash flows decline 
for example  the company estimates that the carrying value of the raton field may become partially impaired if the average gas price in management price outlooks  of per mcf as of december   were to decline by approximately to per mcf 
the company raton field is a relatively long lived asset that had a carrying value of billion as of december  if the raton field were to become impaired in a future period  the company would recognize noncash  pretax impairment charges in that period that could range from billion to billion 
it is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to these or other properties may change in the future resulting in the need to impair their carrying values 
the primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows are i future reserve adjustments  both positive and negative  to proved reserves and appropriate risk adjusted probable and possible reserves ii results of future drilling activities  iii management price outlooks and iv increases or decreases in production and capital costs associated with these fields

in general  upon conversion of a convertible senior note  the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the convertible senior note and common stock for the convertible senior note conversion value in excess of the principal amount 
the company anticipates redeeming all notes that remain outstanding during  however  the decision to exercise the redemption option will depend on market and other conditions  and the company may choose not to redeem the notes during or at all 
if the company exercises its redemption option  the convertible senior notes will automatically become convertible during the period between when the company gives notice of its intent to redeem the convertible senior notes and the date on which the convertible senior notes are actually redeemed 
if the company exercises its redemption option and the company stock price averages above per share during the conversion period  the company expects that the note holders will exercise their right to convert the convertible senior notes  receiving cash and shares of common stock  rather than allow their securities to be redeemed by the company for cash

table of contents pioneer natural resources company debt ratings 
the company receives debt credit ratings from several of the major ratings agencies  which are subject to regular reviews 
the company believes that each of the rating agencies considers many factors in determining the company ratings  including production growth opportunities  liquidity  debt levels and asset composition and proved reserve mix 
a reduction in the company debt ratings could negatively affect the company ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate  fees and other terms associated with such additional financing

book capitalization and current ratio 
the company net book capitalization at december  was billion  consisting of million of cash and cash equivalents  debt of billion and stockholders equity of billion

see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a comprehensive discussion of the company significant accounting policies 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the following is a discussion of the company most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the company application of gaap 
asset retirement obligations 
the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore the land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
the company removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations  a corresponding adjustment is generally made to the oil and gas property balance 
see notes b and i of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company asset retirement obligations 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method 
in general  the company believes that net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method  particularly during periods of active exploration 
the critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows under the successful efforts method  exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur  whereas  under the full cost method of accounting  such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets  pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense 
during  and  the company recognized exploration  abandonment  geological and geophysical expense from continuing operations of million  million and million  respectively 
during  and  the company recognized exploration  abandonment  geological and geophysical expense from discontinued operations of thousand  million and million  respectively  under the successful efforts method 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of the company proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the company proved reserve information included in this report as of december   and was prepared by the company engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the company major properties 
estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 

table of contents pioneer natural resources company because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify  positively or negatively  material revisions to the estimate of proved reserves 
it should not be assumed that the standardized measure included in this report as of december  is the current market value of the company estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the standardized measure on a month average of commodity prices on the first day of the month and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate 
see item a 
risk factors and item properties for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves 
the company estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which the company records depletion expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower commodity prices  which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the company assessment of its proved properties and goodwill for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
the company reviews its proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon estimated future recoverable proved and risk adjusted probable and possible reserves  management price outlooks  production and capital costs expected to be incurred to recover the reserves  discount rates commensurate with the nature of the properties and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
see notes b and d of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for information regarding the company impairment assessments 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties 
at december   the company carried unproved property costs of million 
management assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment on a project by project basis 
management impairment assessments include evaluating the results of exploration activities  management price outlooks and planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects 
suspended wells 
the company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the discovery 
the ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions 
if the company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields  the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense 
the company does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory well as an asset in its consolidated balance sheets following the completion of drilling unless both of the following conditions are met i the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well 
ii the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain projects  it may take an extended period of time to evaluate the future potential of an exploration project and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability 
in these instances  the project feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology  but rather the company ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information  gaining access to other companies production  transportation or processing facilities and or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells 
these activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly 
consequently  the company assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves to sanction the project or is noncommercial and is impaired 
see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company suspended exploratory well costs 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets  if any  will be realized prior to their expiration 
pioneer monitors company specific  oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the company net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the company to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period 

table of contents pioneer natural resources company goodwill impairment 
the company reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually 
during the third quarter of  the company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the company determined that it was not likely that the company goodwill was impaired 
for assessments prior to  the company was required to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have goodwill 
there is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values  particularly in determining the valuation methodologies to utilize  the estimation of proved reserves as described above and the weighting of different valuation methodologies applied 
the carrying value of the company goodwill was assessed and found not to be impaired during the years ended december  and see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding goodwill and assessments of goodwill for impairment 
litigation and environmental contingencies 
the company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation 
actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons 
the costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages 
similarly  environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations  developing information relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 
under gaap  a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable 
see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company commitments and contingencies 
valuation of stock based compensation 
in accordance with gaap  the company calculates the fair value of stock based compensation using various valuation methods 
the valuation methods require the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value 
the company utilizes a the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options  b the closing stock price on the day prior to the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards  c the closing stock price at the balance sheet date for restricted stock awards that are expected to be settled wholly or partially in cash on their vesting date  d the monte carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards  and e a probability forecasted fair value method for series b unit awards issued by sendero drilling company  llc

the assets and liabilities that the company periodically measures and records at fair value include trading securities  commodity derivative contracts and interest rate contracts 
the company also measures and discloses certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  such as long term debt 
the valuation methods used by the company to measure the fair values of these assets and liabilities require considerable management judgment and estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value estimates  such as future prices  credit adjusted risk free rates and current volatility factors
