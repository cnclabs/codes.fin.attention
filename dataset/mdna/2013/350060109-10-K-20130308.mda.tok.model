union pacific railroad product warranty claim on july   the uprr notified uprr notice us and our subsidiary  cxt incorporated cxt  of a warranty claim under cxt s supply contract relating to the sale of prestressed concrete railroad ties to the uprr 
the uprr asserted that a significant percentage of concrete ties manufactured in through at cxt s grand island  ne facility failed to meet contract specifications  had workmanship defects and were cracking and failing prematurely 
approximately million ties were sold from grand island  ne to the uprr during the period the uprr had claimed nonconformance 
the contract called for each concrete tie which failed to conform to the specifications or had a material defect in workmanship to be replaced with new concrete ties  provided  that uprr within five years of the sale of a concrete tie  notified cxt of such failure to conform or such defect in workmanship 
the uprr notice did not specify how many ties manufactured during this period were defective nor the exact nature of the alleged workmanship defect 
additionally  uprr notified us that a customer of the uprr asserted that a representative sample of ties manufactured by our grand island  ne facility failed a test contained in the contract specification 
at the customer s request  uprr removed approximately  concrete ties  which were a subset of the ties subject to the uprr notice 
beginning in july through the second quarter of  we worked with material scientists and prestressed concrete experts to test a representative sample of grand island  ne concrete ties and assess warranty claims for certain concrete ties made in the grand island  ne facility between and we discontinued manufacturing operations in grand island  ne in early during  we completed sufficient testing and analysis to further understand this matter 
additionally  in a combined effort with uprr  we analyzed grand island  ne concrete ties in track 
based upon these findings  we believed we discovered conditions  which largely related to the to manufacturing period  that can shorten the life of the concrete ties produced during this period 
we also agreed on a process with the uprr for identifying  prioritizing and replacing ties that meet the criteria for replacement 
this process will be applied to the ties we shipped to the uprr from our grand island  ne facility from to during most of this period our warranty policy for uprr carried a year warranty with a replacement ratio for any defective ties 
in order to accommodate the uprr and other customer concerns  we reverted to a previously used warranty policy 
this will result in all concrete ties with a year warranty and a replacement ratio  now having a year warranty and a replacement ratio 
this change will provide an additional years of warranty protection 
the replacement ratio will furnish one tie for each tie replaced under our claims process 
during the fourth quarter of  we reached agreement with the uprr resulting in our and the uprr working together to identify and replace defective ties 
the process of planning and documenting will be done by both us and the uprr to ensure this is done in a timely manner 
in connection with this agreement  we and the uprr agreed on a cash payment of million to the uprr as compensation for concrete ties replaced by the uprr during the investigation period 
during  as a result of testing we conducted on concrete ties manufactured at our former grand island  ne facility and of the related developments of the uprr and other customer matters  we recorded pre tax warranty charges of approximately million in cost of goods sold within our rail products segment based on our estimate of the number of defective concrete ties that will ultimately require replacement during the applicable warranty periods 
dispositions on june   we sold the assets and liabilities of our railway securement business  ssd  to holland  lp for million resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
on august   we sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our structural products business  precise  to cianbro fabrication and coating corporation for million resulting in a pre tax loss of million 
we reclassified the results of the operations of these businesses as discontinued and reclassified all prior periods 
we do not expect future expenses of the discontinued operations to be material 
additional information regarding our discontinued operations can be found in part ii  item  note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in part ii  item  note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
goodwill goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of october st or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present 
the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss 
this step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded as a component of continuing operating activities 
the company uses a combination of market approach and a discounted cash flow model dcf model to determine the current fair value of the business 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volume and pricing  costs to produce and working capital changes 
the company considers historical experience and available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated 
however  actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  the company may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
there were no goodwill impairments recorded during the three years ended december  asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the applicable guidance requires that  if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is highly susceptible to change from period to period and because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
there were no asset impairments recorded during the three years ended december  product warranty the company maintains a current warranty for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  an accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction projects  a product warranty accrual is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the product warranty accrual is periodically adjusted based on the identification or resolution of known individual product warranty claims 
the underlying assumptions used to calculate the product warranty accrual can change from period to period and are dependent upon estimates of the amount and cost of future product repairs or replacements 
at december  and  the product warranty was million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  the company recorded product warranty expense of million  million and million  respectively
