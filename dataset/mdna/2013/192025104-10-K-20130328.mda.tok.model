table of contents critical accounting estimates disclosure of codorus valley s significant accounting policies is included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
some of these policies require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management makes significant estimates in determining the allowance for loan losses  valuation of foreclosed real estate  and evaluation of other than temporary impairment losses of securities 
management considers a variety of factors in establishing allowance for loan losses such as current economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews  financial and managerial strength of borrowers  adequacy of collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors 
there is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as a result of regulatory examinations 
foreclosed real estate is initially recorded at fair value minus estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
appraisals are generally used to determine fair value 
after foreclosure  management reviews valuations at least quarterly and adjusts the asset to the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell 
estimates related to the value of collateral can have a significant impact on whether or not management continues to accrue income on delinquent and impaired loans and on the amounts at which foreclosed real estate is recorded on the statement of financial condition 
the corporation records its available for sale securities portfolio at fair value 
fair values for these securities are determined based on methodologies in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic fair values for debt securities are volatile and may be influenced by any number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  credit ratings and yield curves 
fair values for debt securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security 
when the fair value of a debt security is below its amortized cost and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost  additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other than temporary impairment condition exists 
debt securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the analysis considers whether the corporation has the intent to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity and whether it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity 
often  information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing  making estimates of fair value subject to judgment 
if actual information or conditions are different than estimated  the extent of the impairment of the debt security may be different than previously estimated  which could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
management discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related management discussion and analysis disclosure with the audit committee 
there were no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented within this report 
additional information is contained in management s discussion and analysis regarding critical accounting estimates  including the provision and allowance for loan losses  located on pages and of this report 

table of contents overview executive summary net income available to common shareholders earnings for the year increased  or percent above the year  driven primarily by a decrease in the provision for loan losses and an increase in net interest income 
the  or percent pretax decrease in the provision for loan losses for the year reflected improved credit quality and a decrease in loan impairment charges compared to the year the  or percent pretax increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in the average volume of earnings assets  principally commercial loans  as the corporation leveraged its capital addition in a decrease in funding costs  resulting from the unusually low level of market interest rates and from a larger proportion of low cost core deposits to total deposits  also contributed significantly to the increase in net interest income 
the level of core deposits  which for internal purposes includes repurchase agreements but excludes certificates of deposit  has trended up over the years and at december  comprised approximately percent of total deposits 
given the low interest rate environment  the economy and the relatively high level of unemployment  our depositors have shown a preference for liquidity 
a challenge for the corporation and the financial industry will be the retention of low cost core deposits when market interest rates eventually ramp up 
according to recent pronouncements by the federal reserve s federal open market committee  market interest rates could begin to rise in given the economy  the level of unemployment and general declines in housing prices there has been little demand for consumer loans 
in contrast  residential mortgage loan refinancings increased significantly as homeowners took advantage of historically low market interest rates 
refinanced residential mortgage loans were sold to investors thereby generating a record level of income gains for the year given the long duration of low market interest rates  refinancing activity is expected to reach a saturation level resulting in decreased residential mortgage loan production and revenue therefrom at some point in the future

the branch will be operated out of leased office space and  subject to regulatory approval  is scheduled to be operational in may branch office expansion is expected to increase noninterest expenses such as personnel  occupancy  furniture and equipment  and marketing  among other expenses 
the discussion that follows addresses changes in selected noninterest expense categories 
personnel personnel expense is comprised of wages  sales commissions  payroll taxes and employee benefits  such as medical insurance and k plans 
the  or percent increase in personnel expense for  compared to  was attributable to normal business growth  which included the full year s impact of a branch office addition in september  increased sales commissions for mortgage originators which resulted from increased production  and the accrual of annual performance incentives 
comparatively  the  or percent increase in personnel expense for  compared to  was also attributable to normal business growth  which included a partial year s impact for the aforementioned branch office addition 
the rate of increase in personnel expense for the year was limited by the decrease in wages caused by the resignation of four registered representatives and an office manager who left peoplesbank subsidiary cvfa in february effective august   peoplesbank converted from a fully insured health care program to a self insured program by joining a consortium of approximately banks 
employees have customarily reimbursed the corporation for approximately percent of the cost of health insurance 
for the year  compared to the year  the cost of the self insured program decreased approximately  or percent due to a decrease in claims expense and a decrease in the insured pool as a result of program changes 
occupancy of premises  net occupancy of premises expense is comprised of rent  depreciation  maintenance  insurance  real estate taxes and utilities 
the level of expense can vary annually based upon franchise expansion  repairs and maintenance  and normal business growth 
examples of franchise expansion include the addition of a branch banking office in and the relocation of an existing branch banking office during to a more favorable site 
furniture and equipment this category includes depreciation expense on furniture and equipment  including it related equipment  and the cost of computer hardware and software maintenance contracts among other expenses 
the upward trend in this expense category reflects normal business growth  including price increases  it initiatives such as crm described below and the addition of a branch banking office in during the third quarter of  peoplesbank began implementing a client relationship management crm system  which  in addition to computer hardware  is comprised of two main components  sales and service software and teller software

the teller software component  which will be phased in by individual branch office  is expected to be fully operational by the fall of the capital outlay for this project is estimated at  which does not include staffing and other ancillary expenses 
a properly managed crm process is expected to improve the corporation s competitiveness and client service and retention 

table of contents professional and legal the level of professional and legal expense can vary annually based on the varying needs for legal  accounting and consulting services  which is driven in part by the level of routine lawsuits in the ordinary course of business  the number and complexity of corporate initiatives  and changes in regulatory compliance requirements 
marketing and advertising expense for the three years presented shows an upward trend that reflects an increased operating budget to support normal business growth and increased corporate initiatives such as branding  product advertising and internal promotions 
fdic insurance expense for the three years presented shows a downward trend  which reflects a decrease in the assessment rate 
the decrease in the assessment rate was due to peoplesbank s improved financial performance and a change in the methodology for calculating insurance premiums by the fdic 
effective april   the fdic lowered assessment rates and applied them against average assets minus average tangible capital  instead of domestic deposits 
more information about fdic insurance assessments is available under the supervision and regulation section of this report reference the subheading fdic 
debit card processing expense for the three years presented shows an upward trend  which reflects increases in the number of new accounts and transaction volume 
this expense category also includes the cost of operating automated teller machines 
charitable donations the level of charitable donations  principally educational and scholarship donations  is based  in part  upon whether or not peoplesbank can obtain related state tax credits if available from nonprofit organizations 
accordingly  the level of charitable donations can vary from year to year 
for example  the decrease in charitable donations for resulted from the denial or delay of tax credits by the state of pennsylvania for educational donations due to budgetary constraints 
peoplesbank uses state tax credits from donations to reduce its pennsylvania shares tax expense  included below in other expenses 
foreclosed real estate including gains losses on sales net foreclosed real estate expense is comprised of impairment losses  including losses on sales  and carrying costs  net of gains from sales and income generated by the real estate 
typical carrying costs include insurance  maintenance and repairs  real estate taxes  appraisals and legal fees 
net foreclosed real estate expense remained elevated for the three years presented due to the level of carrying costs and impairment losses from deterioration of property values associated with specific properties as well as the size of the portfolio  which was reflective of prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions and the erosion of real estate values 
real estate expense for the year increased  or percent compared to the year as a result of increased provisioning for impairment losses  including the  provision related to a foreclosed property  as previously reported on form k dated august  and filed with the sec 
for the year  foreclosed real estate expense decreased  or percent  compared to the year  due in part to the recognition of rental income totaling  from a real estate project and a decrease in the provision for real estate losses 
for the year  the provision for real estate losses totaled  compared to  for impaired loan carrying costs the prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions may cause fluctuations in impaired loan carrying costs 
factors such as the number and size of the loans in the impaired loan portfolio  financial capacity of the borrower or guarantor  value and liquidity of underlying collateral and the timing of when and for how long loans are classified as impaired  among other factors  contribute to the variability of this expense from period to period 
carrying costs are the same as those described for foreclosed real estate 

table of contents other other expense is comprised of many underlying expenses  including  but not limited to pennsylvania shares tax  memberships and subscriptions  director fees  liability insurance  third party courier  correspondent banking expenses and miscellaneous operating losses 
for the year  the  or percent increase in the other expense category above the year reflected a nonrecurring charge off of the unamortized balance of an intangible asset totaling  varying levels of pennsylvania shares tax expense  which reflected varying levels of state tax credits that originated from charitable donations as described earlier can cause annual variances in the other expense category 
for example  shares tax  net of credits  totaled  for  compared to  for and  for the upward trend in the other expense category for the three year period presented also reflects normal business growth

securities  available for sale the investment securities portfolio is an interest earning asset  second in size to the loan portfolio 
investment securities serve as an important source of revenue and liquidity 
they also serve as collateral for public and trust deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and to support borrowings 
the investment securities portfolio is managed to comply with the corporation s investment securities policy  and accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic decisions to purchase or sell securities are based on an assessment of current economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  the demand for loans  and liquidity and income requirements

table of contents table investment securities dollars in thousands amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value available for sale debt securities us treasury notes us agency us agency mortgage backed  residential state and municipal total at december   the fair value of the securities  available for sale totaled million  approximately the same level as december  throughout the year  cash inflows from maturities and repayments  and the proceeds from sales of securities were reinvested back into the investment securities portfolio 
approximately million of us agency mortgage backed securities mbs were selectively sold to remove relatively low yielding instruments that were prepaying faster than anticipated and small odd lot securities from the mbs portfolio 
the sales of mbs during the year resulted in the realization of net gains totaling  during the year  peoplesbank took advantage of the low interest rate environment and sold selected securities  which generated net gains of  that were recognized in income 
included in the net gains for was an  loss associated with the sale of eleven municipal bonds totaling approximately million par value that no longer met the corporation s investment standards 
securities  available for sale are generally comprised of high quality debt instruments 
included in table are investments in the obligations of states and municipalities 
during the fourth quarter of bonds issued by states and municipalities received negative national press because of widespread budget deficits and  by implication  the possibility of default 
we believe that selected investment in municipal bonds is a sound investment practice 
municipalities have many options for meeting their debt obligations  including decreasing costs and service levels  imposing taxes and selling assets 
in many cases  municipal debt issues are insured or  in the case of school districts of selected states  backed by specific reserves  which provide a layer of protection to the investor 
access to the credit market and a good credit rating are high priorities of municipal management enabling it to meet its current and future funding needs at a reasonable interest cost 
for these reasons  defaults on municipal bonds are very low  well below percent 
with the exception of an approximately million portfolio fair value of texas municipal utility district bonds  which has its own criteria for investment  the remaining municipal bonds are almost all rated a or above by at least one national statistical rating organization at december  the majority of bonds in our portfolio are general obligation bonds  which can draw upon multiple sources of revenue  including taxes  for payment

many of the municipal holdings are also insured or backed by specific school district loss reserves 
on january   provision a of the dodd frank act becomes effective  which changes the definition of investment grade by removing reliance on credit ratings by national statistical rating organizations 
investment grade under the revised definition requires an active review ie  pre purchase and post purchase credit risk analysis of the obligor to determine that the obligor has an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments and more specifically that the risk of default is low and that full and timely repayment of principal and interest is expected 
obligations of the us government and us government sponsored enterprises are not subject to the due diligence requirement  however  municipal and corporate obligations are subject to the new requirement

in june  the corporation restructured ie  extended two outstanding million fhlbp advances million total to lock in low rates as a hedge against the possibility of rising market interest rates in the future 
this transaction resulted in a  prepayment penalty that has been deferred and embedded in the rates on the restructured advances where it will be recognized as interest expense over their respective repayment terms

total shareholders equity was million on december   compared to million at year end the increase in equity was the result of an increase in retained earnings from profitable operations 
dividends on preferred stock as previously disclosed  the corporation participates in the us department of the treasury s treasury small business lending fund program sblf program 
under this program  the corporation issued million  or  shares of non cumulative  perpetual preferred stock  series b   liquidation value  par value to the treasury

on september   the dividend rate becomes fixed at the then prevailing rate for the remaining two and one half years of the initial four and one half year phase of the sblf program 
after four and one half years from issuance the dividend rate will increase to percent 
dividends on common stock the corporation typically pays cash dividends on its common stock on a quarterly basis

compensation plans as disclosed in this report  the corporation maintains various employee  director and shareholder benefit plans that could result in the issuance of its common stock or affect its earnings 
information regarding these plans can be found in note benefit plans and note stock based compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preferred and common stock information pertaining to preferred and common stock issued by the corporation is disclosed in note shareholders equity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
capital ratios the corporation and peoplesbank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators that involve quantitative guidelines and qualitative judgments 
quantitative measures established by regulators pertain to minimum capital ratios  as set forth in table the table provides a comparison of the corporation s and peoplesbank s risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios to the minimum regulatory requirement for the periods indicated 
on june   the federal regulatory agencies jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would revise the general risk based capital rules to incorporate certain revisions by the basel committee on banking supervision to the basel capital framework ie  basel iii 
generally  the proposed rule revises the definition of regulatory capital components and related calculations  adds a new common equity tier capital ratio  implements a new capital conservation buffer  increases the risk weighting for residential mortgages and past due loans  and provides a transition period for several aspects of the proposed rule 
the standards set forth in the proposed rule would require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital  with a greater emphasis on common equity 
subsequent to the review and comment period on the proposal which ended october   the banking regulators announced that the project was being delayed 
the timing for adoption of final rules to implement the basel iii capital framework is uncertain 
accordingly  final rules applicable to the corporation and bank may be substantially different from the basel iii framework initially proposed

risk management the corporation s risk management committee committee meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and an independent director 
the objective of the committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the corporation and its affiliates 
while the committee s risk review is broad in scope  its primary responsibility is to develop  implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures 
credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a loan client  counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms  posing one of the most significant risks of loss to the corporation 
accordingly  the corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk 
to support this objective a sound lending policy framework has been established 
this framework includes seven basic policies that guide the lending process and minimize risk 
first  the corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures 
second  lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount  loan type  level of risk  and loan officer experience 
third  loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the board level to review and approve loans that exceed pre established dollar thresholds and or meet other criteria 
fourth  the corporation lends mainly within its primary geographical market area  york county  pennsylvania and northern central maryland 
although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk  the diverse local economy and employee knowledge of customers lessens this risk 
fifth  the loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single customer or small group of related customers 
sixth  the corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market  nor does it invest in securities backed by subprime mortgages 
and seventh  the corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein 

table of contents the corporation uses loan to value ratios ltv ratios  establishing generally acceptable ratios of the loan amount to the value of the collateral securing the loan  to minimize the risk of loss from the loan portfolio 
at december   the ltv ratios listed below were in effect 
loan type ltv ratio residential  owner occupied units  tax assessment md residential  owner occupied units  tax assessment york  pa residential  owner occupied units  certified appraisal residential  non owner occupied units  certified appraisal residential  or more units agricultural commercial industrial vacant land depending on improvements  approvals special limited use properties an acceptable valuation is required on all real estate secured loans 
generally  an appraisal performed by an independent licensed appraiser is required for real estate secured loans where the amount is above  or is non owner occupied  or if the ltv ratio is above percent for commercial property or above the limits shown in the above schedule for valuations based on tax assessments for owner occupied residential property  or if an existing appraisal is more than two years old assuming that there has been no material change in market conditions or the physical aspects of the property 
exceptions to ltv ratios and the use of a licensed appraiser are sometimes made by management or the board of directors when there are compensating factors 
one component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations  defined as greater than percent of the total loan portfolio 
the corporation had two industry concentrations that exceeded percent of the total loan portfolio builder developer were percent and of the portfolio at december  and  respectively  and commercial real estate investor was and percent of the portfolio  respectively 
loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate 
in addition to a comprehensive lending policy  numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year 
loan portfolios are also reviewed by independent auditors in connection with their annual financial statement audit and are examined periodically by bank regulators 
nonperforming assets the following table presents a five year history of asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss and related ratios 
we generally place a loan on nonaccrual status and cease accruing interest income  ie  recognize interest income on a cash basis as long as the loan is sufficiently collateralized  when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due days or more 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest represent loans that are contractually past due  but are well collateralized and in the process of collection 
foreclosed real estate represents real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to peoplesbank 
the final category  troubled debt restructurings  pertains to loans whose terms have been modified to include a concession that we would not ordinarily consider due to the debtor s financial difficulties 
concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring typically involve a reduction of interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk  the deferral of payments or extension of the stated maturity date 
troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment if they have been restructured during the most recent calendar year  or if they cease to perform in accordance with the modified terms 
the paragraphs below explain significant changes in the aforementioned categories for december   compared to december  
table of contents nonperforming assets are reviewed by management on a monthly basis 
we generally rely on appraisals performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of collateral for impaired collateral dependent loans 
generally  an appraisal is performed when an account reaches days past due  unless a certified appraisal was completed within the past six months  market values have changed significantly  the condition of the property has changed significantly  or the existing appraisal is outdated 
in instances where the value of the collateral is less than the net carrying amount of the loan  a specific loss allowance is established for the difference by recording a loss provision to the income statement 
when it is probable that some portion or all of the loan balance will not be collected  that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance 
generally  a loan is returned to interest accruing status when we determine that circumstances have improved to the extent that all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are current for at least six consecutive payments and future payments are reasonably assured 
table nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans  troubled debt restructurings accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest total nonperforming loans foreclosed real estate  net of allowance total nonperforming assets accruing troubled debt restructurings ratios total period end loans  net of deferred fees allowance for loan losses all all as a of total period end loans annualized net charge offs recoveries as a of average total loans all as a of nonperforming loans nonperforming loans as a of total period end loans nonperforming assets as a of total period end loans and net foreclosed real estate nonperforming assets as a of total period end assets nonperforming assets as a of total period end shareholders equity the level of nonperforming assets  while relatively high in comparison to the corporation s historic level  has trended down over the last four years 
significant progress in reducing the level of nonperforming assets was accomplished in the year  compared to  as a result of recoveries from borrower payments and foreclosed real estate sales  loan charge offs and the establishment of valuation allowances for selective accounts 
while progress has been made in reducing nonperforming assets  we remain concerned about prolonged weak economic conditions and the corresponding effects it has on our commercial borrowers 

table of contents nonaccrual loans we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly and have established a loss allowance for selected loan relationships where the net realizable value of the collateral is insufficient to repay the loan 
in this regard  allowances  if applicable  are noted below within the description of the loan 
collection efforts  including modification of contractual terms for individual accounts based on prevailing market conditions and liquidation of collateral assets  are being employed to maximize recovery 
further provisions for loan losses may be required for nonaccrual loans as additional information becomes available or conditions change 
there is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance as a result of regulatory examinations 
a loan is returned to interest accruing status when we determine that circumstances have improved to the extent that all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are current for at least six consecutive payments and future payments are reasonably assured 
on december   the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance totaled  compared to  at year end the decrease in nonaccrual loans was primarily the result of the payoff in full of two large commercial loans during  which more than offset nonaccrual loan additions 
on december   the nonaccrual loan portfolio was comprised of nineteen unrelated loan relationships  principally collateralized commercial loans  with outstanding principal balances ranging in size from  to  four unrelated commercial relationships  which represent the majority of the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance  are described below 
loan no 
at december   the outstanding principal balance of the loan relationship was  collateralized by commercial rental properties whose rents are assigned to peoplesbank 
based on a recent appraisal of the primary real estate collateralizing the relationship  we believe that the loans are adequately collateralized 
the borrower is presently operating under a troubled debt restructuring agreement 
loan no 
at december   the outstanding principal balance of the loan relationship was  collateralized by two commercial properties 
based on an independent appraisal of the real estate collateralizing the relationship  we believe that the loans are adequately collateralized 
the bank is presently pursuing its legal remedies to recover the amount due 
loan no 
at december   the outstanding principal balance of the loan relationship was  which represents three commercial loans guaranteed from to  depending upon the specific loan  by the us department of agriculture 
a  allowance for loan losses was established for this relationship 
several parcels of improved real estate provide collateral for the loans 
the bank is working through the process to liquidate the real estate 
loan no 
peoplesbank owns a percent participation interest in this loan relationship 
the carrying value of the bank s principal at december   was  which reflects a payment totaling  from the sale of collateral during january the bank is pursuing its legal options against parties to the original loan agreement  including the liquidation of remaining collateral 
as previously disclosed  peoplesbank charged off  as a loss in september due to deterioration in the value of the collateral 
for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately  the amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for was approximately  the interest income recognized on impaired loans  which includes nonaccrual loans  in note loans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  is a lesser amount because it includes interest income only from the time the loan was impaired 

table of contents at december   there were approximately million in potential problem loans being closely monitored by management 
potential problem loans consist of loans classified as substandard where we have doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms  and which are not disclosed in table a loss allowance totaling  was established at december   for those potential problem commercial loans that  in our judgment  were under collateralized 
comparatively  we were monitoring approximately million of potential problem loans at december  foreclosed real estate on december   foreclosed real estate  net of allowance  totaled  compared to  at december  the  or percent decrease was due primarily to the sale of real estate and secondarily to an increase in the allowance for real estate losses for selected properties 
on december   the portfolio was comprised of five unrelated accounts ranging in size from  to  which in general  we are actively attempting to liquidate 
if a valuation allowance for probable loss has been established for a particular property it is so noted in the property description below 
further valuation allowances may be required on any foreclosed property as additional information becomes available or conditions change 
foreclosed real estate is included in the other assets category on the corporation s balance sheet 
three unrelated foreclosed real estate properties  which represent the majority of the foreclosed real estate portfolio balance  are described below 
property no 
the carrying amount of this property at december  was  which is net of a  allowance for probable loss based on an independent appraisal less estimated selling costs 
this account is collateralized by acres of unimproved land that is zoned for residential development 
based on information obtained in  plans to obtain a formal development plan were suspended with the intent to temporarily retain the property and investigate other development  disposition or income generating options at some future date 
impairment loss for this property totaled  for the year  which is reflected in the allowance 
property no 
the carrying amount of this property at december  was  which is net of a  allowance for probable loss based on the results of an independent appraisal less estimated selling costs 
during the third quarter of  a  impairment loss and corresponding increase in the allowance were recognized as reported on form k filed on august  the impairment recorded in the third quarter follows a  impairment loss and corresponding increase in the allowance recorded in the second quarter of this account is collateralized by approved residential building lots 
of this total  lots are improved 
management is evaluating its disposition options with regard to this property 
property no 
the carrying amount of this property at december  was  which represents the value of the borrower s personal residence presently listed for sale less estimated selling costs 
earlier in the year  the corporation recovered  from the sale of additional real estate collateral 

table of contents allowance for loan losses although the corporation maintains sound credit policies  certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
the allowance is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis  which is subject to review and approval by the board 
an overview of the methodology and key factors that we use in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance and loan impairment is provided in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses consists primarily of three components specific allowances for individually impaired commercial loans  allowances calculated for pools of loans  and an unallocated component  which reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the assumptions that underlie the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance 
the corporation uses an internal risk rating system to evaluate individual loans 
loans are segmented into industry groups or pools with similar characteristics  and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on quantitative factors such as recent loss history two year rolling average of net charge offs and qualitative factors  such as the results of internal and external credit reviews  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  adequacy of collateral  general economic conditions and the local business outlook 
determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
we must make estimates using assumptions and information that is often subjective and fluid 
there is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance as a result of regulatory examinations 
table analysis of allowance for loan losses presents an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five year period 
a more detailed analysis of the allowance for the current year is provided in note allowance for loan losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance was  or percent of total loans  on december   compared to  and percent  respectively  on december  for the year  net charge offs totaled  which was well below the  for the year the level of charge offs in were unusually high due to the inclusion of partial charge offs for two unrelated commercial loans totaling  the decrease in the level of net charge offs lowered the net charge off ratio to percent for the year  compared to percent for the year the risks and uncertainties associated with prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions  a relatively high level of unemployment and erosion of real estate values  which adversely affect our borrowers ability to service their loans  can cause significant fluctuations in the level of charge offs and provision expense from one period to another 
based on a comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio  we believe that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december

table of contents liquidity maintaining adequate liquidity provides the corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors  loan customers  employees  and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business 
additionally  it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise 
liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the corporation s assets and liabilities 
the primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows  funds received from customer loan payments  and asset sales 
the primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth  short term borrowings and long term debt 
the consolidated statements of cash flows  included in this report  present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
at year end  we believe that liquidity was adequate based upon the potential liquidation of unpledged available for sale securities with a fair value totaling approximately million and available credit from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh totaling approximately million 
the corporation s loan to deposit ratio was approximately percent for year end  compared to percent for year end off balance sheet arrangements the corporation s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
these commitments consist primarily of commitments to grant new loans  unfunded commitments under existing loan facilities  and letters of credit issued under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are disclosed in note commitments to extend credit in the notes to the consolidated financial statements totaled million at december   compared to million at december  normally these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes 
accordingly  many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and therefore  generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the corporation or peoplesbank 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the level of inflation can be measured by the change in the consumer price index cpi for all urban consumers december vs 
december 
the change in the cpi for was percent  compared to percent for and percent for management believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in market interest rates 
management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  management is focused on increasing fee income  an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable to smaller reporting companies 

table of contents report of management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting the corporation carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of the corporation s management  including the corporation s chief executive officer and chief financial officer  of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures  as defined in exchange act rules a e and d e 
based upon the evaluation  the corporation s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that  as of december   the corporation s disclosure controls and procedures are effective 
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the corporation s reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission s rules and forms 
the management of the corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
the corporation s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of december   using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework  with an emphasis on internal control over financial reporting guidance for smaller public companies  also issued by coso 
based on this assessment  management concluded that  as of december   the corporation s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 
this annual report does not include an attestation report of the corporation s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting as no such report is required 
management s report was not subject to attestation by the corporation s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit the corporation to provide only management s report in this annual report
