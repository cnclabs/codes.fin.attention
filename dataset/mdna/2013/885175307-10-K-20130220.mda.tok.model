the following presentation of management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview continuing operations cardiovascular business thoratec corporation we  our  us  thoratec or the company is the world leader in mechanical circulatory support with a product portfolio to treat the full range of clinical needs for advanced heart failure patients 
we develop  manufacture and market proprietary medical devices used for circulatory support 
we develop  manufacture and market proprietary medical devices used for mechanical circulatory support mcs for the treatment of heart failure hf patients 
for chronic circulatory support for hf patients  our primary product lines are our ventricular assist devices vads heartmate left ventricular assist system heartmate xve  heartmate ii left ventricular assist system heartmate ii  thoratec paracorporeal ventricular assist device pvad  and thoratec implantable ventricular assist device ivad 
we refer to heartmate xve and heartmate ii collectively as the heartmate product line and pvad and ivad collectively as the thoratec product line 
for acute circulatory support  our product lines are centrimag acute circulatory system centrimag and for pediatric patients pedimag pedivas acute circulatory system pedimag pedivas 
heartmate xve  heartmate ii  pvad  ivad  centrimag and pedimag pedivas are approved by the us food and drug administration fda  and have received conformit europ ene ce mark approval in europe 
mcs devices supplement the pumping function of the heart in patients with hf 
in most cases  a cannula connects the left ventricle of the heart to a blood pump 
blood flows from the left ventricle to the pump chamber via the cannula  powered by an electric or air driven mechanism that drives the blood through another cannula into the aorta 
from the aorta  the blood then circulates throughout the body 
mechanical or tissue valves enable unidirectional flow in some devices 
currently  the power source remains outside the body for all fda approved mcs devices 
some of our devices can also provide support for the right side of the heart 

table of contents heartmate ii heartmate ii is an implantable  electrically powered  continuous flow  left ventricular assist device lvad consisting of a rotary blood pump designed to provide intermediate and long term mcs 
heartmate ii is designed to improve survival and quality of life for a broad range of advanced hf patients 
significantly smaller than heartmate xve and with only one moving part  heartmate ii is simpler and designed to operate more quietly than pulsatile devices 
heartmate ii received fda approval in april for bridge to transplantation btt and received fda approval for use in hf patients who are not eligible for heart transplantation destination therapy or dt in january in november  heartmate ii received ce mark approval 
the heartmate ii is most widely used and standard lvad 
heartmate xve heartmate xve is an implantable  pulsatile  left ventricular assist device for intermediate and longer term mcs 
patients with a heartmate xve do not require anticoagulation drugs  other than aspirin  because of the product incorporation of proprietary textured surfaces and tissue valves 
we discontinued the sale of heartmate xve at the end of fiscal heartmate xve received fda approval for btt in december and for dt in april in june  heartmate xve received ce mark approval 
centrimag centrimag is an extracorporeal full flow acute surgical support platform incorporating a polycarbonate pump  based on magnetically levitated bearingless motor technology 
centrimag is cleared by the fda for use up to six hours in patients requiring short term extracorporeal circulatory support during cardiac surgery 
additionally  centrimag is approved under an fda humanitarian device exemption hde to be used as a right ventricular assist device for periods of support up to thirty days in patients in cardiogenic shock due to acute right ventricular failure 
we have an ongoing study to evaluate the effectiveness of the centrimag for periods of support up to thirty days 
centrimag has ce mark approval to provide support for up to thirty days for both cardiac and respiratory failure 
on august   we completed the acquisition of the medical business of levitronix llc levitronix medical 
prior to the acquisition  we provided distribution and clinical support to levitronix medical in the us for centrimag under an agreement that would have expired at the end of pedimag pedivas pedimag and pedivas are identical  extracorporeal full flow acute surgical support platforms incorporating a polycarbonate pump  based on magnetically levitated bearingless motor technology  designed to provide acute surgical support to pediatric patients 
the brand names differ according to indication for use  duration of support  and regulatory approval 
pedimag is cleared by the fda for use  in conjunction with the centrimag console and motor  for support periods of up to six hours 
outside the us  the device is branded as pedivas 
this device has ce mark to provide support for up to days for both cardiac and respiratory failure 
pvad pvad is an external  pulsatile  vad  fda approved for btt  including home discharge and post cardiotomy myocardial recovery and provides left  right  and biventricular mcs 
pvad is a paracorporeal device that is less invasive than implantable vads since only the cannula is implanted 
the paracorporeal nature of pvad provides several benefits including shorter implantation times approximately two hours and the ability to use the device in smaller patients 
a pneumatic power source drives pvad 
it is designed for short to intermediate duration for post cardiotomy myocardial recovery following cardiac surgery and btt 
pvad and ivad  described below  offer left  right or biventricular support for use for btt 
this characteristic is significant because the vast majority of btt patients treated with pvad and ivad require right as well as left side ventricular assistance 
pvad and ivad are also the only devices approved for both btt and recovery following cardiac surgery 
pvad incorporates our proprietary biomaterial  thoralon  which has excellent tissue and blood compatibility and is resistant to blood clots 

table of contents pvad received fda approval for btt in december and for recovery post cardiotomy in may in june  pvad received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
ivad ivad is an implantable  pulsatile  vad  fda approved for btt  including home discharge  and post cardiotomy myocardial recovery and provides left  right or biventricular mcs 
ivad maintains the same blood flow path  valves and blood pumping mechanism as pvad  but has an outer housing made of a titanium alloy that makes it suitable for implantation 
ivad received fda approval for btt and recovery post cardiotomy in august in june  the ivad received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
discontinued operations international technidyne corporation on november   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  international technidyne corporation itc  to itc nexus holding company  inc nexus for million in cash pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  dated as of november   by and between the company and nexus 
for the period ended december   we recorded net loss of million less tax benefit of million for itc primarily related to post close severance payments 
the itc division has been reclassified to discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  long lived asset impairments  warranty provisions  contingent consideration  income taxes  and share based compensation  are updated as appropriate  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales to customers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or service has been performed  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured and there are no further obligations to customers 
delivery of the product is considered to have occurred when shipped 
sales from products are not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
we sell products through our direct sales force and through distributors 
sales through distributors are recognized as revenue upon sale to the distributor as these sales are considered to be final and no right of return or price protection exists 
we recognize sales of certain products to first time customers when it has been determined that the customer has the ability to use the products 
reserves on accounts receivable  inventory and warranty we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is management best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on specific identification and historical write off experience 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 

table of contents estimated excess and obsolete inventory charges are recorded when inventory levels exceed projected sales volume 
in determining the excess obsolete charges  management makes judgments and estimates on matters such as forecasted sales volume 
actual sales volume may differ from forecasted sales volume and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 
based on management estimate  adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess or obsolete inventory 
the sales of our products generally include a limited one year warranty on product quality 
the estimated cost of product warranty claims is accrued at the time the sale is recognized  based on historical experience 
while we believe that historical experience provides a reliable basis for estimating such warranty cost  unforeseen quality issues or component failure rates could result in future costs in excess of such estimates  or alternatively  improved quality and reliability in our products could result in actual expenses that are below those currently estimated 
long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets  whenever events  changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate 
if these facts and circumstances exist  we assess for recovery by comparing the carrying values of long lived assets with their future undiscounted net cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that impairment exists  long lived assets are written down to their respective fair value based on discounted cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows 
product sales from our pvad and ivad product lines  collectively known as the thoratec product line  were million and million in fiscals and  respectively  and significantly declined to million in fiscal as a result of recent changes in the market in which these products compete 
accordingly  we assessed for recovery the associated purchased intangible assets with their future undiscounted net cash flows in the fourth quarter of the comparison resulted in the existence of impairment  and accordingly the purchased intangible assets were written down to the fair value totaling million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists  and it involves comparing the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
goodwill is considered impaired  and an impairment charge is recorded  if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying value of goodwill 
contingent consideration on august   we acquired of levitronix medical for an upfront cash payment of million  plus additional cash earn out amounts not to exceed million in aggregate 
the earn out contingent consideration is calculated based on of sales from levitronix medical in excess of sales of approximately million per year over the next four years commencing from the date of acquisition 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is calculated using the income approach  utilizing various revenue assumptions and applying a probability to each outcome 
by applying this method  the estimated undiscounted range of outcomes was from million to million 
the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was estimated and recorded at million 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at the estimated fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded within operating expense within our consolidated statements of operations 
actual amounts paid may differ from the obligations recorded 
in  we paid million of the contingent consideration 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was million 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax laws that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions 
this process involves our estimate of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents we account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes  which require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
these accounting standards also require that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on accounting standards that prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as a result  we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two step process prescribed in the standards 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  settlement of issues under audit  and new exposures 
if we later determine that the exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we will adjust the liability and effect a related change in tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
valuation of share based awards we account for share based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for share based compensation  which requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
the fair value of each option on the date of grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model using the single option approach 
we recognize the expense ratably on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  therefore  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
in addition  expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility trends and market based implied volatility 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
in addition  if we employ different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard  the compensation expense that we record in the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
fair value of financial instruments we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on valuation techniques using the best information available  which may include quoted market prices  market comparables and discounted cash flow projections 
financial instruments are primarily comprised of money market funds  certificate of deposits  municipal and corporate bonds  commercial paper  variable demand notes  auction rate securities  derivative contracts  certain investments held as assets under the deferred compensation plan  and marketable equity securities 
cash equivalents and investments in general  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
if quoted prices for identical or similar assets are not available  we use internally developed valuation models  whose inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data 
derivative instruments we hold non speculative foreign currency forwards to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
we use internally developed valuation models that project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using significant market based observable inputs including interest rate curves  foreign exchange rates  and forward and spot prices for currencies

the heartmate units grew contributing million to the increase  primarily driven by destination therapy patient implants  which accounted for approximately of our us volume 
centrimag and pedimag product lines contributed million to the increase  primarily attributable to the incremental revenues of million related to the levitronix medical acquisition 
the increase was partially offset by a significant decline of million in sales of the thoratec product line 
from a regional perspective  us sales contributed approximately million to the increase  while international sales contributed approximately million 
in the us  heartmate ii centers were added during bringing the total to centers 
internationally  we added centers in  bringing the total to centers 

table of contents in as compared to  product sales increased million  or  driven by strong sales volume of heartmate and centrimag products 
the heartmate product line contributed approximately million to the increase  while centrimag contributed approximately million  partially attributable to the levitronix medical acquisition completed in august  which added million from the date of the acquisition through december  the increase was partially offset by a decline of approximately million in sales of the thoratec product line 
the remaining million decrease was due to decline of other products 
from a regional perspective  us sales contributed approximately million to the increase  while international sales contributed approximately million

internationally  we added centers in  bringing the total to centers 
sales originating outside of the us and us export sales accounted for approximately  and of our total product sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit fiscal years in thousands  except percentages total gross profit total gross margin in as compared to  the gross margin decreased percentage points due to the impairment recorded in related to pvad and ivad intangible assets 
product sales from our pvad and ivad product lines  collectively known as the thoratec product line were million and million in fiscals and  respectively  and significantly declined to million in fiscal as a result of recent changes in the market in which these products compete 
accordingly  we assessed for recovery the associated purchased intangible assets with their future undiscounted net cash flows in the fourth quarter of the comparison resulted in the existence of impairment  and accordingly the purchased intangible assets were written down to the fair value totaling million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
this was in part offset by a percentage point increase in gross margin due to volume based efficiencies  favorable product mix  and the contribution from the acquisition of levitronix medical in august in as compared to  the gross margin increased percentage points primarily due to favorable pump to non pump mix  favorable foreign exchange rate changes  volume based effectiveness  lower inventory write downs  and lower warranty expenses in  which were partially offset by the fair value inventory adjustment related to the levitronix medical acquisition 
selling  general and administrative fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands  except percentages total selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of product sales were approximately   and in   and  respectively 
in as compared to  sg a costs increased by primarily related to spending on market and referral development initiatives that include sales force expansion  and higher incentive and stock based compensation costs 
this was partially offset by transaction costs recorded in related to the levitronix acquisition 
in as compared to  sg a costs increased by primarily due to market development initiatives including sales force expansion  increased travel and other selling expenses  which were attributed to the higher product sales  and intangible assets amortization in connection with the acquisition of levitronix medical in august levitronix medical acquisition related transaction costs of million also contributed to the increase in over the prior year 

table of contents research and development fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands  except percentages total research and development expenses research and development r d expenses as a percentage of product sales were approximately   and in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
in as compared to  r d expenses increased by primarily due to an increase in headcount and costs associated with the development of our fully implantable systems  heartmate iii  php  and heartmate ii peripheral enhancements  as well as hmii post market study costs and higher incentive and stock based compensation costs 
in as compared to  r d expenses increased by due to next generation product development costs for heartmate x  heartmate iii  php  heartmate ii peripheral enhancements  and incremental r d activities in connection with the levitronix medical acquisition

table of contents interest income decreased by million in from primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances in  combined with lower interest rates and yields on the investments 
interest income decreased by million in from primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  combined with lower interest rates and yields on the investments 
the lower cash  cash equivalents and investment balances were due to the use of million in cash during to extinguish the senior subordinated convertible notes  acquire levitronix medical for million  and the repurchase of approximately million of common stock in impairment on investment in we recorded an impairment charge of million for our entire investment in acorn cardiovascular  inc  a start up medical device company 
the impairment charge was included in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in the annual effective tax rate of percentage points was primarily due to the higher proportionate impact of permanent differences as a result of lower pre tax income and a greater percentage of earnings generated in lower tax jurisdictions 
the effect of these factors was partially offset by the delay in the passage of the american taxpayer relief act of  which prevented us from recognizing federal research and development credit benefits in on january   the president signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of the taxpayer relief act extends the research tax credit for two years to december  the extension of the research tax credit is retroactive and includes amounts paid or incurred after december  as a result of the enactment after the company year end  we expect to recognize a benefit of approximately million for qualifying amounts incurred in the benefit will be recognized in the period of enactment  which is the first quarter of our effective tax rate was in compared to in this decrease in the annual effective tax rate of percentage points was primarily due to a one time reversal of tax reserves related to california research and development credit  valuation allowance recorded in  and favorable return to provision adjustments 
the effect of these factors was partially offset by lower tax exempt income and the write off of certain us deferred tax assets in discontinued operations we incurred a loss of million in from discontinued operations as compared to a loss of million during during we recorded a charge of million million net loss  less an income tax benefit of million for itc primarily related to post close severance payments 
in addition  we recorded a loss from the sale of itc of million in the period

these non cash contributions were partially offset by the decrease from excess tax benefits from share based compensation of million and the decrease of million in our net deferred tax liability primarily related to the impairment of the purchased intangible assets discussed above 
changes in assets and liabilities provided additional cash of million primarily due to the increase in accounts payable due to higher volume and higher incentive compensation as well as a decrease in inventory  offset by an increase in account receivables in the current year 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million consisting primarily of net income from continuing operations of million and adjustments for non cash expenses relating to depreciation and amortization  including the amortization of intangible assets obtained from the levitronix medical acquisition 
in addition  million of non cash interest expense and other  million related to share based compensation expenses  million of tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
these non cash contributions were partially offset by a decrease of million related to excess tax benefits from share based compensation and a decrease of million in our net deferred tax liability 
changes in assets and liabilities used additional cash of million primarily due to the increase in inventory in anticipation of higher product sales  offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets  accounts payable due to timing of payments  accrued liabilities from the reduction in variable compensation related accrual  and lower income tax payable in the current year 

table of contents cash used in provided by investing activities in  cash used in investing activities was million  as net sales and maturity of investments of million  partially offset by the purchase of investments of million  the use of million for an acquisition of a business and million for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment  related to leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and equipment purchases to support our manufacturing facilities and administration growth 
in  cash provided by investing activities was million  as net sales and maturity of investments of million were partially offset by the purchase of investments of million  million cash payment to acquire levitronix medical  and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment  related to leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and equipment purchases to support our manufacturing facilities and administration growth 
cash used in financing activities in  cash used in financing activities was million  which was primarily comprised of million used for repurchases of million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase programs authorized  million used to repurchase vested restricted stock units and awards for settlement of income tax withholding liabilities  and the payment of contingent consideration of million 
these uses were partially offset by proceeds of million related to stock option exercises  million proceeds from stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan  and million from excess tax benefits for share based compensation 
in  cash used in financing activities was million  which was primarily comprised of million used to extinguish the senior subordinated convertible notes  million used for repurchases of million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized  and million used to repurchase vested restricted stock units and awards for settlement of income tax withholding liabilities 
these uses were partially offset by proceeds of million related to stock option exercises  million proceeds from stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan  and million from excess tax benefits for share based compensation 
stock repurchase program on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company shares of common stock 
as part of the authorization  the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with jp morgan  under which we agreed to repurchase an aggregate of million of our common stock 
under the asr program  we paid million and received an initial delivery of approximately million shares  which represented of the asr program value at a price of per share at the inception of the program 
shares representing the remaining of the asr program value will be delivered at maturity date of the program  which can be up to months from the inception of the program  with the final number of shares to be repurchased based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the repurchase period  less an agreed upon discount and adjusted for the initial share delivery 
under the terms of the asr program  at settlement  we could either receive additional shares from the counterparty or be required to deliver additional shares or cash  at our option  to the counterparty 
the total number of shares ultimately repurchased will not be known until the calculation period ends and a final settlement occurs 
as of december   million is available for repurchases of shares of our common stock under the november program 
the asr program was accounted for as two separate transactions i as shares of common stock acquired in a share repurchase transaction and ii as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock 
the initial delivery of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted net earnings per share from the effective date of the asr program 
we have determined that the forward contract indexed to our common stock met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification 

table of contents on november  we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million worth of shares of our common stock 
additionally  the board of directors extended the expiration date for the million remaining under the million share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on february  program february program to november  during  under this program and the november program  we paid an additional million to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
in each case  the repurchase of shares of our common stock under these programs has reduced the number of shares of our common stock 
as of december   both of these programs had expired 
off balance sheet arrangements letter of credit we maintain an irrevocable standby letter of credit as part of our workers compensation insurance program 
the letter of credit is not collateralized and automatically renews for a month period on june th of each year  unless terminated by one of the parties 
as of december   our letter of credit balance was approximately million 
credit facility on december   we obtained an unsecured revolving credit facility that provides for up to million revolving credit that will expire on december  the interest rate charged on the amounts borrowed is libor plus a margin ranging from to 
the agreement contains financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  the credit agreement permits us to use the facility for working capital and general corporate purposes 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the revolver 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations total thereafter in millions operating lease obligations a deferred compensation obligations b purchase obligations c total a our operating lease obligations of million are comprised primarily of our various us and switzerland leased facilities 
b our deferred compensation obligations of million are comprised of future distributions to plan participants 
c our purchase obligations include million for open purchase orders and million of supply agreements in effect at december  as of december   the liability for uncertain tax positions was million including interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio and cash equivalents that bear variable interest would have an immaterial impact to interest income  on the consolidated statements of operations  if interest rates would have fallen by basis points 
in addition  if interest rates rise  the market value of our investment portfolio may decline  which could result in a loss if we choose or are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
if interest rates were to rise or fall from current levels by basis points  the change in our net unrealized loss on our short and long term investments would be million 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 

table of contents foreign currency rate fluctuations the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates and is estimated based on the amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contract  taking into account the change in currency exchange rates 
a change in the non functional currency exchange rates as of december  related to our contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized gain or loss on forward currency exchange contracts of million 
the unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the currency exposures resulting from our operations
