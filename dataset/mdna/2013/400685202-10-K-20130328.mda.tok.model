corporate background the company operates its business through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary  guanwei  which is located in fuqing city  fujian province  prc 
guanwei imports and recycles low density polyethylene ldpe plastic scrap material into granular plastic for use in the manufacture of various consumer products  and is one of the largest manufacturers of recycled ldpe in china 
guanwei is one of the few plastic recyclers in china to import most of its raw materials ie plastic waste from foreign suppliers primarily germany where the cost of processing plastic waste is significantly higher than in china 
guanwei s products are sold to customers in a wide range of industries  including shoe manufacturing  architecture and engineering products  industrial equipment and supplies and chemical and petrochemical manufacturing 
the company is organized as a single business segment and is committed to sourcing and developing innovative ideas and markets for recycled materials  and concentrates on transforming plastic waste into useful plastic grains 
its mission is to be an environmentally conscious  profitable manufacturer of plastics products of the highest quality 
guanwei procures raw material in the form of plastic waste from its suppliers and uses this material to manufacture recycled plastic grains  which are then sold to manufacturers of consumer products in various industries 
guanwei specializes in the production of various recycled plastics products  the most important of which is ldpe 
guanwei has developed four distinct grades of ldpe plastic grains  which are sold to customers to be manufactured into a broad range of end products 
guanwei currently sells to more than customers  including over active recurring customers during  in over industries  ranging from shoe manufacturing  architecture and engineering  industrial equipment and supplies  and chemical and petrochemical manufacturing 
guanwei s ldpe products in particular are widely used in the manufacturing of chemical and functional fibers  and is the main raw material for shoe soles  insulation material  fire proofing and water proofing material  and foam 
guanwei operates its business in compliance with the highest environmental standards in order to meet the stringent requirements of both german and chinese authorities 
in fact  on june   umweltagentur erftstadt  a provider of certification services  issued its audit report on the compliance of guanwei operations with german regulations regarding pollution and environmental controls 
based upon its audit  umweltagentur erftstadt determined to issue a certificate to guanwei as to such compliance 
holding such a compliance certificate permits a plastics recycler to purchase plastic waste directly from german suppliers 
the company s corporate offices are located at rong qiao economic zone  fuqing city  fujian province  people s republic of china  our telephone number is current business and recent developments our revenues are derived from the sale of recycled ldpe and non ldpe waste materials 
we manufacture recycled ldpe from plastic waste and occasionally purchase recycled ldpe from other manufacturers for resale when market conditions justify us doing so 
the raw materials ie plastic waste we use in our operations generally contain approximately of non ldpe plastic waste  such as polyethylene terephthalate  polypropylene  or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 
we sort and classify this non ldpe material and sell it to other recycled plastic manufacturers that use these products 
in  we made significant improvements in our factory equipment and facility 
our capacity increased to annual production of  tons as a result of these improvements 
in  we acquired additional factory equipment to improve our production efficiency 
we also built additional storage space of  square meters for our raw materials which will allow us to better manage our production cycle to meet our customers orders 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions accounting principles our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements  and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial reporting period 
the most significant estimates and assumptions include revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  useful lives of property and equipment  and valuation allowance of deferred taxes 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
we believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in this annual report reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates 
the following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements a revenue recognition revenue from sales of manufactured ldpe is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the goods has occurred  and customer acceptance has been obtained  which means the significant risks and ownership have been transferred to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
from time to time  revenue is deferred for upfront payments for sales of recycled ldpe received and is included in accrued expenses and other payables until the significant risks and ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customers and the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales of non ldpe waste materials and sales of raw materials are recognized on the same basis as sales of ldpe 
b inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in first out method  or market value 
costs include purchase and related costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition 
market value is calculated based on the estimated normal selling price  less further costs expected to be incurred for disposal 
provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving or defective items  where appropriate 
we estimate the net realizable value for such finished goods and work in progress based primarily upon the latest invoice prices and current market conditions 
if the market value of an inventory drops below its carrying value  we record a write off to cost of sales for the difference between the carrying cost and the market value 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded no inventory write down 
we carry out an inventory review at each reporting period 
c income taxes in the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the registrant and its subsidiaries  with the exception of guanwei  generated no taxable income 
current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income tax purposes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards and credits by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we conduct this analysis on a quarterly basis 
as of december   the company has undistributed profits of approximately  that are subject to withholding tax when distributed 
since the company intends to reinvest these undistributed profits to further expand its businesses and does not intend to declare dividends  the company has not recorded a withholding tax in relation to these undistributed profits 
should the company s distribute all these profits  the aggregate withholding tax will amount to approximately  which assumes the current tax rate of the undistributed earnings prepared under prc gaap after the company has no material uncertain tax positions as of december  or unrecognized tax benefit which would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
the company classifies interest and or penalties related to income tax matters as an income tax expense 
as of december   there is no interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
d new accounting standards recently adopted accounting standards in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 topic fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
the amendments establish common requirements for measuring fair value and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates and international financial reporting standards

 topic comprehensive income deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu asu to defer the effective date of the provision requiring entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
however  the remaining requirements of asu became effective for the first interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 topic intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment asu  which amends current guidance to allow a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test

asu became effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 topic balance sheet disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
asu requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position

the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  which amends the guidance in asc on testing indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment 
fasb issued asu in response to feedback on asu  which amended the goodwill impairment testing requirements by allowing an entity to perform a qualitative impairment assessment before proceeding to the two step impairment test 
similarly  under asu  an entity testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset 
if the entity determines  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is not more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than percent impaired  the entity would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset 
asu does not revise the requirement to test indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment 
in addition  the asu does not amend the requirement to test these assets for impairment between annual tests if there is a change in events or circumstances  however  it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider in interim periods

results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  the following table sets forth a summary of certain key components of our results of operations for the years indicated  in usd 
for the years ended december  change in net revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense net foreign exchange gain loss on disposal of property and equipment miscellaneous income taxes net income revenues the following table sets forth a summary of our net revenue by categories for the periods indicated  in usd 
for the years ended december  change in sales of recycled ldpe sales of sorted non ldpe materials sales of raw materials our revenues are derived from the sales of recycled ldpe and non ldpe waste materials 
we manufacture recycled ldpe from plastic waste and occasionally sell our raw materials when we have excess raw materials and the market conditions justify doing so 
we have approximately to of loss of materials during our production process 
the raw materials ie plastic waste we use in our operations generally contain approximately of non ldpe plastic waste  such as polyethylene terephthalate  polypropylene  or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 
we sort and classify this non ldpe material and sell it to other recycled plastic manufacturers who use these products 
revenue generated during the fiscal year from the sale of manufactured recycled ldpe was  as compared to  for  which represents an increase of 
this increase was due to an increase in both sales volume and selling price of manufactured recycled ldpe 
the company sold  tons of manufactured recycled ldpe in the year ended december   representing an increase of from the  tons sold in the average selling price of recycled ldpe increased from approximately  per ton in to approximately  per ton in we sold  tons of raw materials in the amount of  during the year ended december  in order to get a volume discount from our suppliers  we verbally agreed to purchase certain quantities in order to continue get our raw materials at lower prices 
raw materials in excess of our production needs were sold at a small profit in order to free up our storage space 
we did not sell any raw materials during the same period of revenue generated from the sales of sorted non ldpe material increased from  in to  in  representing an increase of 
this was due to an increase in both sales volume and selling price 
guanwei sold  tons of sorted non ldpe material in  representing an increase of from  tons sold in the same period of a higher volume of non ldpe material was sold during the fiscal year because our production of ldpe material increased 
since non ldpe material is a by product of manufacturing our ldpe products  the increase of our sales of non ldpe material is in line with the increase of our ldpe product sales 
the average selling price of sorted non ldpe material increased to approximately per ton in from approximately per ton in as with recycled ldpe  the average selling price of sorted non ldpe materials has increased steadily since the first quarter of our revenue may be affected by the import quotas granted by the prc s ministry of environmental protection 
on july   guanwei received official government approval for expansion of its quota for imported plastic waste 
pursuant to the approval  the guanwei s import quota increased from  tons to  tons in we have been approved for an import quota of  tons and  tons of plastic waste in and  respectively 
guanwei entered into an agreement  dated november   pursuant to which guanwei has been permitted to use  at no cost  the  tons per year import quota granted to fuqing huan li plastics company limited huan li for a term of years 
min chen  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  is also the chief executive officer  chairman of the board and legal representative of huan li 
huan li s import quota was reduced to  for the year of accordingly  we are only allowed to use huan li s quota up to  tons of imported plastic waste 
there can be no guarantee that huan li s import quota will be available to us after the expiration of the agreement 
if we are unable to use huan li s import quota or obtain the grant of an import quota from the ministry of environment protection  our revenue and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
please refer to the section entitled risk factors in our annual report on form k for further information and other factors that may affect our revenue 
together with the import quota of  tons contracted from huan li  the company had a total import quota of  tons in other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report  we are unaware of any trends or uncertainties which have or which we reasonably expect to have a material impact on net sales or revenues from continued operations 
cost of revenue year ended december  year ended december  in of net revenue in of net revenue change in cost of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe materials cost of raw material sales during the years ended december  and  our cost of revenue was  and  representing and of net revenue  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  our cost of revenue from sales of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material was  and  representing and of net revenue from sales of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material 
the increase in the percentage of cost to net revenue is primarily due to manufacturing costs increased at a faster pace than the increase in our selling price 
raw material prices increased  from per ton in to per ton in  while the average selling prices of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material increased and  respectively  from  per ton and per ton in to  per ton and per ton in in order to cut costs and increase profit margins  guanwei focuses heavily on developing relationships with new suppliers and increasing the amount of high quality raw material purchased directly from european suppliers  as opposed to purchasing from a wholesaler 
guanwei will continue to work on developing such relationships  and obtaining more favorable terms and discounts by strengthening our relationship with suppliers and placing more bulk orders 
gross profit during the fiscal year  we were able to achieve price increases throughout the year 
there also were indications of stabilization in some of our key costs in the second half of the year  in particular  for raw materials  where cost increases were relatively moderate in comparison with prior periods 
nevertheless  our overall gross profit for decreased to  compared to  for during the fiscal year  our overall gross profit margin decreased to from in the percent points decrease in overall gross profit margin was attributable to our raw material cost increasing at a faster rate than the increase in our selling price of recycled ldpe and overall increases in direct labor and overhead cost 
in addition  we sold certain raw materials with an average gross profit margin of in we did not sell any raw materials in gross profit from sales of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material during decreased by  to  or of net revenue  from  or for the decrease in gross profit was primarily the effect of increases in selling price and sales volume which were not sufficient to cover the increase of raw material  direct labor and overhead cost 
during  we continued to experience increases in manufacturing cost 
during  the sales volume of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material increased and  respectively  and their average selling prices increased and  respectively 
the average per ton manufacturing cost of recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material during continued to climb at a faster pace than the increase in our selling prices 
gross profit from sales of raw materials during was  or of net revenue from sales of raw materials 
we did not have such revenue in the prices of imported plastic waste are determined solely by suppliers and are dependent upon market conditions  and the import related costs are mainly dependent on the delivery terms agreed with suppliers 
in order to reduce costs and to secure availability of raw material  the company intends to continue to work on obtaining more favorable terms and a sustainable supply of materials by strengthening our relationships with suppliers and by developing long term supply arrangements 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of transportation and courier costs and payroll and related benefits 
in  sales and marketing expenses increased to  compared to  for the increase was primarily caused by the increase in payroll and related benefit costs 
our payroll cost increased to  in from  in sales and marketing expenses also include our delivery cost which is primarily affected by gasoline prices 
our customers may choose to either pick up their products with their own vehicles or to have the company arrange delivery  in which case the transportation costs are categorized as selling and marketing expenses 
our delivery cost for is not materially different from that for the company believes delivery cost will fluctuate due to the fluctuation of gasoline prices and our sales volume 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of management remuneration  depreciation and amortization  employee welfare costs  and legal and professional fees 
during  general and administrative expenses increased to  compared to  in this increase was primarily due to the following the increase in pension contributions to  for from  for  an increase of  or  due to increased mandatory coverage imposed by the government  the increase in employee insurance and welfare expense to  from  for  an increase of  or  due to implementation of mandatory medical insurance coverage beginning in november  and the increase in travel and entertainment expense to  for from  for  an increase of  or 
other income expenses our interest income is generated by interest earned on deposits with banks and financial institutions and interest expenses are amounts we pay in interest with respect to our borrowings 
the decrease in interest income of  to  for from  for  is due to lower interest rates on bank savings 
interest expenses decreased as a result of borrowings paid off in the first quarter of therefore  we did not incur any interest expenses in net foreign exchange gain decreased  to  for from  for since a majority of our raw materials from europe are settled in usd or euro  foreign exchange gain loss will be affected by currency exchange fluctuation between usd and euro and rmb 
loss on disposal of property and equipment was primarily related to disposing certain factory equipment which was replaced by new machinery and equipment 
we intend to continue to acquire new machinery and equipment to improve our production efficiency 
we support our operations through a combination of self generated profit and limited amount of loans from banks and financial institutions 
as of december  and  we did not have any outstanding borrowings as we have sufficient working capital to meet our short term cash needs 
net income during the fiscal year of  while there were indications of a stabilization in some key costs in the second half of the year  the increases in our manufacturing costs for the full year outpaced our average selling prices 
during the year ended december   our net income decreased to  as compared to  for we continued to see growth in our average selling prices for our products and sales volume 
however due to the increases of our manufacturing costs which outpaced our average selling prices  our net profit dropped slightly during the year ended december  if we see further strengthening of the chinese economy in  as many are predicting  we believe we should continue to be able to realize improvements in tonnage sales and pricing 
in order to continue to improve gross margin and net profit margin  we intend to focus on enhancing our manufacturing techniques and improving our labor efficiency 
additionally  we will continue to strengthen our relationships with our major suppliers to obtain more favorable terms  and we will enhance management control over general and administrative expenses 
inflation inflationary factors  such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs  may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
foreign exchange a majority of our net revenue and expenditures are denominated in the renminbi 
however  the price of raw materials that we buy from foreign suppliers is primarily denominated in the us dollar and european union euro 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the european union euro or the us dollar and the renminbi will affect the cost of such raw materials to us and will affect our results of operations and financial condition 
substantially all of our purchases for the fiscal year ended december  were denominated in the us dollar and the european union euro 
accordingly any significant movements in the exchange rate between the us dollar or european union euro and the renminbi will have a significant impact on our operating income 
the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar is subject to the prc government s foreign currency conversion policies  which may change at any time 
the exchange rates at december  and were approximately and renminbi to us dollar  respectively 
any devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar would consequently have an adverse effect on our financial performance and asset values when measured in terms of us dollars 
we recognized a foreign currency translation gain in other comprehensive income of approximately  and  for the fiscal years ended december  and if the exchange rate were to increase by to us rmb at december   our foreign currency translation gain in other comprehensive income would potentially decrease by approximately  for the year ended december  if the exchange rate were to decrease by to us rmb at december   our foreign currency translation gain in other comprehensive income would potentially increase by approximately  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we generally finance our operations through operating profit and through short term borrowings from banks and financial institutions 
as of the date of this annual report  we have not experienced any difficulties due to a shortage of capital or in raising funds through loans from banks and financial institutions  and we have not had any liquidity problems in settling our payables in the normal course of business and repaying our loans when they come due 
we are unaware of any trends  demands  commitments events or uncertainties that will result or be likely to result in material changes in our liquidity 
we believe that the level of financial resources is a significant factor for our future development and  accordingly  we may determine from time to time to raise capital through private debt or equity financing to strengthen the company s financial position  to expand our facilities and to provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising such additional capital on terms acceptable to us 
the following table sets forth the summary of our cash flows  in usd  for the fiscal years ended december  and years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year operating activities during the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of  as compared to  for during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of  which was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable of  because we continued to extend credits to more customers with good credit history and customers we have a long history of doing business with  an increase in inventories of  because we expected a strong sales month in january  an increase in advances from suppliers of  and a decrease in accounts payable of  was due to new arrangements with suppliers about advances for raw materials 
our customers paid slower during as a result of general economy slowdown 
we will continue monitor our accounts receivable and our customers financial conditions to avoid any bad debt loss 
through december   we have not suffered any material amounts of bad debt 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of  and an increase in accounts payable of  due to the increase of inventory purchases which were partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable of  due to a new credit policy established to extend credit to customers in and increase in inventories of  due to increased revenues in investing activities during the fiscal year ended december  and  net cash used in investing activities was  and  respectively 
we incurred capital expenditures of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures were primarily related to the building improvements and other factory equipment purchases 
we incur capital expenditure as needed in order to improve our facility and add new equipment or to replace existing equipment in order to improve our production process and efficiency 
during the fiscal year ended december   we sold certain equipment for cash proceeds of  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was  representing an increase of  compared to  net cash used in financing activities in we received loans from a shareholder in the amount of  to pay certain professional fees during the year ended december  we repaid short term borrowings of  which was partially offset by the release of restricted cash in the amount of  as a result of the repayment of our short term borrowings and we received loans from a shareholder of  to pay certain professional fees during the year ended december  working capital our working capital as of december  was  compared to working capital of  as of december   representing an increase of  or 
the improved working capital during the year ended december  was mainly due to the net operating cash flows generated from the increases in our net income and conversion of debt through issuance of common stock 
we expect to use our working capital to expand the growth of our business including adding new machinery and equipment and improving our production facility in order to increase our production efficiency 
at december   we believe we would have sufficient working capital to fund our operations in the next twelve months 
we aim to continue to improve the level of working capital through the enhanced level of productivity and increased revenue and efficiently controlling costs 
dividends we are a holding company with no material operations of our own 
we conduct our operations primarily through our prc operating subsidiary in china 
as a result  our ability to pay dividends and to finance any debt we may incur depends upon dividends paid by our prc operating subsidiary 
if our prc subsidiary or any newly formed subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future  the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us 
in addition  our prc operating subsidiary is permitted to pay dividends to us only out of its retained earnings  if any  as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations 
under prc laws and regulations  our prc operating subsidiary is required to allocate at least of its after tax profits each year  if any  to prc statutory reserves before distributing dividends until the balance of such fund has reached of its registered capital 
our prc operating subsidiary with foreign investment is also required to further set aside a portion of its after tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund at the discretion of the board 
although the prc statutory reserves can be used  among other ways  to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the prc operating subsidiary  the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation of the prc operating subsidiary 
foreign cash as of december  and  the company had cash deposits of million and million placed with several banks and a financial institution in the people s republic of china  where there is currently no rule or regulation in place for obligatory insurance of accounts with banks and financial institutions 
if the foreign cash and cash equivalents are expatriated to finance any needs of our operations in the us  we may need to accrue and pay us taxes 
currently  we have not provided for us income and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of our prc operating subsidiary since we intend to reinvest our earnings to further expand our businesses in mainland china and do not intend to declare dividends to our us holding company in the foreseeable future 
trend information other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report  we are not aware of any trends  uncertainties  demands  commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our revenues  income  profitability  liquidity or capital resources  or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments  off balance sheet guarantees or interest rate swap transactions of foreign currency forward contracts 
furthermore  we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity
