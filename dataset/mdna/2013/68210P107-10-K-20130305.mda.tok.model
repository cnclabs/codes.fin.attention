company overview business 
the company operates through two industry segments animal nutrition and human nutrition 
the animal nutrition segment is comprised primarily of two subsidiaries omega protein  inc omega protein and omega shipyard  inc omega shipyard 
omega protein  which is the company s principal operating subsidiary  is predominantly dedicated to the production of animal nutrition products and operates in the menhaden harvesting and processing business and is the successor to a business conducted since a portion of omega protein s production is transferred to the human nutrition segment where it is further processed and sold 
omega shipyard owns and operates a drydock facility in moss point  mississippi that is used to provide shoreside maintenance for omega protein s fishing fleet and  subject to outside demand and excess capacity  occasionally for third party vessels 
the human nutrition segment is comprised primarily by two subsidiaries cyvex nutrition  inc cyvex and incon processing  llc incon 
cyvex  founded in and acquired by the company in december  is located in irvine  california and is an ingredient provider in the nutraceutical industry 
incon  acquired by the company in september  is located in batavia  illinois and is a specialty toll processor that utilizes molecular distillation technology to concentrate a variety of compound products  including omega fish oils 
the company also has a number of other immaterial direct and indirect subsidiaries 
fishing and production 
omega protein is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
omega protein products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
omega protein s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
omega protein crude fish oil is sold to food producers and feed manufacturers  and its refined fish oil products are used in food production  feed production  certain industrial applications as well as dietary supplements 
fish solubles are sold as attractants for animal feeds and baits and as fertilizers 
omega protein s harvesting season generally extends from early may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from mid april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  omega protein fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season or in some cases  by re selling meal and oil purchased from other suppliers 
the fish catch is processed into three general types of products  fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles at omega protein s four meal and oil processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia 
during  omega protein experienced abnormally below average fish catch in the gulf of mexico from the months of june to september as a result of the gulf of mexico oil spill 
the gulf of mexico below average fish catch was partially mitigated by an above average fish catch in the atlantic for the fishing season and an above average fish catch in the gulf of mexico for the month of october  once the majority of the fishing restrictions were lifted as a result of the gulf of mexico oil spill and fishing conditions returned to normal 
the overall decrease in fish catch negatively impacted omega protein s inventory available to sell during the second half of and its per unit product costs 
the high per unit product costs were partially offset by million in emergency payments from the gulf coast claims facility gccf which were received during see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the gulf of mexico oil spill 
in  omega protein experienced its highest fish catch since and its highest overall production since the increased level of production contributed to the highest revenues and overall cost of production in the company s history 
low fish oil yields  which were below the company s five year oil yield average  offset some of the positive fish catch impact  resulting in higher per unit product costs 
per unit product costs increased and as compared to and per unit product costs  respectively 
the higher unit product cost inventories from the fishing season were largely sold by june  the company s oil yield results were the poorest in its recent history 
for illustrative purposes  the company s oil yields for were lower by compared to and were lower by compared to the company s five year oil yield average 
total yields in decreased by compared to those in and were lower by compared to the company s five year total yield average  due primarily to the lower fish oil yields 
the company believes that fish yields are influenced by multiple factors  including but not limited to  fish diet  weather  water temperature  fish population and age of fish  but such possible relationships and inter relationships are not generally well understood 
the impact of these poor oil yields has resulted in significantly higher per unit inventory cost and fewer volumes available for future sale 
these higher unit costs and fewer volumes available for sale have adversely impacted financial results for the second  third and fourth quarters of and can be expected to adversely affect financial results through the second quarter of the following table summarizes the omega protein s fishing and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch short tons production fish meal short tons oil metric tons crude refined solubles short tons total production omega protein s harvesting and processing business is seasonal and fluctuates from year to year and month to month due to natural conditions over which omega protein has no control 
poor fish catch and total yields have at times materially impacted the amount of products that omega protein has been able to produce 
markets 
pricing for omega protein s products has been volatile in the past several years and is attributable mainly to the international availability  or the perceived international availability  of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  omega protein has implemented a quality control program designed to increase its capability of producing higher quality fish meal products and  in conjunction therewith  enhanced it sales efforts to penetrate premium product markets 
additionally  the company continues to market its refined fish oil to food manufactures and other related industries through the human nutrition segment 
the company has made sales of its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company has also made sales of omegaactiv to human supplement manufacturers 
during  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to the gulf of mexico oil spill  and omega protein expanded its purchase and resale of other fish meals primarily us  panamanian  peruvian  moroccan  and mexican fish meal 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from omega protein s base domestic production  these operations provide omega protein with a source of fish meal to sell into other markets  some of which  omega protein has not historically had a presence 
during the year ended december   omega protein purchased approximately  tons of fish meal  or approximately of fish meal sales volumes for the same period 
the company did not purchase any fish meal or fish oil during or omega protein sells a portion of its products on up to a twelve month forward contract basis with the balance sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
omega protein s sales contracts generally contain force majeure and other production allocation provisions 
during and as a result of the gulf of mexico oil spill  omega protein purchased additional fish meal from a third party to supplement its production and received partial reimbursement from bp through the gccf for additional costs associated with this purchase 
historically  fish meal and fish oil sold on a forward contract basis has fluctuated from year to year based upon perceived market availability and forward price expectations 
as of december   omega protein had sold forward on a contract basis approximately  short tons of fish meal and  metric tons of fish oil for of these forward sales  all of the fish meal sales and approximately half of the fish oil sales were contracted in  the remainder of the fish oil sales were contracted in as a basis of comparison  as of december   omega protein had sold forward on a contract basis approximately  short tons of fish meal and  metric tons of fish oil for omega protein s annual revenues are highly dependent on pricing  annual fish catch  production yields and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to the next year 
omega protein determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on existing contracts  prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
omega protein s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  omega protein attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
omega protein s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and  therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
the following table sets forth the company s revenues by product in millions and the approximate percentage of total revenues represented thereby  for the indicated periods years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent fish meal fish oil refined fish oil fish solubles dietary supplement ingredients other total includes human grade fish oils 
acquisition of incon processing  llc in september  the company acquired incon  a specialty toll processor that designs  pilots  synthesizes and purifies specialty chemical compounds utilizing molecular distillation technology to concentrate a variety of compound products  including omega fish oils 
the company believes that incon s concentration technology will allow it to provide its customers with an enhanced range of omega fish oils in concentrated forms such as ethyl esters and triglycerides 
the concentrated fish oils manufactured by incon are marketed and sold under the company s omegaactiv brand by cyvex 
as consideration for the acquisition of incon  the company paid cash of million  utilizing cash on hand  plus an additional million representing incon s estimated working capital on the closing date 
as part of the equity purchase agreement  the sellers may earn additional amounts based on the annual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  of incon s toll processing and specialty product business during calendar years through the transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires  among other things  that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed from acquisitions be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date
