the company business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable  and independent community bank dedicated to providing value added products and services to our customers 
generally  the company has sought to implement this strategy by emphasizing retail  business  and municipal deposits as its primary source of funds 
these funds are redeployed in locally originated residential first mortgage loans  loans to business enterprises operating in its markets  and  to a lesser extent  in investment securities 
specifically  the company business strategy incorporates the following elements i operating as an independent community oriented financial institution  ii maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  iii emphasizing investment in one to four family residential mortgage loans  loans to small businesses  and investment securities  and iv maintaining a strong retail  business and municipal deposit base 
the company net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its investments in mortgage and other loans  investment securities and other assets  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company net income is also affected by its provision for loan losses  noninterest income  service charges and servicing rights  net gains and losses on sales and redemptions of securities  loans and foreclosed real estate  noninterest expense  employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  data processing costs  and income taxes 
earnings of the company are also affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory authorities 
these events are beyond the control of the company 
in particular  the general level of market interest rates tend to be highly cyclical 
application of critical accounting policies the company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values  and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities  are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses  deferred income taxes  pension obligations  the evaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment  the annual evaluation of the company s goodwill for possible impairment  and the estimation of fair values for accounting and disclosure purposes to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
these areas could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
management performs an annual evaluation of the company s goodwill for possible impairment 
based on the results of the evaluation  management has determined that the carrying value of goodwill is not impaired as of december  the evaluation approach is described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
page 
table of contents the allowance for loan losses represents management estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment on the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the company establishes a specific allowance for all loans identified as being impaired with a balance in excess of  which are on nonaccrual and have been risk rated under the company s risk rating system as substandard  doubtful  or loss 
in addition  an accruing substandard loan could be identified as being impaired 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  less costs to sell 
the majority of the company s impaired loans are collateral dependent 
for all other loans and leases  the company uses the general allocation methodology that establishes an allowance to estimate the probable incurred loss for each risk rating category 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated statement of condition 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in this report 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the future tax consequences 
this is attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating and capital loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the affect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
if current available evidence about the future raises doubt about the likelihood of a deferred tax asset being realized  a valuation allowance is established 
the judgment about the level of future taxable income  including that which is considered capital  is inherently subjective and is reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a valuation allowance of  was maintained at december   as management believes it may not generate sufficient capital gains to offset its capital loss carry forward 
the company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due primarily to non taxable income from investment securities and bank owned life insurance 
pension and post retirement benefit plan liabilities and expenses are based upon actuarial assumptions of future events  including fair value of plan assets  interest rates  and the length of time the company will have to provide those benefits 
the assumptions used by management are discussed in note to the consolidated annual financial statements 
the company carries all of its investments at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax as an adjustment to shareholders equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  except for the credit related portion of debt security impairment losses and other than temporary impairment otti of equity securities  which are charged to earnings 
the company ability to fully realize the value of its investments in various securities  including corporate debt securities  is dependent on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing organization 
in evaluating the debt security portfolio for other than temporary impairment losses  management considers if we intend to sell the security  if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or if the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
in determining whether otti has occurred for equity securities  the company considers the applicable factors described above and the length of time the equity security s fair value has been below the carrying amount 
management continually analyzes the portfolio to determine if further impairment has occurred that may be deemed as other than temporary 
further charges are possible depending on future economic conditions 
page 
table of contents the estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets  including investment securities available for sale  the interest rate derivative  intangible assets  foreclosed real estate  and the value of loan collateral when valuing loans 
these are all recorded at either fair value  or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values on our available for sale securities may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
fair values for securities available for sale are obtained from an independent third party pricing service 
where available  fair values are based on quoted prices on a nationally recognized securities exchange 
if quoted prices are not available  fair values are measured using quoted market prices for similar benchmark securities 
management made no adjustments to the fair value quotes that were provided by the pricing source 
the fair values of foreclosed real estate and the underlying collateral value of impaired loans are typically determined based on evaluations by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
when necessary  appraisals are updated to reflect changes in market conditions 
executive summary and results of operations earnings performance metrics for were generally improved over those reported for as net income and return on assets increased 
net income for was million  a  increase from and return on average assets and return on average equity were and  respectively  as compared to and in net interest income increased  in as compared to due to an increase in earning assets and a reduction in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

total assets increased million to  partially funded by deposits which grew by million during primarily as a result of increases in money market deposit accounts and cdars deposits 
both product increases were in support of the company s strategy to accommodate the funding needs of the loan growth that was expected in its marketplace through as such  the loan portfolio represented a greater proportion of the increase in assets with a smaller proportion of the increase within the investment securities portfolio 
the loan portfolio recorded a year over year increase of million to million at december  whereas the investment securities portfolio recorded an increase of million to million at december  the company will continue to emphasize its focus in the cicero  central square  and fulton markets where it feels further market penetration opportunities exist 
additionally  we will pursue expanding commercial deposit relationships with our existing lending customers as well as expanding our commercial loan growth in the greater syracuse market 
asset quality continues to remain stable as net loan charge offs as a percentage of total loans for were  significantly less than the recorded in net charge offs for were  as compared to  in and  in management continues to adhere to conservative underwriting policies and works closely with borrowers who have experienced difficulty in this uncertain economic climate to mitigate loss to the bank

net interest income net interest income is the company primary source of operating income for payment of operating expenses and providing for possible loan losses 
it is the amount by which interest earned on interest earning deposits  loans and investment securities exceeds the interest paid on deposits and borrowed money 
changes in net interest income and the net interest margin ratio result from the interaction between the volume and composition of earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and their respective yields and funding costs 
the following comments refer to the table of average balances and rates and the rate volume analysis  both of which follow below 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the company net interest margin for decreased to from in the increase in net interest income is attributable exclusively to an increase in average earning assets

the average balance of interest earning assets increased million  or  during and the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or 
the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets primarily resulted from a million increase in the average balance of the loan portfolio and a million increase in the average balance of the security investment portfolio 
this was funded by a million increase in interest bearing liabilities driven largely by an increase in money market deposit accounts mmda and time deposits 
the makeup of the latter increase was largely composed of cdars deposits 
these increases in interest bearing liabilities  initiated to fund the loan growth needs  were the direct result of the company s strategic plan previously addressed 
interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased  or  during the decrease in yield on interest earning assets to in from in was more than offset by the increase in average volume 
this increase in average volume was primarily centered in average investment securities and  secondarily  average residential real estate loans and commercial loans 
interest expense on interest bearing liabilities decreased  or  as the rates paid dropped basis points to in from in the principal reason for the decline in rates paid was due to the greater concentration of cdars deposits within time deposits  as the company elected to acquire shorter term cdars deposits at current low market rates to provide the liquidity for the expected loan growth

capital adequacy is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios which measure capital against total assets  as well as against total assets that are weighted based on defined risk characteristics 
the company s goal is to support growth and expansion activities  while maintaining a strong capital position and exceeding regulatory standards 
at december   the bank exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios and met the regulatory definition of a well capitalized institution  ie a leverage capital ratio exceeding  a tier risk based capital ratio exceeding and a total risk based capital ratio exceeding 
as a result of the dodd frank act  the company s ability to raise new capital through the use of trust preferred securities may be limited because these securities will no longer be included in tier capital
