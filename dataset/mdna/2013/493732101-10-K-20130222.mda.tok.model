a report published by staffing industry analysts sia during indicated that information technology is expected to continue strong growth in the staffing market 
the report also mentioned that technology staffing companies are benefiting from a shift by consumers of technology staffing services away from independent contractors and into temporary staffing primarily due to increased employment compliance risk 
in addition to the shift of hiring to a temporary staffing model  sia states notable skill shortages in certain technology skill sets are continuing which we believe will result in strong growth prospects for our tech segment 
in addition  we believe this segment continues to benefit from our centralized national recruiting center nrc as well as our strategic accounts sa strategy  which we believe will also provide leverage in supporting future growth

our him professionals provide services in areas such as health information technology  the revenue life cycle and health information management 
we believe there will be strong demand in health information technology and medical coding through given requirements and deadlines for the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems  th edition icd conversion and electronic health record implementation 
gs according to the us office of management and budget  the federal government is one of the largest consumers of information technology  spending approximately billion in and currently budgeted to spend a similar amount in our gs segment provides tech and fa professionals to the federal government  primarily as a prime contractor 
gs also serves as a subcontractor to prime contractors  and we believe that our ability to source professional candidates for assignments  in combination with our prime contractor relationships  will allow us to pursue additional opportunities in this sector 
gs offers integrated business solutions to its customers in areas such as information technology  healthcare informatics  data and knowledge management  research and development  financial management and accounting  among other areas 
substantially all gs services are supplied to the federal government through field offices located in the washington  dc and san antonio  texas areas 
types of staffing services kforce s staffing services consist of temporary staffing services flex and permanent placement services search 
for the three years ended december   and  search represented  and of total kforce revenue  respectively 
flex we provide our clients with qualified individuals consultants on a temporary basis when it is determined that they have the appropriate skills and experience and are the right match for our clients 
we recruit consultants from the job boards  from our associates networks  from social media networks and from passive candidates we identify who are currently employed and not actively seeking another position 
our success is dependent upon our employees associates ability to understand and acknowledge our clients needs  determine and understand the capabilities of the consultants being recruited  and deliver and manage the client consultant relationship to the satisfaction of both our clients and our consultants 
we believe proper execution by our associates and our consultants directly impacts the longevity of the assignments  increases the likelihood of being able to generate repeat business with our clients and fosters a better experience for our consultants  which has a direct correlation to their redeployment 
flex revenue is driven by the number of total hours billed and established bill rates 
flex gross profit is determined by deducting consultant pay  benefits and other related costs from flex revenues 
flex associate commissions  related taxes and other compensation and benefits as well as field management compensation are included in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  along with administrative and corporate compensation 
the flex business model involves attempting to maximize the number of consultant hours and bill rates  while managing consultant pay rates and benefit costs  as well as compensation and benefits for our core associates 
flex revenue also includes solutions provided through our gs segment 
these revenues involve providing longer term contract services to the customer primarily on a time and materials basis but also on a fixed price and cost plus basis 

table of contents search our search business is a significantly smaller  yet important  part of our business that involves locating qualified individuals candidates for permanent placement with our clients 
we primarily perform these searches on a contingency basis  thus  fees are only earned if the candidates are ultimately hired by our clients 
the typical structure for search fees is based upon a percentage of the placed individual s annual compensation in their first year of employment  which is known at the time of placement 
we recruit permanent employees from the job boards  from our associates networks  social media networks and from passive candidates we identify who are currently employed and not actively seeking another position 
also  there are occasions where consultants are initially assigned to a client on a flex basis and later are converted to a permanent placement  for which we also receive a search fee referred to as conversion revenue 
we target clients and recruits for both flex and search services  which contributes to our objective of providing integrated solutions for all of our clients human capital needs 
search revenues are driven by placements made and the resulting fees billed and are recognized net of an allowance for fallouts  which occur when placements do not complete the applicable contingency period 
although the contingency period varies by contract  it is typically days or less 
this allowance for fallouts is estimated based upon historical experience with search placements that did not complete the contingency period 
there are no consultant payroll costs associated with search placements  thus  all search revenues increase gross profit by the full amount of the fee 
search associate commissions  compensation and benefits are included in sg a 
divestiture of kforce clinical research  inc kcr during march  kforce sold all of the issued and outstanding stock of kcr for a total cash purchase price of million plus a million post closing working capital adjustment 
the sale of kcr was consummated in order to narrow our focus  streamline our business mix  reduce our operating complexities and concentrate our resources on our core service offerings 
the divestiture of kcr has been classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements 
business strategy the key elements of our business strategy include the following retain our great people 
a significant focus of kforce is on the retention of our tenured and top performing associates 
we ended fiscal with a highly tenured management team  field sales team  and back office employees  which we believe will continue to enhance our ability to achieve future profitable growth 
invest in revenue responsible headcount 
given the current and expected future demand in the marketplace for the services provided by kforce and our most tenured associates performance continuing to remain near peak levels  the firm made significant investments in q in the hiring of associates that are responsible for generating revenue 
we refer to associates responsible for generating revenue as revenue responsible headcount 
the increase in revenue responsible headcount  inclusive of the nrc and sa  from q to q was and was from q to q new associates typically take six to nine months to begin performing at expected levels 
accordingly  we expect that this investment will result in accelerated revenue growth in the second half of while hiring is not expected to continue at the same pace  the firm expects to selectively continue to hire additional revenue responsible headcount in those lines of business  geographies and industries that we believe present the greatest opportunity 
continue to develop and optimize our nrc 
we believe our centralized nrc offers us a competitive advantage and that the nrc is particularly effective at increasing the quality and speed of delivery services to our clients  in particular our strategic accounts as well as other clients with demands for high volume staffing 
the nrc identifies and interviews active candidates from nationally contracted job boards  kforce 
com  as well as other sources  then forwards qualified candidates to kforce field offices to be matched to available positions 
the nrc has further evolved throughout to support all of our operating segments 
there continues to be a significant demand for its resources 
we continue to focus on job order prioritization which places greater attention on orders that we believe present the greatest opportunity and streamlining the nrc s focus to more specific industries  customer segments and skill sets to create leverage 
we also launched the kforce performer academy pilot  which trains and prepares qualified associates within the nrc  in order for them to be optimally deployed within kforce s field offices 
a continuing focus in will be on the retention  training  preparation and development of the performer academy  which may i enhance the performance of the nrc in meeting demand  ii enhance our efforts to support future growth and iii expand the nrc as our revenues increase 
in addition  the nrc will be focused on building a pipeline of qualified technology candidates as well as evolving its international talent solution strategy 

table of contents focus on our strategic accounts 
a focus of kforce is in cultivating relationships with strategic clients  both in terms of annual revenues and geographic dispersion 
for each of our sas kforce assigns a strategic accounts executive sae who is responsible for managing all aspects of our client relationship 
in order to achieve greater penetration within each of our sas  the sae  in partnership with our field leadership and revenue responsible teams  is tasked with fostering an understanding of our client s needs holistically while building a consultative partnership rather than a transactional client relationship 
we believe that this strategy will result in the expansion of our share of our clients staffing needs as well as capturing market share 
focus on value add services 
we focus on providing specialty staffing services and solutions to our clients 
the placement of highly skilled personnel requires operational and technical skill to effectively recruit and evaluate personnel  match them to client needs  and manage the resulting relationships 
we believe this strategy will serve to balance the desire for optimal volume  rate  effort and duration of assignment  while ultimately maximizing the benefit for our clients  consultants and the firm 
we concentrate resources among tech  fa  him and gs to the areas of highest anticipated demand to adapt to the ever changing landscape within the staffing industry 
we believe our historical focus in these markets  combined with our staff s operating expertise  provides us with a competitive advantage 
build long term  consultative relationships with our clients 
we believe we have developed long term relationships with our clients by repeatedly providing solutions to their specialty staffing requirements 
we strive to differentiate ourselves by working closely with our clients to understand their needs and maximize their return on human assets 
in addition  kforce s ability to offer flexible staffing services  coupled with our permanent placement capability  offers the client a broad spectrum of specialty staffing services 
we believe this ability enables kforce to emphasize consultative rather than transactional client relationships  and therefore facilitates further client penetration and the expansion of our share of our clients staffing needs 
optimize flex margins 
despite recent increases in statutory payroll taxes  particularly in unemployment taxes  we were able to improve our flex margins in this was accomplished through diligent management of both our bill rates as well as our consultant pay rates 
the optimization of flex margins remains a focus for kforce as the statutory costs are expected to continue to escalate 
accordingly  we will continue to attempt to optimize the spread between bill rates and pay rates by providing our associates with tools  economic knowledge and defined programs to drive improvement in the effectiveness of our pricing strategy around the staffing services we provide 
encourage employee achievement 
we focus on promoting and maintaining a quality focused  energetic  results oriented culture 
our field associates and corporate personnel are given incentives which include competitions with significant prizes  incentive trips and internal recognition  in addition to bonuses to encourage achievement of kforce s corporate goals and high levels of service 
during  we implemented and went live with a business intelligence tool referred to as amp  which is an acronym for actions maximizing performance  and have continued to expand this platform in and to include functionality for the nrc and sa teams 
this metrics based system has provided  and we expect will continue to provide  associates with current and historical performance measures relative to their kforce peers  which we believe fuels healthy competition and assists associates in reaching their maximum performance levels 
leverage infrastructure 
a significant focus for kforce is to more effectively leverage the functionality built over the last several years with its front end and back office technology infrastructure 
we believe our back office system software provides a competitive advantage through the enhancement of the efficiency and performance of our sales and delivery functions 
we will continue to selectively improve our front end systems and our back office systems  including our erp and time collection and billing systems  in areas that generate additional operating leverage 
industry overview we serve fortune companies  the federal government  state and local governments  local and regional companies  and small to mid sized companies 
our largest clients represented of revenues and no single customer accounted for more than of revenues for the year ended december  the specialty staffing industry is made up of thousands of companies  most of which are small local firms providing limited service offerings to a relatively small local client base 
we believe kforce is one of the largest publicly traded specialty staffing firms in the united states 
according to a recent report by sia  companies reported at least million in us staffing revenues in competition in a particular market can come from many different companies  both large and small 
we believe  however  that our geographic presence  diversified service offerings  centralized nrc  sa team  focus on consistent service and delivery and effective job order prioritization  all provide a competitive advantage  particularly with clients that have operations in multiple geographic markets 
in addition  we believe that our diversified portfolio of service offerings is primarily concentrated in areas with significant growth opportunities in both the short and long term 

table of contents based upon previous economic cycles experienced by kforce  we believe that times of sustained economic recovery generally stimulate demand for substantial additional us workers and  conversely  an economic slowdown results in a contraction in demand for additional us workers 
we also believe that flex demand generally increases before demand for permanent placements increases given that companies tend to prefer a flexible staffing model in the early stages of an economic recovery to ensure its sustainability 
from an economic standpoint  temporary employment figures and trends are important indicators of staffing demand  which improved during as compared to based on data published by the bureau of labor statistics bls 
total temporary employment increased and the penetration rate the percentage of temporary staffing to total employment increased in after seeing a slight increase in while we believe the macro employment picture continues to be relatively weak with the unemployment rate at as of january  non farm payroll expanded by  jobs in january and job growth has remained positive for consecutive months 
also  the college level unemployment rate  which serves as a proxy for professional employment and is more closely aligned with the firm s business strategy  was at as of december  management believes that uncertainty in the overall us economic outlook related to the political landscape  potential tax changes  geo political risk and impact of health care reform  will continue to fuel growth in temporary staffing as employers may be reluctant to increase full time hiring 
if the penetration rate of temporary staffing continues to experience growth in the coming years  we believe that our flex revenues can grow significantly even in a relatively modest growth macro economic environment 
management remains optimistic about the growth prospects of the temporary staffing industry  the penetration rate  and in particular  our revenue portfolio 
of course  no reliable predictions can be made about the general economy  the staffing industry as a whole  or specialty staffing in particular 
according to a recent staffing industry forecast published by sia  the us temporary staffing industry generated estimated revenues of billion in  billion in  and billion in  with projected revenues of billion in and in based on projected revenues of billion for the us temporary staffing industry  this would put the firm s market share at approximately 
therefore  our previously discussed business strategies are sharply focused around expanding our share of the us temporary staffing market and further penetrating our existing clients staffing needs 
over the last several years  our gs segment s operations have been adversely impacted by the i continued uncertainty of funding levels of various federal government programs and agencies  ii uncertain macro economic and political environment  and iii unexpected significant delays in the start up of already executed and funded projects  which we believe are due to acute shortages of acquisition and contracting personnel within certain federal government agencies 
these industry dynamics have resulted in gs adjusting its business strategy in and early in order to focus efforts on contracts that we believe achieve the right balance between revenue and profitability and are with federal government agencies less impacted by federal budget reductions 
a broad  automatic  and across the board reduction in most categories of federal government spending  referred to as sequestration  is currently scheduled to take effect on march  while it is difficult to determine the possible impact of sequestration due to the uncertainty over whether the cuts will happen as well as how the cuts would be distributed across the various federal government programs  sequestration  if it should occur  could have a significant adverse impact on gs s operations 
technology infrastructure a significant focus for kforce is to more effectively leverage its technology infrastructure 
we believe our back office systems provide a competitive advantage through the enhancement of the efficiency and performance of our sales and delivery functions 
we continue to focus on the improvement of our front end systems and our back office systems  including our time collection and billing systems 
the more significant investments in were as follows amp this metrics based system is designed to provide our field associates with current and historical performance relative to their kforce peers  which we believe will fuel positive competition and assist our field associates in reaching their highest performance levels 
during  we went live with the second phase of amp development  which provided dashboards displaying key metrics for the nrc and sa teams 
incentive compensation enterprise ice we believe that this compensation management software  which originally went live in january  will efficiently manage the processes around all variable compensation within the firm 
we believe that this software will also provide the appropriate visibility to management to manage the performance of our associates and help to ensure that kforce s pay for performance philosophy is adhered to 
during  in addition to modifications to certain compensation plans being managed within ice  we brought in compensation plans for  among others  the nrc and sa teams to be managed within ice 
we expect to more selectively invest in our infrastructure in and beyond  especially where we believe that it will provide for a sufficient return on capital and support the future growth in our business 
from a technology perspective  we expect to focus in on the development of a mobile application for which the initial phases will focus on consultant redeployment as well as on an automated solution for consultant onboarding 

table of contents trade names and trademarks the kforce trade names  and derivatives thereof  and the data confidence trademarks are important to our business 
our primary trade names and trademarks are registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
regulatory environment staffing firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulations i regulation of the employer employee relationship between a firm and its staff  such as wage and hour regulations  tax withholding and reporting  social security and other retirement  anti discrimination  employee benefits and workers compensation regulations  ii registration  licensing  recordkeeping and reporting requirements and iii substantive limitations on their operations 
staffing firms are governed by laws regulating the employer employee relationship 
in providing staffing services to the federal government  we must comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration  and performance of federal government contracts 
these laws and regulations create compliance risk and affect how we do business with our federal agency clients  and may impose added costs on our business 
for more discussion of the potential impact that the regulatory environment could have on kforce s financial results  please see item a 
risk factors below 
competition we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented specialty staffing services industry within each of our operating segments 
within temporary staffing  the working capital requirements is one of the more significant barriers to entry because most employees are paid weekly and customers may take to days or more to pay 
we face substantial competition from large national firms and local specialty staffing firms 
the local firms are typically operator owned  and each market generally has one or more significant competitors 
we also face competition from national clerical and light industrial staffing firms  and national and regional accounting firms that also offer certain specialty staffing services 
in addition  many companies utilize managed service providers msp for the management and purchase of staffing services 
generally  msps are organizations that standardize processes through the use of vendor management systems vms  which are tools used to aggregate spend and measure supplier performance 
vmss can also be provided through independent providers 
typically  msps and or vms providers charge staffing firms administrative fees of to of total service revenues  and these fees are usually recorded by staffing firms as a cost of services  thereby compressing profit margins 
there continues to be a saturation of core buyers using msps and or vms providers according to a survey conducted by sia 
while kforce does not currently provide msp or vms services directly to its clients  our strategy has been and is expected to continue to be to work with specific msps and vms providers to enable us to extend our flex staffing services to the widest customer base possible within the sectors we serve 
in the united states  there are staffing firms with more than million in us staffing revenues in operation and thousands of smaller organizations compete to varying degrees at local levels according to an sia report 
several similar companies global  national  and local compete in foreign markets 
our peer group for  which is composed of some of our largest competitors  included cdi corporation  ciber inc  computer task group inc  manpower group  on assignment inc  resources connection  inc  robert half international inc  and trueblue inc kforce believes that the availability and quality of associates and consultants  level of service  effective monitoring of job performance  scope of geographic service  and price are the principal elements of competition in our industry 
we believe that availability of quality associates and consultants is especially important 
in order to attract candidates  we place emphasis upon our ability to provide competitive compensation and benefits  quality and varied assignments  scheduling flexibility  and permanent placement opportunities 
because personnel pursue other employment opportunities on a regular basis  it is important that we respond to market conditions affecting these individuals 
additionally  in certain markets and in response to economic softening  we have experienced significant pricing pressure from some of our competitors 
although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors  we expect competition and pricing pressure to continue  and there can be no assurance that we will remain competitive 
seasonality of operating results our quarterly operating results are affected by the number of billing days in a quarter and the seasonality of our customers businesses 
the majority of our operating segments  especially him and gs  are significantly impacted by the increase in the number of holidays and vacation days taken during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
in addition  we experience an increase in direct costs of services and a corresponding decrease in gross profit in the first fiscal quarter of each year  as a result of certain annual us state and federal employment tax resets that occur at the beginning of each year 

table of contents insurance kforce maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability  automobile liability and employers liability  each with excess liability coverage 
we also maintain workers compensation  fidelity  fiduciary  directors and officers  professional liability  and employment practices liability policies 
these policies provide coverage subject to their terms  conditions  limits of liability  and deductibles  for certain liabilities that may arise from kforce s operations 
there can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs  or that we will maintain all such policies in the future 
financial information about foreign and domestic operations substantially all of kforce s revenues are derived from domestic operations with customers located in the united states and substantially all long lived assets are located in the united states for the three years ended december  one of our subsidiaries  global  provides outsourcing services internationally through an office in manila  philippines

risk factors 
kforce faces significant employment related legal risk 
kforce employs people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses 
many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information 
an inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of errors and omissions  intentional misconduct  release  misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property  confidential information  funds  or other property  discrimination and harassment claims  employment of illegal aliens  criminal activity  torts  or other claims 
such claims may result in negative publicity  injunctive relief  criminal investigations and or charges  payment by kforce of monetary damages or fines  or other material adverse effects on our business 
to reduce our exposure  we maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability  fidelity  employment practices liability  and general liability in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations 
our insurance coverage  however  may not cover all potential claims against us  may require us to meet a deductible or may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost 
in this regard  we face various employment related risks not covered by insurance  such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility 
us courts in recent years have been receiving large numbers of wage and hour class action claims alleging misclassification of overtime eligible workers and or failure to pay overtime eligible workers for all hours worked 
in addition  there appears to be a heightened state and federal scrutiny of independent contractor relationships  which could adversely affect us given that we utilize a significant number of independent contractors to perform our services 
an adverse determination of the independent contractor status of these firms could result in a substantial tax or other liabilities 
kforce may be adversely affected by government regulation of the staffing business  and of the workplace 
our business is subject to regulation and licensing in many states 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material 
if we fail to comply  such failure could materially adversely affect kforce s financial results 
a large part of our business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients workplaces 
increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer employee relationship could have a material adverse effect on kforce 
our collection  use and retention of personal information and personal health information create risks that may harm our business 
in the ordinary course of our business  we collect and retain personal information of our associates and flexible employees and their dependants including  without limitation  full names  social security numbers  addresses  birth dates  and payroll related information 
we also have access to  receive and use personal health information in the ordinary course of our him businesses 
we use commercially available information security technologies to protect such information in digital format 
we also use security and business controls to limit access to such information 
however  employees or third parties may be able to circumvent these measures and acquire or misuse such information  resulting in breaches of privacy  and errors in the storage  use or transmission of such information may result in breaches of privacy 
privacy breaches may require notification and other remedies  which can be costly  and which may have other serious adverse consequences for our business  including regulatory penalties and fines  claims for breach of contract  claims for damages  adverse publicity  reduced demand for our services by clients and or flex employment candidates  harm to our reputation  and regulatory oversight by state or federal agencies 
the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law  regulation  industry standards or contractual obligations 

table of contents kforce may be adversely affected by immigration restrictions 
our tech business utilizes a significant number of foreign nationals employed by us on work visas  primarily under the h b visa classification 
the h b visa classification that enables us employers to hire qualified foreign nationals is subject to legislative and administrative changes  as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement 
immigration laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political developments and levels of economic activity 
current and future restrictions on the availability of such visas could restrain our ability to employ the skilled professionals we need to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  the united states citizenship and immigration service uscis significantly increased its scrutiny of companies seeking to sponsor  renew or transfer h b status  including kforce and kforce s subcontractors 
on january   the uscis issued internal guidance to its field offices that appears to narrow the eligibility criteria for h b status in the context of staffing services 
in addition to uscis restrictions  certain aspects of the h b program are also subject to regulation and review by the us department of labor and us department of state  which have recently increased enforcement activities in the program 
a narrow interpretation and vigorous enforcement  or legislative action relating to immigration  including legislation intended to reform existing immigration law  could adversely affect our ability to obtain foreign national labor and or renew existing foreign national consultants on assignment  and could subject us to fines  penalties and sanctions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep or replace all foreign nationals currently on assignment  or continue to hire foreign national talent at the same rates as in the past 
kforce may not be able to maintain sufficient cash flow or borrowing capacity to support operations 
on september   kforce entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate led by bank of america  na  which was amended on march  the credit facility in conjunction with the divestiture of kcr 
the maximum borrowings available to kforce under the credit facility are limited to a a revolving credit facility of up to million the revolving loan amount and b a million sub limit included in the credit facility for letters of credit 
kforce s liquidity may be adversely impacted by covenants in our credit facility 
borrowing availability under the credit facility is limited to the remainder of a the lesser of i million minus the four week average aggregate weekly payroll of employees assigned to work for customers  or ii of the net amount of eligible accounts receivable  plus of the net amount of eligible unbilled accounts receivable  plus of the net amount of eligible employee placement accounts  minus certain minimum availability reserves  and in either case  minus b the aggregate outstanding amount under the credit facility 
under the credit facility  kforce is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants including but not limited to the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio if the firm s availability under the credit facility is less than the greater of of the aggregate amount of the commitment of all of the lenders under the credit facility and million 
kforce had availability under the credit facility of million as of december   therefore  the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to was not applicable 
kforce believes that it will be able to maintain the minimum availability requirement  however  in the event that kforce is unable to do so  kforce may fail the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  which would constitute an event of default 
at no time during the existence of the credit facility  or any of its predecessors ie  the credit agreement  the first amended and restated credit agreement and the second amended and restated credit agreement have we failed to meet the minimum availability and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements 
if we did not comply with these financial covenants  such a breach of the credit facility could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and could result  among other things  in the acceleration of all amounts borrowed under the credit facility

the financial markets may experience significant turmoil  which may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing 
our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our credit facility  or another financial institution  suffers liquidity issues 
in such an event  we may not be able to draw on any of the amounts available under our credit facility  or a substantial portion thereof 
the credit facility expires on september  if we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to  or as a replacement of  our credit facility  financial market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing on favorable terms 

table of contents kforce s temporary staffing business could be adversely impacted by the health care reform 
the health care and education reconciliation act of that was signed into law in march could have an adverse effect on kforce by increasing the cost of providing temporary staffing services 
the provisions of this act are expected to go into effect in while we believe the costs associated with the law should have less impact on kforce than many other staffing companies due to the level and scope of benefits we already offer  a delay in or inability to increase bill rates charged to our customers could result in a reduction of our flex gross profit 
we are exposed to intangible asset risk which could result in future impairment 
a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant decline in our or in one or more of our reporting units expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the business climate  or slower growth rates has resulted  and could result in the future  in the need to perform an impairment analysis in future periods 
if we were to conclude that a future write down of our goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary it could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates for further details 
significant legal actions could subject kforce to substantial uninsured liabilities 
professional service providers are subject to legal actions alleging malpractice  breach of contract and other legal theories 
these actions may involve large claims and significant defense costs 
we may also be subject to claims alleging violations of federal or state labor laws 
in addition  we may be subject to claims related to torts  intentional acts  or crimes committed by our full time employees or temporary staffing personnel 
in some instances  we are contractually obligated to indemnify clients against such risks 
a failure to observe the applicable standard of care  relevant kforce or client policies and guidelines  or applicable federal  state  or local laws  rules  and regulations could result in negative publicity  payment of fines  significant damage awards  or settlement expense 
to reduce our exposure  we maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability  fidelity  employment practices liability  and general liability in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations 
our insurance coverage  however  may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost 
we face certain risks in collecting our trade accounts receivable 
we generate a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from our customers 
delays or defaults in payments owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
factors that could cause a delay or default include business failures  turmoil in the financial and credit markets  sluggish or recessionary us economic conditions  our exposure to customers in high risk sectors such as the financial services industry  and declines in the credit worthiness of our customers 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
kforce s success depends upon retaining the services of its management team and key operating employees 
kforce is highly dependent on its management team and expects that continued success will depend largely upon their efforts and abilities 
the loss of the services of any key executive for any reason could have a material adverse effect upon kforce 
success also depends upon our ability to identify  develop  and retain qualified operating employees  particularly management  client servicing  and candidate recruiting employees 
kforce expends significant resources in the recruiting and training of its employees  as the pool of available applicants for these positions is limited 
the loss of some of our key operating employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our ability to establish and maintain client and candidate  professional  and technical relationships 

table of contents kforce depends on the proper functioning of its information systems 
kforce is dependent on the proper functioning of information systems in operating its business 
critical information systems are used in every aspect of kforce s daily operations  most significantly  in the identification and matching of staffing resources to client assignments and in the customer billing and consultant or vendor payment functions 
kforce s information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters we are headquartered and our leased data center are located in a hurricane prone area  fire or casualty theft  technical failures  terrorist acts  power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software intrusions  computer viruses  and similar events 
if our critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable  we would have to accomplish these functions manually  which could prove difficult or impossible  causing a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we depend on third party vendors for certain functions including the operations of our leased data center  whose future performance and reliability we cannot control 
significant increases in payroll related costs could adversely affect kforce s business 
kforce is required to pay a number of federal  state  and local payroll and related costs  including unemployment taxes  workers compensation and insurance premiums and claims  fica  and medicare  among others  related to our employees 
significant increases in the effective rates of any payroll related costs would likely have a material adverse effect on kforce 
over the last few years  many of the states in which kforce conducts business have continued to significantly increased their state unemployment tax rates in an effort to increase funding for unemployment benefits 
costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms or the possible imposition of additional requirements and restrictions related to the placement of personnel 
we may not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner or in a sufficient amount to cover these potential cost increases 
adverse results in tax audits could result in significant cash expenditures or exposure to unforeseen liabilities 
kforce is subject to periodic federal  state  and local tax audits for various tax years 
although kforce attempts to comply with all taxing authority regulations  adverse findings or assessments made by taxing authorities as the result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on kforce 
due to inherent limitations  there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors and fraud  or in making all material information known in a timely manner to management 
our management  including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within kforce have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time  a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
our business is dependent upon maintaining our reputation  our relationships  and our performance 
the reputation and relationships that we have established and currently maintain with our customers are important to maintaining existing business and identifying new business 
if our reputation or relationships were damaged  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  if our performance does not meet our customers expectations  our revenues and operating results could be materially harmed 

table of contents we rely on short term engagements with most of our clients 
because long term engagements are not a significant part of our business  other than in our gs segment  future financial results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 
we do not provide a vms solution 
many staffing customers are seeking to consolidate their use of staffing and solutions services through the use of a vms solution 
kforce provides consultants to these clients through other staffing companies who utilize a vms solution  but we do not currently provide this service directly to our clients 
there can be no assurance that we can continue to effectively compete with those companies that provide a vms solution 
if we must provide a vms solution  we could incur significant costs 
kforce s current market share may decrease as a result of limited barriers to entry for new competitors and discontinuation of clients outsourcing their staffing needs 
we face significant competition in the markets we serve  and there are limited barriers to entry for new competitors 
the competition among staffing services firms is intense 
kforce competes for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services  systems integrators  computer systems consultants  temporary personnel agencies  search firms  and other providers of staffing services 
some of our competitors possess substantially greater resources than we do 
from time to time  we experience significant pressure from our clients to reduce price levels 
during these periods  we may face increased competitive pricing pressures and may not be able to recruit the personnel necessary to fulfill our clients needs 
we also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective clients will decide to provide similar services internally 
competition for acquisition opportunities may restrict kforce s future growth by limiting our ability to make acquisitions at reasonable valuations 
kforce has increased its market share and presence in the staffing industry partly through strategic acquisitions of companies that have complemented or enhanced its business 
we have historically faced competition for acquisitions 
in the future  this could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly non accretive to us 
in addition  kforce may be limited by its ability to obtain financing to consummate desirable acquisitions 
kforce may not be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
kforce depends upon the abilities of its staff to attract and retain personnel  particularly technical  professional  and cleared government services personnel  who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our clients 
we must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies 
we expect significant competition for individuals with proven technical or professional skills for the foreseeable future 
if qualified personnel are not available to us in sufficient numbers and upon economic terms acceptable to us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents kforce may face significant risk arising from acquisitions 
kforce may face difficulties integrating future acquisitions into existing operations and acquisitions may be unsuccessful  involve significant cash expenditures  or expose kforce to unforeseen liabilities 
these acquisitions involve numerous risks  including potential loss of key employees or clients of acquired companies  difficulties integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into a single business  diversion of management attention from existing operations  and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies 
these acquisitions may also involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence  integration expenses  and exposure to unforeseen liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business and financial condition 
provisions in kforce s articles and bylaws and under florida law may have certain anti takeover effects 
kforce s articles of incorporation and bylaws and florida law contain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
in particular  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board of directors and permit the removal of directors only for cause 
additionally  management may issue up to million shares of preferred stock  and fix the rights and preferences thereof  without a further vote of the shareholders 
in addition  certain of our officers and managers have employment agreements containing certain provisions that call for substantial payments to be made to such employees in certain circumstances upon a change in control 
certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of kforce  including an acquisition in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
moreover  the existence of these provisions could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
kforce s stock price may be volatile 
kforce s common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol kfrc 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including our operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  the employment services industry  or other developments affecting us  our clients  or our competitors  some of which may be unrelated to our performance 
in addition  the stock market in general  especially the nasdaq global select market tier  along with market prices for staffing companies  has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
among other things  volatility in our stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices they pay 
the volatility also could impair our ability in the future to offer common stock as a source of additional capital or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 

table of contents risks related to our government businesses kgs is substantially dedicated to contracting with and serving us federal government agencies the federal agency business  primarily as a prime contractor 
in addition  kforce supplies services to the federal government  primarily as a staffing services provider to federal prime contractors 
federal contractors  including kgs and kforce face a number of risks  including the following our failure to comply with complex federal procurement laws and regulations could cause us to lose business  incur additional costs  and subject us to a variety of penalties  including suspension and debarment from doing business with the federal government 
we must comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration  and performance of federal government contracts 
these laws and regulations create compliance risk  affect how we do business with our federal agency clients  and may impose added costs on our business 
if a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  harm to our reputation  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
kgs is operating under an administrative agreement with the united states department of interior doi  which imposes significant training requirements  oversight and controls on kgs throughout its term  which is currently expected to end on september  the failure of kgs to comply with the administrative agreement during this period could have a material adverse impact on kgs and kforce  including suspension and debarment from doing business with the federal government 
the federal government also may reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations  including cost accounting standards  that could be costly to satisfy or that could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
a failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions  or suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government  each of which could lead to a material reduction in our revenues  cash flows and operating results 
unfavorable government audit results could force us to refund previously recognized revenues and could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions 
federal agencies can audit and review our performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure  incurred cost submissions and compliance with applicable laws  regulations  and standards 
an audit of our work  including an audit of work performed by companies kforce has acquired or may acquire  or subcontractors we have hired or may hire  could force us to refund previously recognized revenues 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
in addition  we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us  whether or not true 
we are dependent upon the ability of government agencies to administratively manage our contracts 
after we are awarded a contract and the contract is funded by the federal government  we are still dependent upon the ability of the relevant agency to administratively manage our contract 
we can be adversely impacted by delays in the start up of already awarded and funded projects  including delays due to shortages of acquisition and contracting personnel within the federal government agencies 
the failure by congress to approve budgets  raise the us debt ceiling or avoid sequestration on a timely basis for the federal agencies we support could delay  reduce or stop federal spending and cause us to lose revenue 
on an annual basis  congress must approve and the president must sign the appropriation bills that govern spending by each of the federal agencies we support 
if congress is unable to agree on budget priorities and is unable to appropriate funds or pass the annual budget on a timely basis  as has been the case in recent years  there may be delays  reductions or cessations of funding for our services and solutions 
in addition  from time to time it has been necessary for congress to raise the us debt ceiling in order to allow for borrowing necessary to fund government operations 
if congress fails to raise the debt ceiling on a timely basis  there may be delays  reductions or cessations of funding for our services and solutions 
furthermore  legislatively mandated cuts in federal programs  known as sequestration  could result in delays  reductions or cessation of funding for our services and solutions 

table of contents changes in the spending policies or budget priorities of the federal government could cause us to lose revenue 
changes in federal government fiscal or spending policies could materially adversely affect our government agency business  in particular  our business could be materially adversely affected by decreases in federal government spending 
our federal agency business is dependent upon maintaining our reputation  our relationships and our performance 
the reputation and relationships that we have established and currently maintain with government personnel and agencies are important to maintaining existing business and identifying new business 
if our reputation or relationships were damaged  it could have a material adverse effect 
in addition  if our performance does not meet agency expectations  our revenues and operating results could be materially harmed 
competition is intense in the federal agency business 
there is often intense competition to win federal agency contracts 
even when a contract is awarded to us  competitors may protest such awards 
if we are unable to successfully compete for new business or win competitions to maintain existing business  our operations could be materially adversely affected 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources  larger client bases  and greater brand recognition than we do 
our larger competitors also may be able to provide clients with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide 
loss of our general services administration gsa schedules or other contracting vehicles could impair our ability to win new business 
gsa schedules constitute a significant percentage of revenues from our federal agency clients 
if we were to lose one or more of these schedules or other contracting vehicles  we could lose revenues and our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
these schedules or contracts typically have an initial term with multiple options that may be exercised by our government agency clients to extend the contract for successive periods of one or more years 
we can provide no assurance that our clients will exercise these options 
our failure to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances may limit our ability to perform classified work for government clients  which could cause us to lose business 
some government contracts require us to maintain facility security clearances and require some of our employees to maintain individual security clearances 
if our employees lose or are unable to timely obtain security clearances  or we lose a facility clearance  a government agency client may terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration 
our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities  which could harm our business 
like all government contractors  we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
misconduct by our employees could include intentional failures to comply with federal government procurement regulations  engaging in unauthorized activities  seeking reimbursement for improper expenses  or falsifying time records 
employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or classified information  which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and precautions to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling such risks or losses  which could materially adversely affect our business 
security breaches in sensitive government information systems could result in the loss of our clients and cause negative publicity 
many of the systems we develop  install  and maintain involve managing and protecting information used in intelligence  national security  and other sensitive or classified government functions 
a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business  damage our reputation  and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for federal government clients 
we could incur losses from such a security breach that could exceed the policy limits under our insurance 
damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of our systems could materially reduce our revenues

we believe the possibility of further losses related to this matter is remote 
as disclosed in our previous filings with the sec  on june   the chicago district office of the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc issued a determination on a charge of discrimination  brought by an individual in  that reasonable cause exists to believe that kforce discriminated against two classes of individuals because of their age 
kforce and the eeoc engaged in conciliation efforts

while management does not expect any of these other matters to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows  litigation is subject to certain inherent uncertainties 
kforce maintains liability insurance in such amounts and with such coverage and deductibles as management believes is reasonable 
the principal liability risks that kforce insures against are workers compensation  personal injury  bodily injury  property damage  directors and officers liability  errors and omissions  employment practices liability and fidelity losses 
there can be no assurance that kforce s liability insurance will cover all events or that the limits of coverage will be sufficient to fully cover all liabilities 
kforce is not aware of any litigation that would reasonably be expected to have a material effect on its results of operations  its cash flows or its financial condition
