item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive summary of consolidated results of operations in this discussion and analysis  the company analyzes contributions to consolidated earnings and earnings per share from its utility group and nonutility group separately since each operates independently requiring distinct competencies and business strategies  offers different energy and energy related products and services  and experiences different opportunities and risks 
the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
the primary source of cash flow for the utility group results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the activities of  and revenues and cash flows generated by  the nonutility group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
in addition  there are other operations  referred to herein as corporate and other  that include unallocated corporate expenses such as advertising and charitable contributions  among other activities 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 
net income and earnings per share  in total and by group  for the years ended december    and follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other basic earnings per share attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other utility group gas utility services the gas utility segment earned million during the year ended december   compared to earnings of million in and million in the increased earnings in reflect revenues and the deferral for future recovery of some operating expenses from regulatory orders allowing for recovery of and accounting for infrastructure replacement activities in ohio 
year over year  interest expense was also favorably impacted by financing transactions completed in late and early in  increased operating expenses associated with planned maintenance activities  environmental remediation efforts  and a brief work stoppage related to bargaining unit labor negotiations unfavorably impacted earnings compared to electric utility services the electric operations earned million during  compared to million in and million in results in and were positively impacted by new electric base rates implemented on may  in addition  lower interest costs associated with refinancing activity favorably impacted results in these increased results in were somewhat offset by lower small customer margin from conservation initiatives net of lost margin recovery 
the increased earnings in driven by the base rate increase  compared to  were offset somewhat by summer weather that  while warmer than normal  was cooler than the extreme summer temperatures in earnings in were also reduced by increased power supply operating expenses associated with planned electric generating maintenance activities 
other utility operations in  earnings from other utility operations were million  compared to million in and million in differences in the utility group effective tax rate among the periods presented resulted in the lower earnings in the higher income tax rate in was driven by the revaluation of utility group deferred income taxes related to the fourth quarter sale of vectren source  a nonutility retail energy marketer  which resulted in a charge to utility group income taxes of approximately million 
also includes a million unfavorable tax adjustment 
nonutility group in  nonutility group earnings were million  compared to earnings of million in and million in results over these periods were favorably impacted by the march  acquisition of minnesota limited and significantly higher demand for pipeline construction and repair 
weakness in coal prices in and lower natural gas prices over the last several years have negatively impacted results from the company commodity driven coal and wholesale gas marketing operations 
however  losses incurred by energy marketer  proliance  narrowed in compared to  due primarily to lower demand costs for pipeline storage and transportation 
nonutility group results were impacted by a gain on the sale of retail natural gas marketer  vectren source  on december   totaling million after tax 
after tax charges related to legacy investments totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
corporate other the results in corporate and other during primarily reflect a contribution to the vectren foundation  a c charitable organization  totaling million  or million after tax 
the contribution is reflected in other operating expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
dividends dividends declared for the year ended december  were per share  compared to per share in and per share in in november  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
the increase marks the rd consecutive year vectren and predecessor companies have increased annual dividends paid 
use of non gaap performance measures and per share measures per share earnings contributions of the utility group  nonutility group  and corporate and other are presented and are non gaap measures 
such per share amounts are based on the earnings contribution of each group included in vectren s consolidated results divided by vectren s basic average shares outstanding during the period 
the earnings per share of the groups do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to the groups  but rather represent a direct equity interest in vectren corporation assets and liabilities as a whole 
these non gaap measures are used by management to evaluate the performance of individual businesses 
in addition  other items giving rise to period over period variances  such as weather  are presented on an after tax and per share basis 
these amounts are calculated at a statutory tax rate divided by vectren s basic average shares outstanding during the period 
accordingly  management believes these measures are useful to investors in understanding each business contribution to consolidated earnings per share and in analyzing consolidated period to period changes and the potential for earnings per share contributions in future periods 
reconciliations of the non gaap measures to their most closely related gaap measure of consolidated earnings per share are included throughout this discussion and analysis 
the non gaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap  and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap 
detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility and nonutility operations 
the detailed results of operations for these groups are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 
results of operations of the utility group the utility group is comprised of utility holdings operations and consists of the company s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
regulated operations consist of a natural gas distribution business that provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio and an electric transmission and distribution business  which provides electric distribution services primarily to southwestern indiana  and its power generating and wholesale power operations 
in total  these regulated operations supply natural gas and or electricity to over one million customers 
utility group operating results before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility electric utility other total operating revenues operating expenses cost of gas sold cost of fuel purchased power other operating depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses operating income other income net interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income contribution to vectren basic eps the regulatory environment gas and electric operations  with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  financing  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers the operations of sigeco and indiana gas  are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of vedo are subject to regulation by the puco 
over the last six years  orders establishing new base rates have been received by each utility 
sigeco s electric territory received an order in april  effective may  and its gas territory received an order in august indiana gas received its most recent base rate order in february and vedo in january with implementation in february the orders authorize a return on equity ranging from percent to percent 
the authorized returns reflect the impact of innovative rate design strategies that have been authorized by these state commissions 
outside of a full base rate proceeding  these approaches mitigate to some extent the impacts of investments in government mandated and other infrastructure replacement projects  operating costs that are volatile  and changing consumption patterns 
in addition to timely gas and fuel cost recovery  approximately million of the utility group s approximate million in other operating expenses incurred during are subject to recovery mechanisms outside of base rates 
rate design strategies sales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers are largely seasonal and are impacted by weather 
trends in average use among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed and the company s utilities have implemented conservation programs 
in the company s two indiana natural gas service territories  normal temperature adjustment nta and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns 
the ohio natural gas service territory has a straight fixed variable rate design for its residential customers 
this rate design  which was fully implemented in february  mitigates approximately percent of the ohio service territory s weather risk and risk of decreasing consumption 
prior to the implementation of this rate design  the ohio service territory had a decoupling mechanism 
in all natural gas service territories  commissions have authorized bare steel and cast iron replacement programs 
sigeco s electric service territory currently recovers certain transmission investments outside of base rates 
the electric service territory has neither an nta nor a decoupling mechanism  however  rate designs provide for a lost margin recovery mechanism that works in tandem with conservation initiatives 
tracked operating expenses gas costs and fuel costs incurred to serve indiana customers are two of the company s most significant operating expenses 
rates charged to natural gas customers in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause 
the gca clause allows the company to timely charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas  inclusive of unaccounted for gas expense based on actual experience  subject to caps that are based on historical experience 
electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for timely adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel 
the net energy cost of purchased power  subject to an approved variable benchmark based on nymex natural gas prices  is also timely recovered through the fac 
gca and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between actual recoveries representing the estimated costs and actual costs incurred 
since april  the company has not been the supplier of natural gas in its ohio territory 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
the fac earnings test had some impact on the company s operating results  as discussed below 
in indiana  gas pipeline integrity management operating costs  costs to fund energy efficiency programs  miso costs  and the gas cost component of uncollectible accounts expense based on historical experience are recovered by mechanisms outside of standard base rate recovery 
certain operating costs  including depreciation  associated with regional electric transmission assets not in base rates are also recovered by mechanisms outside of standard base rate recovery 
in ohio  expenses such as uncollectible accounts expense  costs associated with exiting the merchant function  and costs associated with a distribution riser replacement program are subject to recovery outside of base rates 
revenues and margins are also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes  which primarily fluctuate with gas and fuel costs 
in  state laws in both indiana and ohio were passed that expand the ability of utilities to recover certain costs of federally mandated projects  and in ohio other capital investment projects  outside of a base rate proceeding 
utilization of these mechanisms will likely increase in the coming years 
see the rate and regulatory matters section of this discussion and analysis for more specific information on significant proceedings involving the company s utilities over the last three years 
utility group margin throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas sold 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative earnings contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel and purchased power costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 
gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas sold gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions gas utility revenues cost of gas sold total gas utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers other sold transported volumes in mmdth attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers total sold transported volumes gas utility margins were million for year ended december   and compared to  decreased million 
the impact of low natural gas prices and mild weather on revenue taxes  late and reconnect fees  and volumetric pass through costs decreased gas utility margin million in compared to returns generated on investments in infrastructure replacement in ohio increased margins million in compared to the prior year 
excluding the impact of regulatory initiatives and pass through costs  large customer margins increased million on increasing volumes 
with rate designs that substantially limit the impact of weather on margin  heating temperatures in that were percent of normal in indiana and percent of normal in ohio had a significant impact on small volumes sold  but only a slightly negative impact on margin  reducing margin million year over year 
large customer volumes in compared to significantly increased due to natural gas transported to a natural gas fired power plant that was recently placed into service in the vectren south service territory 
volumes delivered to this customer are based on a monthly fixed charge and began in when service was initiated 
for the year ended december   gas utility margins decreased million compared to margin decreased million year over year due to lower revenue taxes and operating costs recovered in margin 
management estimates a decrease of million due to ohio rate design changes  as described below 
returns generated on investments in infrastructure replacement in ohio increased margins million year over year 
large customer margin  net of the impacts of regulatory initiatives and pass through costs  increased by million due primarily to ethanol producers 
the rate design approved by the puco on january   and initially implemented on february   allowed for the phased movement toward a straight fixed variable rate design 
this rate design places substantially all of the fixed cost recovery in the monthly customer service charge 
since the straight fixed variable rate design was fully implemented for residential base rates in february  nearly percent of the combined residential and commercial base rate gas margins were recovered through the customer service charge since that date 
margin recognized in reflects the full implementation of the rate design which resulted in a decrease in margin in compared to in  there was volumetric recovery during the peak delivery periods of january and february 
electric utility margin electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power electric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows year ended december  in millions electric utility revenues cost of fuel purchased power total electric utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other customers subtotal retail wholesale margin total electric utility margin electric volumes sold in gwh attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other total retail firm wholesale volumes sold retail electric retail utility margins were million for the year ended december  and  compared to  increased by million 
the impact year over year of new retail base rates that were effective may  was an increase in margin of approximately million 
offsetting a portion of the increase was a decline in small customer usage that lowered margin by million in as a result of energy conservation  net of an approved lost margin recovery mechanism 
weather also impacted margin and  compared to normal temperatures  increased results million and million  in and  respectively 
due in part to the favorable weather in both periods  the company provided refunds to customers in totaling million pursuant to the statutory earnings test 
indiana regulation includes a statutory mechanism that can limit a utility rolling twelve month net operating income to that authorized in its last general rate order  as adjusted for previous net operating income levels that were below authorized levels 
should weather or other factors continue to increase net operating income in future periods  the full benefit of those favorable impacts on the company electric utility may continue to be limited by the statutory earnings test 
finally  though volumes sold to large customers during decreased  the impact on margin was small as certain large customers have rate structures that include both a daily peak usage component  as well as a volumetric component 
in  electric retail utility margins increased million compared to the impact of new base rates increased margin million 
management estimates the impact of weather  which was warmer than normal but cooler compared to the prior year  to have decreased residential and commercial margin million 
margin increased million year over year due to increased miso operating costs that are recovered in margin 
in  management estimates that cooling weather percent of normal increased margin compared to normal by million 
margin from wholesale electric activities the company earns a return on electric transmission projects constructed by the company in its service territory that meet the criteria of miso s regional transmission expansion plans and also markets and sells its generating and transmission capacity to optimize the return on its owned assets 
substantially all off system sales are generated in the miso day ahead and real time markets when sales into the miso in a given hour are greater than amounts purchased for native load 
further detail of miso off system margin and transmission system margin follows year ended december  in millions transmission system margin off system margin total wholesale margin transmission system margin associated with qualifying projects  including the reconciliation of recovery mechanisms  and other transmission system operations  totaled million during  compared to million in and million in increases are primarily due to increased investment in qualifying projects 
to date  the company has invested million in qualifying projects 
these projects include an interstate kv transmission line that connects vectren s ab brown generating station to a generating station in indiana owned by duke energy to the north and to a generating station in kentucky owned by big rivers electric corporation to the south  a substation  and another transmission line 
once placed into service  these projects earn a ferc approved equity rate of return of percent on the net plant balance  and operating expenses are also recovered 
the kv project is the largest of these qualifying projects  with a cost of million that earned the ferc approved equity rate of return while under construction 
the last segment of that project was placed into service in december for the year ended december   margin from off system sales was million  compared to million in and million in the base rate changes implemented in may require that wholesale margin from off system sales earned above or below million per year be shared equally with customers 
this compares to a million sharing threshold established in results for the periods presented reflect the impact of that sharing 
off system sales totaled gwh in  compared to gwh in  and gwh in the lower volumes sold in from vectren south primarily coal fired generation result from increased sales of power in miso from gas fired electric generation due to low natural gas prices and more wind generation 
utility group operating expenses other operating for the year ended december   other operating expenses were million  and compared to  decreased million 
excluding pass through costs  expenses were essentially flat 
continuous improvement initiatives throughout the utility group are being implemented to limit growth in operating expenses over the coming years 
the company estimates that in these initiatives have resulted in sustainable savings of more than million 
examples of the initiatives implemented in include improved processes that have allowed the company to become more efficient in completing work and thereby reduce labor costs and recent amendments to postretirement medical plans that provide better access to benefits for retirees at lower costs to the company 
these sustainable savings have aided in offsetting planned increases in energy delivery related operating expenses 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased million compared to the increase is primarily attributable to higher electric power supply operating expenses 
such expenses increased million year over year with million attributed to planned outage maintenance and million attributed to variable production costs 
the remaining variance is primarily attributable to higher expected energy delivery costs 
depreciation amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense was million  compared to million in and million in the periods presented reflect increased utility plant investments placed into service 
however  in regulatory orders allowing for deferral of depreciation on capital investments previously placed into service were received that more than offset the impact of utility plant increases in and partially offset increases in taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes decreased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the decrease in was primarily due to lower usage taxes associated with lower gas and fuel costs 
the decrease in is primarily attributable to lower ohio excise and usage taxes associated with that territory s process of exiting the merchant function 
these taxes are primarily revenue related taxes and are offset dollar for dollar with lower gas utility revenues 
other income net other income net reflects income of million in  compared to million in and million in results in include approximately million of increased afudc compared to afudc in reflects the impact of recent regulatory orders related to the infrastructure replacement investments 
in addition  results in and in reflect increased returns on assets that fund benefit plans compared to interest expense for year ended december   interest expense was million  compared to million in and million in the decreases among the years are primarily due to fourth quarter refinancing activity in which million of long term debt with a percent interest rate matured and was replaced with million of new long term debt with an average interest rate of percent and million of short term borrowings 
during the fourth quarter of  the company also called million of long term debt at a rate of percent and replaced that issuance in february with new debt at a rate of percent 
income taxes in  utility group federal and state income taxes were million  compared to million in and million in changes in income taxes are primarily driven by changes in pre tax income 
in addition  the effective income tax rate in was higher primarily due to the revaluation of utility group deferred income taxes from the fourth quarter sale of vectren source which resulted in a million charge  and a million unfavorable tax adjustment recognized earlier in that year 
rate regulatory matters regulatory treatment of investments in natural gas infrastructure replacement vectren monitors and maintains its natural gas distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered in a safe and efficient manner 
vectren natural gas utilities are currently engaged in replacement programs in both indiana and ohio  the primary purpose of which is preventive maintenance and continual renewal and operational improvement 
in  laws in both indiana and ohio were passed that expand the ability of utilities to recover certain costs of federally mandated projects  and in ohio other capital investment projects  outside of a base rate proceeding 
utilization of these recovery mechanisms is discussed below 
ohio recovery and deferral mechanisms the puco order approving the company base rate case in the ohio service territory authorized a distribution replacement rider drr 
the drr primary purpose is recovery of investments in utility plant and related operating expenses associated with replacing bare steel and cast iron pipelines and certain other infrastructure 
this rider is updated annually for qualifying capital expenditures and allows for a return to be earned on those capital expenditures based upon the rate of return approved in the base rate case 
in addition  deferral of depreciation and the ability to accrue debt related post in service carrying costs is also allowed until the related capital expenditures are recovered through the drr 
to date  the company has made capital investments under this rider totaling million 
during   and gas operating revenues associated with the drr were million  million  and million  respectively 
other income associated with the debt related post in service carrying costs totaled million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
regulatory assets associated with post in service carrying costs and depreciation deferrals were million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
in june  ohio house bill was signed into law 
outside of a base rate proceeding  this legislation permits a natural gas company to apply for recovery of much of its capital expenditure program 
once such application is approved  the legislation authorizes a deferral of costs  such as depreciation  property taxes  and debt related carrying costs 
on december   the puco issued an order approving the company initial application using this law 
the order provides for the deferral of depreciation  debt related post in service carrying costs  and property taxes for its million capital expenditure program covering the fifteen month period ending december  such capital expenditures include infrastructure expansion and improvements not covered by the drr as well as expenditures necessary to comply with puco rules  regulations  orders  and system expansion to some new customers 
the order also established a prospective bill impact evaluation on the cumulative deferrals  limiting the total deferrals at a level which would equal per residential and general service customer per month 
the order created a regulatory asset as of december  of million  of which million is other income related to the accrual of post in service carrying costs  and the remaining million is the deferral of depreciation and property tax expense 
the company expects to make a future request for similar accounting authority on its capital expenditure program for the calendar year based on the deferral of costs and continuing recognition of debt related post in service carrying costs using the capital structure  regulatory assets associated with these infrastructure programs increased million in regulatory assets are expected to continue to increase in future periods as post in service carrying costs are recognized in the statement of income and operating costs are deferred 
historical relationships between rate base growth and depreciation expense and property taxes will also be impacted 
indiana recovery and deferral mechanisms the company indiana natural gas utilities received orders in and associated with the most recent base rate cases 
these orders authorized the deferral of financial impacts associated with bare steel and cast iron replacement activities 
the orders provide for the deferral of depreciation and post in service carrying costs on qualifying projects totaling million annually at vectren north and million annually at vectren south 
for usgaap accounting purposes only the debt related post in service carrying costs are recognized in the consolidated statements of income currently 
such deferral is limited by individual qualifying project to three years after being placed into service at vectren south and four years after being placed into service at vectren north 
the debt related post in service rate used to calculate the deferral is based on a current cost of funds 
at december  and  the company has usgaap regulatory assets totaling million and million  respectively  associated with the deferral of depreciation and debt related post in service carrying cost activities 
in april  senate bill was signed into indiana law 
the law provides a framework to recover percent of federally mandated costs through a periodic rate adjustment mechanism outside of a general rate case 
such costs include a return on the federally mandated capital investment  along with recovery of depreciation and other operating costs associated with these mandates 
the remaining percent of those costs are to be deferred for future recovery in the utility next general rate case 
to date  the company has not initiated a filing requesting authority to recover costs using the senate bill approach and continues to study its applicability to expenditures associated with its natural gas distribution operations 
pipeline safety law on january   the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty and job creation act of pipeline safety law was signed into law 
the pipeline safety law  which reauthorizes federal pipeline safety programs through fiscal year  provides for enhanced safety  reliability  and environmental protection in the transportation of energy products by pipeline 
the law increases federal enforcement authority  grants the federal government expanded authority over pipeline safety  provides for new safety regulations and standards  and authorizes or requires the completion of several pipeline safety related studies 
the dot is required to promulgate a number of new regulatory requirements over the next two years those regulations may eventually lead to further regulatory or statutory requirements 
the company continues to study the impact of the pipeline safety law and potential new regulations associated with its implementation 
at this time  compliance costs and other effects associated with the increased pipeline safety regulations remain uncertain 
however  the law is expected to result in further investment in pipeline inspections  and where necessary  additional investments in pipeline infrastructure  and therefore  result in both increased levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with the company natural gas distribution businesses 
operating expenses associated with expanded compliance requirements may grow by approximately million annually  with million attributable to the indiana operations 
related to the indiana operations  the company expects to seek recovery under senate bill  or such costs may be recoverable through current tracking mechanisms 
capital investments  associated with the pipeline safety law  are expected to be significant 
the company expects to seek recovery of capital investments associated with complying with these federal mandates in accordance with senate bill in indiana and house bill or other currently authorized recovery mechanisms  such as the distribution replacement rider  in ohio 
vectren south electric base rate filing on december   vectren south filed a request with the iurc to adjust its base electric rates 
the requested increase in base rates addressed capital investments  a modified electric rate design that would facilitate a partnership between vectren south and customers to pursue energy efficiency and conservation  and new energy efficiency programs to complement those currently offered for natural gas customers 
the iurc issued an order in the case on april  the order provided for a revenue increase to recover costs associated with approximately million in system upgrades that were completed in the three years leading up to the december filing and modest increases in maintenance and operating expenses 
the approved revenue increase is based on rate base of  million  return on equity of percent  and an overall rate of return of percent 
the new rates were effective may  the iurc  in its order  provided for deferred accounting treatment related to the company estimated million investment in dense pack technology  of which approximately million has been invested as of december  in addition  the iurc denied the company s request for implementation of the decoupled rate design  which is discussed further below 
addressing issues raised in the case concerning coal supply contracts and related costs  the iurc found that current coal contracts remain effective and that a prospective review process of future procurement decisions would be initiated 
coal procurement procedures vectren south submitted a request for proposal rfp in april regarding coal purchases for a four year period beginning in after negotiations with bidders  vectren south reached an agreement in principle for multi year purchases with two suppliers  one of which is vectren fuels  inc consistent with the iurc direction in the electric rate case  a sub docket proceeding was established to review the company s prospective coal procurement procedures  and the company submitted evidence related to its rfp 
in march  the iurc issued its order in the sub docket which concluded that vectren south s rfp process resulted in the lowest fuel cost reasonably possible 
in late  vectren south terminated its contract with one of the suppliers due to coal quality issues that were identified during test burns of the coal 
in addition to coal purchased under these contracts  vectren south has also contracted with vectren fuels  inc to purchase lower priced spot coal 
this spot purchase was found to be reasonable in a recent fac order 
the iurc will continue to regularly monitor vectren south s procurement process in future fuel adjustment proceedings 
delivery to vectren power plants of lower priced contract coal from the april rfp process began during on december  within the quarterly fac filing  vectren south submitted a joint proposal with the oucc to reduce its fuel costs billed to customers by accelerating into the impact of lower cost coal under these new term contracts effective after the cost difference will be deferred to a regulatory asset and recovered over a six year period without interest beginning in the iurc approved this proposal on january   with the reduction to customer s rates effective february  the deferred amount includes a reduction in the value of the coal inventory at december  of approximately million to reflect existing coal inventory at the new  lower price 
deferrals related to coal purchases in have totaled approximately million  bringing the total deferred balance as of december   to the expected level of million 
vectren south electric demand side management program filing on august   vectren south filed a petition with the iurc  seeking approval of its proposed electric demand side management dsm programs  recovery of the costs associated with these programs  recovery of lost margins as a result of implementing these programs for large customers  and recovery of performance incentives linked with specific measurement criteria on all programs 
the dsm programs proposed were consistent with a december  order issued by the iurc  which  among other actions  defined long term conservation objectives and goals of dsm programs for all indiana electric utilities under a consistent statewide approach 
in order to meet these objectives  the iurc order divided the dsm programs into core and core plus programs 
core programs are joint programs required to be offered by all indiana electric utilities to all customers  and include some for large industrial customers 
core plus programs are those programs not required specifically by the iurc  but defined by each utility to meet the overall energy savings targets defined by the iurc 
on august  the iurc issued an order approving an initial three year dsm plan in the vectren south service territory that complied with the iurc s energy saving targets 
consistent with the company s proposal  the order approved  among other items  the following recovery of costs associated with implementing the dsm plan  the recovery of a performance incentive mechanism based on measured savings related to certain dsm programs  lost margin recovery associated with the implementation of dsm programs for large customers  and deferral of lost margin up to million in and million in associated with small customer dsm programs for subsequent recovery under a tracking mechanism to be proposed by the company 
on june   the iurc issued an order approving a small customer lost margin recovery mechanism  inclusive of all previous deferrals 
this mechanism is an alternative to the electric decoupling proposal that was denied by the iurc in the company last base rate proceeding discussed earlier 
vectren north pipeline safety investigation on april   the iurc pipeline safety division filed a complaint against vectren north alleging several violations of safety regulations pertaining to damage that occurred at a residence in vectren north service territory during a pipeline replacement project 
the company negotiated a settlement with the iurc pipeline safety division  agreeing to a fine and several modifications to the company operating policies 
the amount of the fine was not material to the company financial results 
the iurc approved the settlement but modified certain terms of the settlement and added a requirement that company employees conduct inspections of pipeline excavations 
the company sought and was granted a request for rehearing on the sole issue related to the requirement to use company employees to inspect excavations 
the company seeks further clarity on the scope of the requirement and the ability to also use contractors to perform certain inspections 
a procedural schedule is expected to be established in late february vectren north vectren south gas decoupling extension filing on april   the company s indiana based gas companies vectren north and vectren south filed with the iurc a joint settlement agreement with the oucc on an extension of the offering of conservation programs and the supporting gas decoupling mechanism originally approved in december on august   the iurc issued an order approving the settlement as filed  granting the extension of the current decoupling mechanism in place at both gas companies and recovery of new conservation program costs through december vedo gas rate design the rate design approved by the puco on january   and initially implemented on february   allowed for the phased movement toward a straight fixed variable rate design  which places substantially all of the fixed cost recovery in the monthly customer service charge 
this rate design mitigates most weather risk as well as the effects of declining usage  similar to the company s lost margin recovery mechanism in place in the indiana natural gas service territories and the mechanism in place in ohio prior to this rate order 
since the straight fixed variable rate design was fully implemented for residential base rates in february  nearly percent of the combined residential and commercial base rate gas margins were recovered through the customer service charge 
as a result  some margin previously recovered during the peak delivery winter months  such as january and the first half of february  is more ratably recognized throughout the year 
vedo continues the process to exit the merchant function on april   the puco issued an order which approved the first two phases of a three phase plan to exit the merchant function in the company ohio service territory 
as a result  substantially all of the company ohio customers now purchase natural gas directly from retail gas marketers rather than from the company 
the puco provided for an exit transition cost rider  which allows the company to recover costs associated with the first two phases of the transition process 
exiting the merchant function has not had a material impact on earnings or financial condition 
it  however  has and will continue to reduce gas utility revenues and have an equal and offsetting impact to cost of gas sold as vedo  for the most part  no longer purchases gas for resale 
vedo s gas costs in were million  and were insignificant in and the decreases in gas costs were offset by similar decreases in revenues 
environmental matters the company utility operations and properties are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal  state and municipal laws and regulations 
these environmental regulations impose  among other things  restrictions  liabilities  and obligations in connection with the storage  transportation  treatment  and disposal of hazardous substances and limit airborne emissions from electric generating facilities including particulate matter  sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxide nox  and mercury  among others 
environmental legislation regulation also requires that facilities  sites  and other properties associated with the company operations be operated  maintained  abandoned  and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 
the company current costs to comply with these laws and regulations are significant to its results of operations and financial condition 
with the trend toward stricter standards  greater regulation  and more extensive permit requirements  the company investment in compliant infrastructure  and the associated operating costs have increased and are expected to increase in the future 
similar to the costs associated with federal mandates in the pipeline safety law  indiana senate bill is also applicable to federal environmental mandates impacting vectren south electric operations 
the company is currently evaluating the impact senate bill may have on its operations  including applicability to the stricter regulations the epa is currently considering involving air quality  fly ash disposal  cooling tower intake facilities  waste water discharges  and greenhouse gases 
these issues are further discussed below 
air quality clean air interstate rule cross state air pollution rule in july  the epa finalized the cross state air pollution rule csapr 
csapr was the epa s response to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia s the court remand of the clean air interstate rule cair 
cair was originally established in as an allowance cap and trade program that required reductions from coal burning power plants for nox emissions beginning january  and so emissions beginning january   with a second phase of reductions in in an effort to address the court s finding that cair did not adequately ensure attainment of pollutants in certain downwind states due to unlimited trading of so 

and nox allowances  csapr reduced the ability of facilities to meet emission reduction targets through allowance trading 
like cair  csapr set individual state caps for so 

and nox emissions 
however  unlike cair in which states allocated allowances to generating units through state implementation plans  csapr allowances were allocated to individual units directly through the federal rule 
csapr reductions were to be achieved with initial step reductions beginning january   and final compliance to be achieved in multiple administrative and judicial challenges were filed 
on december   the court granted a stay of csapr and left cair in place pending its review 
on august   the court vacated csapr and directed the epa to continue to administer cair 
in october  the epa filed its request for a hearing before the full federal appeals court that struck down the csapr 
epa request for rehearing was denied by the court on january  the company remains in full compliance with cair see additional information below conclusions regarding air regulations 
mercury and air toxics mats rule on december   the epa finalized the utility mats rule 
the mats rule is the epa s response to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia vacating the clean air mercury rule camr in camr was originally established in as a nation wide mercury emission allowance cap and trade system which sought to reduce utility emissions of mercury starting in the mats rule sets emission limits for hazardous air pollutants for existing and new coal fired power plants and identifies the following broad categories of hazardous air pollutants mercury  non mercury hazardous air pollutants primarily arsenic  chromium  cobalt  and selenium  and acid gases hydrogen cyanide  hydrogen chloride  and hydrogen fluoride 
the rule imposes mercury emission limits for two sub categories of coal  and proposed surrogate limits for non mercury and acid gas hazardous air pollutants 
the epa did not grant blanket compliance extensions  but asserted that states have broad authority to grant one year extensions for individual units where potential reliability impacts have been demonstrated 
reductions are to be achieved within three years of publication of the final rule in the federal register april 
initiatives to suspend csapr s implementation by the congress also apply to the implementation of the mats rule 
multiple judicial challenges were filed and briefing is proceeding 
the epa also recently announced it will reconsider mats requirements for new construction 
such requirements are more stringent than those for existing plants 
utilities planning new coal fired generation had argued standards outlined in the mats could not be attained even using the best available control technology 
conclusions regarding air regulations to comply with indiana s implementation plan of the clean air act  and other federal air quality standards  the company obtained authority from the iurc to invest in clean coal technology 
using this authorization  the company invested approximately million starting in with the last equipment being placed into service on january  the pollution control equipment included selective catalytic reduction scr systems  fabric filters  and an so scrubber at its generating facility that is jointly owned with alcoa the company s portion is mw 
scr technology is the most effective method of reducing nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required and fabric filters control particulate matter emissions 
the unamortized portion of the million clean coal technology investment was included in rate base for purposes of determining sigeco s new electric base rates approved in the latest base rate order obtained april  sigeco s coal fired generating fleet is percent scrubbed for so and percent controlled for nox 
utilization of the company s nox and so allowances can be impacted as regulations are revised and implemented 
most of these allowances were granted to the company at zero cost  therefore  any reduction in carrying value that could result from future changes in regulations would be immaterial 
the company is currently reviewing the sufficiency of its existing pollution control equipment in relation to the requirements described in the mats rule and the requirement imposed by cair 
based upon an initial review  the company believes that it will be able to meet these requirements with its existing suite of pollution control equipment 
however  it is possible some operational modifications to the control equipment will be required 
additional capital investments  operating expenses  and possibly the purchase of emission allowances may be required and could be significant depending on the required method of compliance with the requirements 
while the company has not yet quantified what the additional costs may be associated with these efforts  because the compliance is required by government regulation the company believes that such additional costs  if incurred  should be recoverable under indiana senate bill referenced above 
notice of violation received the company received a notice of violation nov from the epa in november pertaining to its ab brown power plant 
the nov asserts that when the power plant was equipped with scrs the correct permits were not obtained or the best available control technology to control incidental sulfuric acid mist was not installed 
based on the company s understanding of the new source review reform in effect when the equipment was installed  it is the company s position that its scr project was exempted from such requirements 
at this time the company is reviewing the potential impact this nov could have on capital expenditures and operating costs 
to the extent costs to comply increase  they should be recoverable under indiana law 
water section b of the clean water act requires that generating facilities use the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts in a body of water 
more specifically  section b is concerned with impingement and entrainment of aquatic species in once through cooling water intake structures used at electric generating facilities 
in april  the us supreme court affirmed that the epa could  but was not required to  consider costs and benefits in making the evaluation as to the best technology available for existing generating facilities 
the regulation was remanded back to the epa for further consideration 
in march  the epa released its proposed section b regulations 
the epa did not mandate the retrofitting of cooling towers in the proposed regulation  but if finalized  the regulation will leave it to the state to determine whether cooling towers should be required on a case by case basis 
a final rule is expected in depending on the final rule and on the company s facts and circumstances  capital investments could approximate million if new infrastructure  such as new cooling water towers  is required 
costs for compliance with these final regulations should qualify as federally mandated regulatory requirements and be recovered under indiana senate bill referenced above 
under the clean water act  epa sets technology based guidelines for water discharges from new and existing facilities 
epa is currently in the process of revising the existing steam electric effluent limitation guidelines that set the technology based water discharge limits for the electric power industry 
epa is focusing its rulemaking on wastewater generated primarily by pollution control equipment necessitated by the comprehensive air regulations 
epa is under an april  deadline to complete its rule proposal 
it is not possible to estimate what potential costs may be required to meet these new water discharge limits  however costs for compliance with these regulations should qualify as federally mandated regulatory requirements and be recovered under senate bill referenced above 
coal ash waste disposal ash ponds in june  the epa issued proposed regulations affecting the management and disposal of coal combustion products  such as ash generated by the company s coal fired power plants 
the proposed rules more stringently regulate these byproducts and would likely increase the cost of operating or expanding existing ash ponds and the development of new ash ponds 
the alternatives include regulating coal combustion by products that are not being beneficially reused as hazardous waste 
the epa did not offer a preferred alternative  but took public comment on multiple alternative regulations 
rules have not been finalized given oversight hearings  congressional interest  and other factors 
at this time  the majority of the company s ash is being beneficially reused 
however  the alternatives proposed would require modification to  or closure of  existing ash ponds 
the company estimates capital expenditures to comply could be as much as million  and such expenditures could exceed million if the most stringent of the alternatives is selected 
annual compliance costs could increase slightly or be impacted by as much as million 
costs for compliance with these regulations should qualify as federally mandated regulatory requirements and be recovered under senate bill referenced above 
climate change vectren is committed to responsible environmental stewardship and conservation efforts and if a national climate change policy is implemented believes it should have the following elements an inclusive scope that involves all sectors of the economy and sources of greenhouse gases  and recognizes early actions and investments made to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions  provisions for enhanced use of renewable energy sources as a supplement to base load coal generation including effective energy conservation  demand side management  and generation efficiency measures  inclusion of incentives for investment in advanced clean coal technology and support for research and development  and a strategy supporting alternative energy technologies and biofuels and continued increase in the domestic supply of natural gas to reduce dependence on foreign oil 
the company emits greenhouse gases ghg primarily from its fossil fuel electric generation plants 
the company uses the methodology described in the acid rain program under title iv of the clean air act to calculate its level of direct co emissions from its fossil fuel electric generating plants 
the company s direct co 

emissions from its plants over the past years are represented below in thousands direct co emissions tons based on data made available through the electronic greenhouse gas reporting tool e grrt maintained by the epa  the company s direct co emissions from its fossil fuel electric generation that report under the acid rain program were less than one half of one percent of all emissions in the united states from similar sources 
emissions from other company operations  including those from its natural gas distribution operations and the greenhouse gas emissions the company is required to report on behalf of its end use customers  are similarly available through the epa s e grrt database and reporting tool 
current initiatives to increase conservation reduce emissions the company is committed to a policy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy usage 
evidence of this commitment includes focusing the company s mission statement and purpose on corporate sustainability and the need to help customers conserve and manage energy costs  building a renewable energy portfolio to complement base load coal fired generation in advance of mandated renewable energy portfolio standards  implementing conservation initiatives in the company s indiana and ohio gas utility service territories  implementing conservation and demand side management initiatives in the electric service territory  evaluating potential carbon requirements with regard to new generation  other fuel supply sources  and future environmental compliance plans  reducing the company s carbon footprint by measures such as utilizing hybrid vehicles and optimizing generation efficiencies by utilizing dense pack technology  and developing renewable energy and energy efficiency performance contracting projects through its wholly owned subsidiary  energy systems group 
legislative actions other climate change initiatives in april  the us supreme court determined that greenhouse gases meet the definition of air pollutant under the clean air act and ordered the epa to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare 
in april  the epa published its proposed endangerment finding for public comment 
the proposed endangerment finding concludes that carbon emissions from mobile sources pose an endangerment to public health and the environment 
the endangerment finding was finalized in december  and is the first step toward epa regulating carbon emissions through the existing clean air act in the absence of specific carbon legislation from congress 
the epa has promulgated two greenhouse gas regulations that apply to the company s generating facilities 
in  the epa finalized a mandatory greenhouse gas emissions registry which requires the reporting of emissions 
the epa has also finalized a revision to the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permitting rules which would require facilities that emit  tons or more of greenhouse gases a year to obtain a psd permit for new construction or a significant modification of an existing facility 
epa psd and title v permitting rules for ghg were recently upheld by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia 
in  the epa proposed new source performance standards for greenhouse gases for new electric generating facilities under clean air act section b 
while standards for new sources are not yet final  epa has signaled its intent to propose new source performance standards for greenhouse gases for existing electric generating units under section d  which would be applicable to the company existing units 
the company anticipates that these initial standards will focus on power plant efficiency and other coal fleet carbon intensity reduction measures 
the company believes that such additional costs  if necessary  should be recoverable under indiana senate bill referenced above 
numerous competing federal legislative proposals have also been introduced in recent years that involve carbon  energy efficiency  and renewable energy 
comprehensive energy legislation at the federal level continues to be debated  but there has been little progress to date 
the progression of regional initiatives throughout the united states has also slowed 
impact of legislative actions other initiatives is unknown if regulations are enacted by the epa or other agencies or if legislation requiring reductions in co and other greenhouse gases or legislation mandating a renewable energy portfolio standard is adopted  such regulation could substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of the company s fossil fuel generating plants  nonutility coal mining operations  and natural gas distribution businesses 
at this time and in the absence of final legislation or rulemaking  compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain 
the company has gathered preliminary estimates of the costs to control greenhouse gas emissions 
a preliminary investigation demonstrated costs to comply would be significant  first with regard to operating expenses and later for capital expenditures as technology becomes available to control greenhouse gas emissions 
however  these compliance cost estimates are based on highly uncertain assumptions  including allowance prices if a cap and trade approach were employed  and energy efficiency targets 
costs to purchase allowances that cap greenhouse gas emissions or expenditures made to control emissions should be considered a cost of providing electricity  and as such  the company believes such costs and expenditures should be recoverable from customers through senate bill senate bill also established a voluntary clean energy portfolio standard that provides incentives to electricity suppliers participating in the program 
the goal of the program is that by  at least percent of the total electricity obtained by the supplier to meet the energy needs of indiana retail customers will be provided by clean energy sources  as defined 
the financial incentives include an enhanced return on equity and tracking mechanisms to recover program costs 
in advance of a federal portfolio standard and senate bill  sigeco received regulatory approval to purchase a mw landfill gas generation facility from a related entity 
the facility was purchased in and is directly connected to the company distribution system 
in  the company also executed a long term purchase power commitment for mw of wind energy 
these transactions supplement a mw wind energy purchase power agreement executed in before the impacts of efficiency measures which are defined as clean energy in the legislation  the company currently has approximately percent of its electricity being provided by clean energy sources due to the long term wind contracts and landfill gas investment 
the company continues to evaluate whether to participate in this voluntary program 
manufactured gas plants in the past  the company operated facilities to manufacture natural gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under current environmental laws and regulations  those that owned or operated these facilities may now be required to take remedial action if certain contaminants are found above the regulatory thresholds 
in the indiana gas service territory  the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites have been identified for which the company may have some remedial responsibility 
a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs was completed at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january the remaining sites have been submitted to the idem voluntary remediation program vrp 
the company has identified its involvement in five manufactured gas plant sites in sigeco s service territory  all of which are currently enrolled in the idem s vrp 
the company is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites 
the company has accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  the company has recorded cumulative costs that it has incurred or reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million million at indiana gas and million at sigeco 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to the company s share of the remediation efforts and are therefore net of exposures of other potentially responsible parties prp 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has received approximately million from all known insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these plants were in operation 
likewise  sigeco has settlement agreements with all known insurance carriers and has received to date approximately million of the expected million in insurance recoveries 
the costs the company expects to incur are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred  the timing of expected future payments  and inflation factors  among others 
while the company s utilities have recorded all costs which they presently expect to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require remedial activities which are not presently foreseen and those costs may not be subject to prp or insurance recovery 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of accrued  but not yet spent  costs are included in other liabilities related to both the indiana gas and sigeco sites 
results of operations of the nonutility group the nonutility group operates in four primary business areas infrastructure services  energy services  coal mining  and energy marketing 
infrastructure services provides underground pipeline construction and repair services 
energy services provides performance contracting and renewable energy services 
coal mining owns mines and sells coal 
energy marketing markets and supplies natural gas and provides energy management services 
there are also other legacy businesses that have invested in energy related opportunities and services  real estate  and a leveraged lease  among other investments 
pursuant to service contracts  the nonutility group provides the company s regulated utilities natural gas supply services  coal  and infrastructure services 
nonutility group earnings for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share amounts net income contribution to vectren basic eps net income loss attributed to infrastructure services energy services coal mining energy marketing vectren source proliance other businesses infrastructure services infrastructure services provides underground pipeline construction and repair services through wholly owned subsidiaries miller pipeline miller and minnesota limited  inc minnesota limited which was acquired on march  inclusive of holding company costs  earnings from infrastructure services operations for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in the increases in earnings reflect increased demand across all infrastructure business areas 
results in were further favorably impacted by warm  dry weather resulting in favorable construction conditions 
for the nine months owned in  minnesota limited contributed earnings of million 
the remainder of the increase in compared to  totaling million  relates to miller s ongoing operations 
revenues in were million  compared to revenues in of million  including million from minnesota limited prior to its acquisition 
infrastructure services revenues in totaled million 
construction activity generally is expected to remain strong as utilities and pipeline operators replace their aging natural gas and oil pipeline infrastructure and due to the continued strong demand for shale gas and oil infrastructure 
as an example  in the fourth quarter of  infrastructure services was awarded a contract to construct an approximately mile natural gas pipeline in the bakken shale area of north dakota 
it is expected this work will be completed by the end of the second quarter of acquisition of minnesota limited on march   the company purchased minnesota limited  excluding certain assets 
minnesota limited is a specialty contractor focusing on natural gas and oil transmission pipeline construction and maintenance  pump station  compressor station  terminal and refinery construction  and hydrostatic testing 
minnesota limited is headquartered in big lake  minnesota and the majority of its customers are generally located in the northern midwest region 
the purchase price was approximately million and included million of net working capital  million of property plant and equipment and million of intangible assets  including goodwill 
energy services energy services provides energy performance contracting and renewable energy services through energy systems group  llc esg 
inclusive of holding company costs  energy services operations contributed earnings of million in  compared to million in and million in results in reflect reduced revenues  which indicate a slowing in demand for performance contracting projects due primarily to current budgetary constraints on municipal and school customers  and increased operating expenses associated with an increase in the sales force incurred throughout and the impact of energy efficiency building tax deductions from qualifying projects on earnings offset the reduced revenues and higher operating expenses  and resulted in earnings comparable to the increase in earnings in compared to reflects increased revenues 
esg continues to add to its employee base and footprint to position it for long term growth in this sector as the national focus on energy conservation  renewable energy  and sustainability is expected to continue longer term  given the expected rise in power prices across the country as utilities increase rates to recover expected increased environmental expenditures and other federally mandated costs 
as of december   performance contracting backlog was million  compared to million at december  and million at december  esg placed three build and own anaerobic digester projects into service in coal mining coal mining owns mines that produce and sell coal to the company s utility operations and to third parties through its wholly owned subsidiary vectren fuels  inc vectren fuels 
results from coal mining  inclusive of holding company costs  were a loss of million in  compared to earnings of million in and million in results were lower in due to lower tons sold and reduced pricing for customers associated with contracts that had price reopener clauses 
tons sold in were unfavorably impacted by the low cost of natural gas and mild winter weather 
these factors significantly reduced the demand for illinois basin coal and led to a more than percent reduction in volumes sold compared to coal sales in were million tons  compared to million tons in and million tons in during  the company reduced production in order to better match the lower demand 
production at these lower than optimal levels significantly increased the cost per ton mined at both the oaktown and prosperity mining complexes 
at normal production levels  the oaktown cost environment remains favorable  however  at prosperity a thin coal seam and other unfavorable mining conditions continue to have a negative impact on production costs 
coal mining revenues were million in  million in  and million in the increase in revenues in reflects increased sales to third parties as a result of opening oaktown in revenues from oaktown more than offset lost revenues from the cypress creek surface mine which closed in with only limited production 
vectren fuels expected production is approximately million tons in coal sales in are estimated at million tons 
the impact of continued reduced demand for coal generally  and its impact on price  is expected to result in a greater loss from coal mining operations in compared to the development of the second mine at the company oaktown mining complex was substantially completed in but is not expected to begin production until demand for its coal increases 
longer term  the company continues to believe that reduced coal volumes available from central appalachia due to increased regulation and the large number of scrubbers to be installed throughout the united states  including the midwest  coupled with moderate increases in natural gas prices from the very low levels experienced in  should drive stronger demand for illinois basin coal 
changes in market conditions or other circumstances could cause actual results to be materially different from these expectations 
coal reserves as of december   management estimates the company s total illinois basin coal reserves to be approximately million tons 
of this amount  approximately million tons are attributable to the second mine at the company oaktown mining complex 
once this mine is in production  vectren fuels three underground mines are capable of producing about million tons of coal per year 
energy marketing proliance proliance  a nonutility energy marketing affiliate of vectren and citizens  provides services to a broad range of municipalities  utilities  industrial operations  schools  and healthcare institutions located throughout the midwest and southeast united states 
proliance s customers include vectren s indiana utilities and citizens utilities 
proliance s primary businesses include gas marketing  gas portfolio optimization  and other portfolio and energy management services 
consistent with its ownership percentage  vectren is allocated percent of proliance s profits and losses  however  governance and voting rights remain at percent for each member 
the company accounts for its investment in proliance using the equity method of accounting 
on march   an order was received from the iurc providing for proliance s continued provision of gas supply services to the company s indiana utilities and citizens energy group through march vectren energy marketing and services  inc ems  a wholly owned subsidiary  holds the company s investment in proliance 
ems is responsible for certain financing costs associated with proliance and is also responsible for income taxes and allocated corporate expenses related to the company s portion of proliance s results 
during the year ended december   ems results related to the company s share of proliance s losses  which include financing costs  income taxes  and other holding company costs  were a loss of million  compared to a loss of million in and a loss of million in the smaller loss in primarily reflects the reduction in fixed demand costs for both storage and transportation contracts and lower general and administrative expenses 
the million increased loss in compared to reflects new natural gas sources from shale and greater transmission capacity  as well as lower industrial demand for natural gas in the midwest compared to prior years 
these conditions have resulted in plentiful natural gas supply and lower and less volatile natural gas prices 
historical basis differences between physical and financial markets and summer and winter prices narrowed in as a result  there were  and continue to be  reduced opportunities to optimize proliance s firm transportation and storage capacity 
efforts to lower the cost of pipeline and storage demand costs continue 
through negotiations and by dropping some uneconomical contracts as they expire  proliance has lowered its pipeline transportation and storage costs to approximately million for  compared to million in and million in the projected annual demand costs in are expected to be approximately million  or approximately million lower than in addition to these reductions  opportunities exist to renegotiate or drop contracts with annual demand costs of approximately million by the end of changes in market conditions or other circumstances could cause actual demand costs to be materially different from this expectation 
at december   proliance had approximately million of members equity on its balance sheet  no long term debt outstanding  and borrowings to support working capital of million on its million credit facility  which became effective in may for a two year period 
for the year ended december   the amounts recorded to equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates related to proliance s operations totaled a pre tax loss of million  compared to a loss of million in and a loss of million in at the time of the sale of vectren source  the company stated that its future emphasis in the nonutility group would be on growing its infrastructure and energy services businesses rather than its commodities businesses 
the company continues to evaluate and assess strategic alternatives related to the investment in its energy marketing affiliate  proliance holdings 
the company believes the carrying value of its investment in proliance holdings at december  is appropriate  based upon projections and other valuation data received from proliance 
if the company  however  proceeds with one of the strategic alternatives being evaluated  which could include a disposition of its investment in proliance holdings or a disposition by proliance holdings of one or more of its operating subsidiaries or their assets  the amount realized could be materially below the carrying value of the company investment of million 
in such event  the company would record such loss as equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates 
investment in liberty gas storage liberty gas storage  llc liberty  a joint venture between a subsidiary of proliance and a subsidiary of sempra energy se  is a development project for salt cavern natural gas storage facilities 
proliance is the minority member with a percent interest  which it accounts for using the equity method 
the project was expected to include bcf of capacity in its north site  and an additional capacity of at least bcf at the south site 
the south site also has the potential for further expansion 
the liberty pipeline system is currently connected with several interstate pipelines  including the cameron interstate pipeline operated by sempra pipelines storage  and will connect area lng regasification terminals to an interstate natural gas transmission system and storage facilities 
in late  the project at the north site was halted due to subsurface and well completion problems  which resulted in liberty recording a million impairment charge 
the company  through proliance  recorded its share of the charge in as a result of the issues encountered at the north site  liberty requested and the ferc approved the separation of the north site from the south site 
approximately bcf of the storage at the south site  which comprises three of the four ferc certified caverns  is fully tested but additional work is required to connect the caverns to the pipeline system 
proliance investment in liberty is approximately million 
liberty received a demand for arbitration from williams midstream natural gas liquids  inc williams on february  related to a sublease agreement sublease between liberty and williams at the north site 
williams alleges that liberty was negligent in its attempt to convert certain salt caverns to natural gas storage and thereby damaged the caverns 
williams alleges damages of million 
liberty believes that it has complied with all of its obligations to williams  including properly terminating the sublease 
liberty intends to vigorously defend itself and has asserted counterclaims substantially in excess of the amounts asserted by williams 
as such  as of december   proliance has no material reserve recorded related to this matter and this litigation has not materially impacted proliance results of operations or statement of financial position 
vectren source vectren source  a former wholly owned subsidiary  provided natural gas and other related products and services to customers opting for choice among energy providers 
on december   the company sold vectren source receiving proceeds of approximately million  excluding minor working capital adjustments recorded in the sale  net of transaction costs  resulted in a pretax gain included in other operating expenses of million  or million after all associated tax impacts 
vedo continues doing business with the third party purchaser of vectren source 
this third party continues to sell natural gas directly to customers in vedo s service territory  and vedo purchases receivables and natural gas from the third party 
prior to the sale  vectren source earned million in  compared to million in other businesses within the nonutility business segment  there are legacy investments involved in energy related opportunities and services  real estate  a leveraged lease  and other ventures 
as of december   remaining legacy investments included in the other businesses portfolio total million  of which million are included in other nonutility investments and million are included in investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the investment is made up of the following commercial real estate  million  a leveraged lease  million million net of related deferred taxes  and other investments  million 
net of the deferred taxes  the net investment associated with these legacy investments at december  was million 
other businesses losses were million in  compared to a loss of million in and a loss of million in results in include charges totaling million after tax associated with legacy real estate holdings 
results in and reflect after tax charges of million and million  respectively  related to the carrying value of an energy related investment originally made in by haddington energy partners 
in addition to the haddington related charges  results in include a million after tax charge related to the reduction in value of a receivable recorded in related to a previously exited business 
haddington energy partnerships the company has an approximate percent ownership interest in haddington energy partners  lp haddington i and haddington energy partners ii  lp haddington ii  which are accounted for using the equity method 
inclusive of pre tax charges recorded in of million and in of million associated with remaining investments  the company net carrying value is zero at december  as the haddington operations are nearing completion  the approximate million invested in these partnerships since inception in the early s generated a return of percent  exclusive of taxes and management fees 
the company has no further commitments to invest in either haddington i or ii 
impact of recently issued accounting guidance other comprehensive income oci in  the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income within financial statements 
the new guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the income statement format used today  and the second statement would include components of oci 
the guidance does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and retrospective application is required 
the company adopted this guidance  as amended for condensed quarterly reporting  for the quarterly reporting period ended march  by reporting comprehensive income as required 
goodwill testing in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance allows the company an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
using the new guidance  the company no longer would be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the company considered this option during its quarterly reporting period ended march  and concluded the continuation of the use of a quantitative approach is appropriate 
fair value measurement and disclosure in may  the fasb issued accounting guidance to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments are not intended to change the application of the current fair value requirements  but to clarify the application of existing requirements 
the guidance does change particular principles or requirements for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements 
to improve consistency  language has been changed to ensure that us gaap and ifrs fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way 
the company adopted this guidance for its quarterly reporting period ended march  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in their preparation 
certain estimates are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates related to the effects of regulation that are critical to the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciating utility and nonutility plant  valuing reclamation liabilities  and estimating uncollectible accounts  unbilled revenues  deferred income taxes  and coal reserves  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment review of investments and long lived assets the company has both debt and equity investments in unconsolidated entities 
when events occur that may cause an investment to be impaired  the company performs both a qualitative and quantitative review of that investment and when necessary performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or in certain cases for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value  to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of equity investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount and an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is other than temporary 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analysis 
property  plant and equipment along with other long lived assets are reviewed as facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
this impairment review involves the comparison of an asset s or group of assets carrying value to the estimated future cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate over a remaining life 
if this evaluation were to conclude that the carrying value is impaired  an impairment charge would be recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell for assets to be disposed of by sale 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations  among others 
over the year s presented  the company has recorded charges associated with legacy commercial real estate and other investments using the methods described above 
related to the company owned coal mines  an undiscounted cash flow analysis was performed during supporting the carrying amount of each coal mine 
however  should market conditions worsen  impairments affecting these and other assets could result and actual realized values could differ from the current carrying values 
goodwill intangible assets the company performs an annual impairment analysis of its goodwill  most of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment  at the beginning of each year  and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements to be the level at which impairment is tested as its components are similar 
nonutility group impairment testing for its infrastructure services and energy services segments are also performed at the operating segment level 
an impairment test requires fair value to be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model and other market based information to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
goodwill related to the nonutility group is also tested using market comparable data  if readily available  or a discounted cash flow model 
the estimated fair value has been substantially in excess of the carrying amount in each of the last three years and therefore resulted in no impairment 
estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge 
the company also annually tests non amortizing intangible assets for impairment and amortizing intangible assets are tested on an event and circumstance basis 
during the last three years  these tests yielded no impairment charges 
pension other postretirement obligations the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  and future health care costs  among other inputs  and obtains actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company pension and postretirement plans 
the company used the following weighted average assumptions to develop periodic benefit cost a discount rate of approximately percent  an expected return on plan assets of percent  a rate of compensation increase of percent  and an inflation assumption of percent 
due to low interest rates  the discount rate is basis points lower from the assumption used in the rate of return and inflation rates were also lowered basis points 
to estimate costs  the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and inflation assumption were approximately percent  percent  percent  and percent respectively  reflecting the further reductions in interest rates 
management currently estimates a pension and postretirement cost of approximately million in future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  asset values or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits 
management estimates that a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to estimate retirement costs generally increases periodic benefit cost by approximately million to million 
however  the impact of increases associated with a lower discount rate are partially offset by the impact of plan contributions and a plan amendment related to the postretirement medical plan 
regulation at each reporting date  the company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates 
this review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in fasb guidance related to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
based on the company s current review  it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
if all or part of the company operations cease to meet the criteria  a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets and liabilities 
in the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment  such write offs and impairment charges could be significant 
financial condition within vectren s consolidated group  utility holdings primarily funds the short term and long term financing needs of the utility group operations  and vectren capital corp vectren capital funds short term and long term financing needs of the nonutility group and corporate operations 
vectren corporation guarantees vectren capital s debt  but does not guarantee utility holdings debt 
vectren capital s long term debt and short term obligations outstanding at december  approximated million and million  respectively 
utility holdings outstanding long term and short term borrowing arrangements are jointly and severally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiaries and regulated utilities indiana gas  sigeco  and vedo 
utility holdings long term debt  including current maturities  and short term obligations outstanding at december  approximated million and million  respectively 
additionally  prior to utility holdings formation  indiana gas and sigeco funded their operations separately  and therefore  have long term debt outstanding funded solely by their operations 
sigeco will also occasionally issue tax exempt debt to fund qualifying pollution control capital expenditures 
total indiana gas and sigeco long term debt  including current maturities  outstanding at december   was million 
the company s common stock dividends are primarily funded by utility operations 
nonutility operations have demonstrated profitability and the ability to generate cash flows 
these cash flows are primarily reinvested in other nonutility ventures  but are also used to fund a portion of the company s dividends  and from time to time may be reinvested in utility operations or used for corporate expenses 
the credit ratings of the senior unsecured debt of utility holdings and indiana gas  at december   are a a as rated by standard and poor ratings services standard and poor s and moody s investors service moody s  respectively 
the credit ratings on sigeco secured debt are a a utility holdings commercial paper has a credit rating of a p the current outlook of both moody s and standard and poor s is stable 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities 
the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
standard and poor s and moody s lowest level investment grade rating is bbb and baa  respectively 
the company s consolidated equity capitalization objective is percent of long term capitalization 
this objective may have varied  and will vary  depending on particular business opportunities  capital spending requirements  execution of long term financing plans  and seasonal factors that affect the company s operations 
the company s equity component was percent and percent of long term capitalization at december  and  respectively 
long term capitalization includes long term debt  including current maturities  as well as common shareholders equity 
both long term and short term borrowing arrangements contain customary default provisions  restrictions on liens  sale leaseback transactions  mergers or consolidations  and sales of assets  and restrictions on leverage  among other restrictions 
multiple debt agreements contain a covenant that the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization will not exceed percent 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
available liquidity in current credit conditions the company a a investment grade credit ratings have allowed it to access the capital markets as needed  and the company believes it will have the ability to continue to do so 
given the company intent to maintain a balanced long term capitalization ratio  it anticipates funding future capital expenditures and dividends principally through internally generated funds  which have recently been enhanced by bonus depreciation legislation  and refinancing maturing debt using the capital markets 
however  the resources required for capital investment remain uncertain for a variety of factors including pending legislative and regulatory initiatives involving gas pipeline infrastructure replacement  coal mine safety  expanded epa regulations for air  water  and fly ash  and growth of infrastructure services and energy services 
these regulations may result in the need to raise additional capital in the coming years 
in addition  the company may expand its businesses through acquisitions and or joint venture investment 
the timing and amount of such investments depends on a variety of factors  including the availability of acquisition targets and available liquidity 
the company may also consider disposing of certain assets  investments  or businesses to enhance or accelerate internally generated cash flow 
specifically for  the company plans to access the capital markets to refinance debt maturities or debt that is callable 
the company currently has firm commitments for a debt issuance totaling million which is more fully described below 
long term debt transactions completed in   and include issuances by vectren capital totaling million and issuances by vectren utility holdings totaling million 
these transactions are more fully described below 
see financing cash flow 
consolidated short term borrowing arrangements at december   the company has million of short term borrowing capacity  including million for the utility group and million for the wholly owned nonutility group and corporate operations 
as reduced by borrowings currently outstanding  approximately million was available for the utility group operations and approximately million was available for the wholly owned nonutility group and corporate operations 
both vectren capital s and utility holdings short term credit facilities were renewed in november and are available through september the maximum limit of both facilities remained unchanged 
these facilities are used to supplement working capital needs and also to fund capital investments and debt redemptions until financed on a long term basis 
the company has historically funded the short term borrowing needs of utility holdings operations through the commercial paper market and expects to use the utility holdings short term borrowing facility in instances where the commercial paper market is not efficient 
following is certain information regarding these short term borrowing arrangements 
utility group borrowings nonutility group borrowings in millions year end balance outstanding weighted average interest rate annual average balance outstanding weighted average interest rate maximum month end balance outstanding throughout   and  utility holdings has placed commercial paper without any significant issues and did not borrow from its backup credit facility in any of these periods 
proliance short term borrowing arrangements proliance  a nonutility energy marketing affiliate of the company  has separate borrowing capacity available through a syndicated credit facility 
on may   proliance entered into a two year asset based credit facility with a total capacity of million 
the level of capacity is also subject to outstanding letters of credit and current inventory and receivable balances 
as of december   approximately million in borrowings were outstanding 
the facility is not guaranteed by vectren or citizens 
new share issues the company may periodically issue new common shares to satisfy the dividend reinvestment plan  stock option plan and other employee benefit plan requirements 
new issuances added additional liquidity of million in  million in  and million in potential uses of liquidity pension postretirement funding obligations as of december   assets related to the company s qualified pension plans were approximately percent of the projected benefit obligation on a gaap basis and percent of the target liability for erisa purposes 
management currently estimates contributing approximately million to qualified pension plans in corporate guarantees the company issues parent level guarantees to certain vendors and customers of its wholly owned subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 
these guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations  rather  they represent parental guarantees of subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate obligations in order to allow those subsidiaries and affiliates the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral 
at december   parent level guarantees support a maximum of million of esg s performance contracting commitments and warranty obligations and million of other project guarantees 
the broader scope of esg s performance contracting obligations  including those not guaranteed by the parent company  are described below 
in addition  the parent company has approximately million of other guarantees outstanding supporting other consolidated subsidiary operations  of which million represent letters of credit supporting other nonutility operations 
guarantees issued and outstanding on behalf of unconsolidated affiliates approximated million at december  these guarantees relate primarily to arrangements between proliance and various natural gas pipeline operators 
the company has not been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees and has accrued no significant liabilities related to these guarantees 
performance guarantees product warranties in the normal course of business  wholly owned subsidiaries  including esg  issue performance bonds or other forms of assurance that commit them to timely install infrastructure  operate facilities  pay vendors or subcontractors  and or support warranty obligations 
based on a history of meeting performance obligations and installed products operating effectively  no significant liability or cost has been recognized for the periods presented 
specific to esg  in its role as a general contractor in the performance contracting industry  at december   there are open surety bonds supporting future performance 
the average face amount of these obligations is million  and the largest obligation has a face amount of million 
the maximum exposure from these obligations is limited by the level of work already completed and guarantees issued to esg by various subcontractors 
at december   approximately percent of work was completed on projects with open surety bonds 
a significant portion of these open surety bonds will be released within one year 
in instances where esg operates facilities  project guarantees extend over a longer period 
in addition to its performance obligations  esg also warrants the functionality of certain installed infrastructure generally for one year and the associated energy savings over a specified number of years 
the company has no significant accruals for these warranty obligations as of december  in addition  esg has an million stand alone letter of credit facility and as of december   million was outstanding 
planned capital expenditures investments during capital expenditures and other investments approximated million  of which approximately million related to utility group expenditures 
this compares to where consolidated investments were approximately million with million attributed to the utility group and where consolidated investments were approximately million with million attributed to the utility group 
planned utility group capital expenditures  including contractual purchase commitments  for the five year period are expected to total approximately in millions     and  respectively 
this plan contains the best estimate of the resources required for known regulatory compliance  however  many environmental and pipeline safety standards are subject to change in the near term 
such changes could materially impact planned capital expenditures 
planned nonutility group capital expenditures for mine development and recurring infrastructure investments  including contractual purchase commitments  for the five year period are expected to total in millions     and  respectively 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of contractual obligations at december  in millions total thereafter long term debt short term debt long term debt interest commitments nonutility commodity purchase commitments plant and nonutility plant purchase commitments operating leases total the debt due in is comprised of debt issued by vectren utility holdings totaling million  million issued by indiana gas  and million associated with the company s nonutility operations 
the company expects that the majority of this debt maturing in will be refinanced using the long term debt capital markets 
the company has other long term liabilities that total approximately million 
this amount is comprised of the following pension obligations million  postretirement obligations million  deferred compensation and share based compensation obligations million  asset retirement obligations million  investment tax credits million  environmental remediation obligations million  and other obligations including unrecognized tax benefits totaling million 
based on the nature of these items  their expected settlement dates cannot be estimated 
the company s regulated utilities have both firm and non firm commitments to purchase natural gas  electricity  and coal as well as certain transportation and storage rights 
costs arising from these commitments  while significant  are pass through costs  generally collected dollar for dollar from retail customers through regulator approved cost recovery mechanisms 
because of the pass through nature of these costs  they have not been included in the listing of contractual obligations 
comparison of historical sources uses of liquidity operating cash flow the company primary source of liquidity to fund capital requirements has been cash generated from operations  which totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the million decrease in operating cash flow in compared to is primarily due to greater working capital needs to support growth in the infrastructure services segment and lower cash generated by the coal mining segment 
the deferral for future recovery of certain coal costs pursuant to a regulatory order is the primary use of cash impacting the change in noncurrent assets 
increased earnings overall  along with lower contributions to employee benefit plans in  somewhat offset these decreases 
in  operating cash flows increased million compared to this increase was primarily due to a much greater level of cash utilized from working capital in and increased earnings and non cash charges in these increases were partially offset by a higher level of employer contributions to pension and postretirement plans in tax payments in the periods presented were favorably impacted by federal legislation extending bonus depreciation and a change in the tax method for recognizing repair and maintenance activities 
federal legislation allowing bonus depreciation on qualifying capital expenditures was increased to percent for  percent for  and continues at percent for a significant portion of the company s capital expenditures qualify for this bonus treatment 
financing cash flow net cash flow required for financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ending december    and  respectively 
financing activity across all periods reflects the company s utilization of the long term capital markets in the current low interest rate environment 
since  the company has refinanced at lower rates approximately million of maturing or callable long term debt 
these lower rates began to favorably impact interest expense in the fourth quarter of  and more noticeably decreased interest expense in the company s operating cash flow funded approximately percent of capital expenditures and dividends in and over percent in and recently completed long term financing transactions are more fully described below

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates  and counter party credit 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company s risk management program includes  among other things  the use of derivatives 
the company executes derivative contracts in the normal course of operations while buying and selling commodities and occasionally when managing interest rate risk 
the company has in place a risk management committee that consists of senior management as well as financial and operational management 
the committee is actively involved in identifying risks as well as reviewing and authorizing risk mitigation strategies 
commodity price risk regulated operations the company s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas  coal and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current state regulations  which subject to compliance with those regulations  allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms 
constructive regulatory orders  such as those authorizing lost margin recovery  other innovative rate designs  and recovery of unaccounted for gas and other gas related expenses  also mitigate the effect volatile gas costs may have on the company s financial condition 
although vectren s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas and coal prices have other effects on working capital requirements  interest costs  and some level of price sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered 
the company recently began purchasing call options that are designed to cap gas costs on approximately percent of peak winter delivery periods 
such contracts are generally short term in nature and are insignificant in terms of value and volume at december  however  it is possible that the utilization of these instruments may grow in the future 
wholesale power marketing the company s wholesale power marketing activities undertake strategies to optimize electric generating capacity beyond that needed for native load 
in recent years  the primary strategy involves the sale of generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
the company accounts for any energy contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
no market sensitive derivative positions were outstanding on december  and for retail sales of electricity  the company receives the majority of its nox and so allowances at zero cost through an allocation process 
based on arrangements with regulators  wholesale operations can purchase allowances from retail operations at current market values  the value of which is distributed back to retail customers through a miso cost recovery tracking mechanism 
wholesale operations are therefore at risk for the cost of allowances  which for the recent past have been volatile 
the company manages this risk by purchasing allowances from retail operations as needed and occasionally from other third parties in advance of usage 
in the past  the company also used derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk  but no such derivative instruments were outstanding at december  or other operations other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with gasoline diesel  coal  and natural gas through proliance 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
the company  as well as proliance  purchase and sell natural gas and coal to meet customer demands 
forward contracts  and occasionally option contracts  commit them to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward sell positions is mitigated using stored inventory and  for proliance  offsetting forward purchase contracts 
related to coal mining operations  contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 
proliance more frequently uses financial instruments that are derivatives to hedge its market exposures that arise from gas in storage  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts 
occasionally  the company will hedge a portion of its gasoline requirements using financial instruments 
however  during the years presented such utilization has not been significant 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements 
its risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
the company limits this risk by allowing only an annual average of percent to percent of its total debt to be exposed to variable rate volatility 
however  this targeted range may not always be attained during the seasonal increases in short term borrowings 
to manage this exposure  the company may use derivative financial instruments 
market risk is estimated as the potential impact resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate borrowing arrangements exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
during and  the weighted average combined borrowings under these arrangements approximated million and million  respectively 
at december   combined borrowings under these arrangements were million 
as of december  combined borrowings under these arrangements were million  which excludes the impact of a million long term debt issuance occurring february based upon average borrowing rates under these facilities during the years ended december  and  an increase of basis points one percentage point in the rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million in and million in other risks by using financial instruments to manage risk  the company  as well as proliance  creates exposure to counter party credit risk and market risk 
the company manages exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into contracts with companies that can be reasonably expected to fully perform under the terms of the contract 
counter party credit risk is monitored regularly and positions are adjusted appropriately to manage risk 
further  tools such as netting arrangements and requests for collateral are also used to manage credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates 
the company attempts to manage exposure to market risk associated with commodity contracts and interest rates by establishing parameters and monitoring those parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
the company s customer receivables associated with utility operations are primarily derived from residential  commercial  and industrial customers located in indiana and west central ohio 
however  some exposure from nonutility operations extends throughout the united states 
the company manages credit risk associated with its receivables by continually reviewing creditworthiness and requests cash deposits or refunds cash deposits based on that review 
credit risk associated with certain investments is also managed by a review of creditworthiness and receipt of collateral 
in addition  credit risk is mitigated by regulatory orders that allow recovery of all uncollectible accounts expense in ohio and the gas cost portion of uncollectible accounts expense in indiana based on historical experience
