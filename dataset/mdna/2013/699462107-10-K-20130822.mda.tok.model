these services are often bundled together and integrated with other applications to provide an eclinical solution for our clients 
we conduct a significant portion of our operations in foreign countries 
approximately and of our consolidated service revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively  were from non us operations 
because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on our operating results 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was from euro denominated contracts and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was from pound sterling denominated contracts 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was from euro denominated contracts and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was from pounds sterling denominated contracts 
approximately of our contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flows from these contracts typically consist of a down payment required at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is recognized generally as work is performed 
as a result  the timing of client billing and cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  our clients can either terminate their contracts with us upon thirty to sixty days notice or delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or clinical drug manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the product 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved  or the susceptibility of such matter to change  and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition we derive revenue from the delivery of services or software solutions to clients in the worldwide pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and medical device industries 
we recognize revenue as services are performed when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service offering has been delivered to the client  the collection of fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
our client arrangements in crs generally involve multiple service deliverables  where bundled service deliverables are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  multiple element arrangements 
we determined that each of our service deliverables has standalone value and base the selling price upon third party evidence tpe 
tpe is established for each of our arrangement deliverables based on the price we charge for equivalent services when sold to other similar customers as well as our knowledge of market pricing from the competitive bidding process for customer contracts offering similar services to comparably situated customers 
within perceptive s clinphone rtsm business  we offer selected software solutions through a hosted application delivered through a standard web browser 
we recognize revenue from application hosting services in accordance with asc  revenue recognition in the software industry and asc as our customers do not have the right to take possession of the software 
revenue resulting from these hosting services is recognized over the service period 
critical management estimates may be involved in the determination of the customer relationship period  and other revenue elements 
changes to these elements could affect the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
billed and unbilled accounts receivable billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients based upon contract terms 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients due to contract terms 
we maintain a provision for losses on receivables based on historical collectability and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
critical management estimates may be involved in the determination of collectability and the amounts required to be recorded as provisions for losses on receivables 
income taxes our global provision for corporate income taxes is determined in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of asc  which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances 
in addition  asc requires financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in income tax reporting positions 
we are subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities that may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is based on judgment 
we believe we have adequately provided for any uncertain tax positions 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition and is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequent testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
our impairment testing for goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible  the clinphone rtsm tradename  involves assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of the indefinite lived intangibles is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
this assessment requires management judgment on the potential impact of each qualitative factor 
based on our fiscal year qualitative assessment of impairment for goodwill and our tradename  we concluded that neither were impaired 
business combinations business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting 
allocating the purchase price requires us to estimate the fair value of various assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent consideration to be paid if specific financial targets are achieved 
we are responsible for determining the appropriate valuation model and estimated fair values  and in doing so  we consider a number of factors  including information provided by an outside valuation advisor 
we primarily establish fair value using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model 
the income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses  as well as discount factors and income tax rates 
results of operations note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report provides a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended june  and analysis by segment we evaluate our segment performance and allocate resources based on service revenue and gross profit service revenue less direct costs  while other operating costs are allocated and evaluated on a geographic basis 
accordingly  we do not include the impact of selling  general  and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  interest income expense  other income loss  and income tax expense benefit in segment profitability 
we attribute revenue to individual countries based upon the cost of services performed in the respective countries and inter segment transactions are not included in service revenue

revenue growth in all regions was attributable to higher demand for services in all of our reporting segments and the impact of our strategic partnership wins 
the conversion of backlog to revenue increased as projects matured and moved from startup phases to ongoing monitoring activities

on a segment basis  crs direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from increased labor costs associated with headcount growth in crs to match the demand of higher levels of clinical trial activity 
increased labor costs were also affected by upward pressure on wage rates in certain markets due to labor shortages and an increase in the number of contracted staff needed for projects in response to the higher number of studies that were initiated in fiscal year and the beginning of fiscal year the use of contracted staff declined in the latter half of fiscal year as full time employees were hired to replace them  and as the crs employee base increased its productivity and efficiency

liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and growth with cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of equity securities  and credit facilities to fund business acquisitions and working capital

as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and marketable securities of million  of which the majority is held in foreign countries since excess cash generated in the us is primarily used to repay our debt obligations 
foreign cash and marketable securities balances include unremitted foreign earnings  which are invested indefinitely outside of the us our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are held in deposit accounts  money market funds and foreign government treasury certificates over days but less than one year  which provide us with immediate and unlimited access to the funds 
repatriation of funds to the us from non us entities may be subject to taxation or certain legal restrictions 
nevertheless  most of our cash resides in countries with few or no such restrictions 
days sales outstanding our operating cash flow is heavily influenced by changes in the levels of billed and unbilled receivables and deferred revenue 
these account balances as well as days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable  net of deferred revenue  can vary based on contractual milestones and the timing and size of cash receipts 
we calculate dso by adding end of period balances for billed and unbilled account receivables  net of deferred revenue short term and long term and the provision for losses on receivables  then dividing the resulting amount by the sum of total revenue plus investigator fees billed for the most recent quarter  and multiplying the resulting fraction by the number of days in the quarter

pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the overall net position is used as a basis by the bank for calculating the overall pool interest amount 
each legal entity owned by us and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit deposit or a debit overdraft balance 
therefore  interest income is earned by legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged to legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s aggregate balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference

financing needs our primary cash needs are for operating expenses such as salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting  business development and facilities  business acquisitions  stock buybacks  capital expenditures  and repayment of principal and interest on our borrowings 
in august  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program the program authorizing the repurchase of up to million of our common stock to be financed with cash on hand  cash generated from operations  existing credit facilities  or new financing 
while the program did not obligate us to acquire any particular dollar value or number of shares of common stock  we repurchased million of our common stock from the period september to june  with the remaining million of purchases occurring early in july this was achieved by entering into two separate million accelerated share repurchase asr agreements and two separate million open market agreements the open market agreements as described below 
the fiscal year buyback activity also resulted in a reduction of our stockholders equity of million for the value of shares repurchased and retired by the company 
in september  we entered into an asr agreement the september agreement to purchase shares of our common stock from jp morgan securities llc  as agent for jpmorgan chase bank  national association  london branch jpmorgan  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in march  we finalized the settlement of the september agreement and received an additional  shares representing the final shares delivered by jpmorgan 
these shares were in addition to the initial  shares of our common stock delivered to us in september the total number of shares repurchased under the september agreement was  at an average price per share of in march  we entered into a second million asr agreement the march agreement with jpmorgan 
pursuant to the march agreement  jpmorgan delivered  shares of our common stock  representing an estimated percent of the shares to be repurchased by us under the agreement based on a price of per share  which was the closing price of our common stock on march  in july  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we finalized the settlement of the march agreement and received an additional  shares representing the final shares delivered by jpmorgan

in december  we acquired liquent for million 
the purchase price was initially funded through a new million unsecured term loan agreement the term loan with bank of america  na the term loan was later repaid by the borrowing under the credit agreement 
in april  we acquired heron for million  plus potential cash payments of up to million over a twenty six month period if specific financial targets for heron are achieved 
the acquisition was funded with existing cash on hand 
in july  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due july  for aggregate gross proceeds of million in a private placement solely to accredited investors 
we utilized the proceeds from the private placement to pay down debt outstanding under our credit agreement 
the note purchase agreement permits the proceeds from the private placement to be used for working capital purposes  stock repurchase financing  debt refinancing  and for general corporate purposes including the financing of acquisitions 
our requirements for cash to pay principal and interest on our borrowings will increase significantly in future periods based on amounts borrowed under our credit agreement and the notes to refinance prior debt facilities and to provide working capital 
our primary committed external source of funds is the credit agreement  described above 
our principal source of cash is from the performance of services under contracts with our clients 
if we are unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients or if the level of contract cancellations increases  our revenue and cash flow would be adversely affected see part i  item a risk factors for further detail on these risks 
absent a material adverse change in the level of our new business bookings or contract cancellations  we believe that our existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs over the next twelve months and on a longer term basis 
depending upon our revenue and cash flow from operations  it is possible that we will require external funds to repay amounts outstanding under our credit agreement upon its maturity in we expect to continue to acquire businesses that enhance our service and product offerings  expand our therapeutic expertise  and or increase our global presence 
depending on their size  any future acquisitions may require additional external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
we may be unable to secure such financing at all or on terms acceptable to us  as a result of our outstanding borrowings  including our outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
under the terms of the credit agreement  interest rates are fixed based on market indices at the time of borrowing and  depending upon the interest mechanism selected by us  may float thereafter 
as a result  the amount of interest payable by us on our borrowings may increase if market interest rates change 
however  we expect to mitigate the risk of increasing market interest rates with our hedging programs described below under part ii

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we derived approximately of our consolidated service revenue for fiscal year from operations outside of the united states and of our consolidated service revenue for fiscal year from operations outside of the united states 
in addition  of our consolidated revenue was denominated in euros and was denominated in pounds sterling for fiscal year while of our consolidated revenue was denominated in euros and was denominated in pounds sterling for fiscal year we have no significant operations in any country in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
it is our policy to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
accordingly  we have instituted foreign currency hedging programs and an interest rate swap cap program 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information on our hedging programs and interest rate swap program 
as of june   the programs with derivatives designated as hedging instruments under asc and the related notional values of the derivatives were approximately million  including interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements with a total notional value of million executed to hedge our borrowings under our credit agreement 
under certain circumstances  such as the occurrence of significant differences between actual cash receipts and forecasted cash receipts  the asc programs could be deemed ineffective 
in that event  the unrealized gains and losses related to these derivatives  which are currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  would be recognized in earnings 
as of june   the estimated amount that could be recognized in earnings was a loss of approximately million  net of tax 
as of june   the notional value of derivatives that were not designated as hedging instruments under asc was approximately million 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of million and million  respectively 
we also have exposure to additional foreign exchange rate risk as it relates to assets and liabilities that are not part of the economic hedge or designated hedging programs  but quantification of this risk is difficult to assess at any given point in time 
our exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to the amount of our short term and long term debt 
short term debt was million at june  and million at june  long term debt was million at june  and million at june  based on average short term and long term debt for fiscal year  an increase in the average interest rate of basis points would decrease our pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis 
in april and may  we entered into three treasury lock agreements  each with a notional amount of million  in connection with the planned issuance of our notes that were issued in july the three treasury locks were used to minimize our interest rate exposure prior to locking in the fixed interest rate on our notes 
the treasury locks matured in may when the interest rates on our notes were fixed 
the treasury locks were deemed to be fully effective in accordance with asc  and as such  the unrealized gains related to these derivatives are recorded as other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the life of the notes
