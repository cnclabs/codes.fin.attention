item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  those described above under item a 
risk factors  and forward looking statements safe harbor below 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
we are a leading provider of government outsourced services specializing in the management of correctional  detention and re entry facilities  and the provision of community based services and youth services in the united states  australia  south africa  the united kingdom and canada 
we own  lease and operate a broad range of correctional and detention facilities including maximum  medium and minimum security prisons  immigration detention centers  minimum security detention centers and community based re entry facilities 
we offer counseling  education and or treatment to inmates with alcohol and drug abuse problems at most of the domestic facilities we manage 
as of december   our worldwide operations included the ownership  leasing and management of approximately  beds at correctional  detention and residential facilities  including idle facilities and projects under development  and also included the provision of monitoring services  tracking approximately  offenders on behalf of approximately federal  state and local correctional agencies located in all states 
our correctional and detention management services involve the provision of security  administrative  rehabilitation  education  and food services  primarily at adult male correctional and detention facilities 
our community based 
table of contents services  operated through our geo community services business segment  involve supervision of adult parolees and probationers and the provision of temporary housing  programming  employment assistance and other services with the intention of the successful reintegration of residents into the community 
our youth services division  operated through the geo community services business segment  include residential  detention and shelter care and community based services along with rehabilitative  and educational programs 
our monitoring services  operated through the geo community services business segment  provide our governmental clients with innovative compliance technologies  industry leading monitoring services  and evidence based supervision and treatment programs for community based parolees  probationers and pretrial defendants  including services to ice for the provision of services designed to improve the participation of non detained aliens in the immigration court system 
we develop new facilities  using our project development experience to design  construct and finance what we believe are state of the art facilities that maximize security and efficiency 
we also provide secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations as contracted domestically  and in the united kingdom  our joint venture geoamey is responsible for providing prisoner escort and custody services in the united kingdom  including all of wales and all of england except london and east of england 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january   we had consolidated revenues of billion and billion  respectively  and we maintained an average company wide facility occupancy rate of including  active beds and excluding  idle beds marketed to potential customers for the year ended december   and including  active beds and excluding  idle beds marketed to potential customers for the year ended january  reit conversion and divestiture of rts in the first half of we engaged legal and financial advisors to assist our board of directors the board with the comprehensive review of a potential reit conversion 
in july  we submitted a request to the united states internal revenue service the irs for a private letter ruling plr to determine whether we would qualify to convert into a reit 
in december  we announced that the board  following a thorough and careful consideration of ways to maximize shareholder value through alternative financing  capital and other strategies  unanimously authorized us to take all necessary steps  including the divestiture of certain health care assets to position ourselves to operate in compliance with the reit rules beginning january  on january   we received a favorable private letter ruling from the irs with respect to certain issues relevant to our qualification as a reit 
during the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our operations and moved non real estate components into taxable reit subsidiaries trs s 
through the trs structure  a portion of our businesses  which are non real estate related  such as our managed only contracts  international operations  electronic monitoring services  and other non residential facilities  are part of wholly owned taxable subsidiaries of the reit 
most of our business segments  which are real estate related and involve company owned and company leased facilities  are part of the reit 
the trs structure allows us to maintain the strategic alignment of almost all of our diversified business segments under one entity 
the trs assets and operations will continue to be subject  as applicable  to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 
applicable reit rules substantially restrict the ability of reits to own health care facilities 
as a result  in order to achieve and preserve reit status  on december   the company completed the divestiture of all of its residential health care facility assets and related management contracts residential treatment services or rts 
under our wholly owned subsidiaries  geo care llc and geo group australia pty 
ltd  we held managed only health care facility contracts  totaling  beds  and provided correctional mental health services for the palm beach county  florida jail system as well as correctional health care services in publicly operated prisons in the state of victoria  australia 
the operating results of rts and the loss on disposal have been classified in discontinued operations 
refer to note discontinued operations of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
a reit is not permitted to retain earnings and profits accumulated during the years it was taxed as a c corporation and must make one or more distributions to shareholders that equal or exceed these accumulated amounts 
on december   we announced the declaration by our board of a special dividend of accumulated earnings and profits on our shares of common stock  par value  payable in either common stock or cash to  and at the election of  the shareholders of record as of december  the special dividend  amounted to an aggregate of million  or per share of common stock  and was paid on december  to shareholders of record as of december  pursuant to the special dividend terms  we issued  shares of common stock and paid cash of million 
as a reit  we will be required to distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gain 
we intend to commence paying regular distributions in on january   the board declared our first quarterly reit cash dividend of per share of common stock  which will be paid on march  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  the amount  timing and frequency of future distributions  however  will be at the sole discretion of our board and will be declared based upon various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  our financial condition and operating cash flows  the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay  limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments  limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trs and other factors that our board may deem relevant 

table of contents change of segment name from geo care to geo community services our geo care reporting segment previously consisted of four aggregated operating segments including residential treatment services  community based services  youth services and bi 
the geo care reporting segment was renamed geo community services concurrent with the divestiture of our residential treatment services operating segment as more fully disclosed below 
all current and prior year financial position and results of operations amounts presented for this segment are referred to as geo community services 
refer to note discontinued operations of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information 
the financial position and results of operations of the residential treatment services operating segment are classified as discontinued operations for the current and prior years presented 
critical accounting policies we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition facility management revenues are recognized as services are provided under facility management contracts with approved government appropriations based on a net rate per day per inmate or on a fixed monthly rate  as applicable 
a limited number of our contracts have provisions upon which a small portion of the revenue for the contract is based on the performance of certain targets 
revenue based on the performance of certain targets is less than of our consolidated annual revenues 
these performance targets are based on specific criteria to be met over specific periods of time 
such criteria includes our ability to achieve certain contractual benchmarks relative to the quality of service we provide  non occurrence of certain disruptive events  effectiveness of our quality control programs and our responsiveness to customer requirements and concerns 
for the limited number of contracts where revenue is based on the performance of certain targets  revenue is either i recorded pro rata when revenue is fixed and determinable or ii recorded when the specified time period lapses 
in many instances  we are a party to more than one contract with a single entity 
in these instances  each contract is accounted for separately 
we have not recorded any revenue that is at risk due to future performance contingencies 
construction revenues are recognized from our contracts with certain customers to perform construction and design services project development services for various facilities 
in these instances  we act as the primary developer and subcontract with bonded national and or regional design build contractors 
these construction revenues are recognized as earned on a percentage of completion basis measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total cost for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes to cost estimates are made in the period in which we determine that such losses and changes are probable 
typically  we enter into fixed price contracts and do not perform additional work unless approved change orders are in place 
costs attributable to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred if we believe that it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
if we believe that it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price  costs related to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which they are incurred  and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the costs incurred 
revenue in excess of the costs attributable to unapproved change orders is not recognized until the change order is approved 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to 
table of contents estimated costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
for the fiscal years ended december   january   and january   there have been no changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability that would require a revision to the estimated costs and income related to project development services 
as the primary contractor  we are exposed to the various risks associated with construction  including the risk of cost overruns 
accordingly  we record our construction revenue on a gross basis and include the related cost of construction activities in operating expenses 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements for certain contracts where we provide project development services to our clients in addition to standard management services  we follow revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements 
this revenue recognition guidance related to multiple deliverables in an arrangement provides guidance on determining if separate contracts should be evaluated as a single arrangement and if an arrangement involves a single unit of accounting or separate units of accounting and if the arrangement is determined to have separate units  how to allocate amounts received in the arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
in instances where we provide these project development services and subsequent management services  generally  the arrangement results in no delivered elements at the onset of the agreement 
the elements are delivered over the contract period as the project development and management services are performed 
project development services are not provided separately to a customer without a management contract 
during the fiscal year ended january  we implemented asu no 
which provides amendments to revenue recognition criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements 
the implementation of this standard in the fiscal year ended january  did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the amendments  among other things  establish the selling price of a deliverable  replace the term fair value with selling price and eliminate the residual method such that consideration can be allocated to the deliverables using the relative selling price method based on our specific assumptions 
as a result of the bi acquisition  we also periodically sell our monitoring equipment and other services together in multiple element arrangements 
in such cases  we allocate revenue on the basis of the relative selling price of the delivered and undelivered elements 
the selling price for each of the elements is estimated based on the price we charge when the elements are sold on a stand alone basis 
reserves for insurance losses the nature of our business exposes us to various types of third party legal claims  including  but not limited to  civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and or mistreatment  sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees  product liability claims  intellectual property infringement claims  claims relating to employment matters including  but not limited to  employment discrimination claims  union grievances and wage and hour claims  property loss claims  environmental claims  automobile liability claims  contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities  programs  electronic monitoring products  personnel or prisoners  including damages arising from a prisoner s escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility 
in addition  our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation 
we maintain a broad program of insurance coverage for these general types of claims  except for claims relating to employment matters  for which we carry no insurance 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed 
it is our general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into our corporate master policies in order to take advantage of certain economies of scale 
we currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability policies with total limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate covering the operations of us corrections detention  geo community services community based services  geo community services youth services and bi 
we have a claims made liability insurance program with a specific loss limit of million per occurrence and in the aggregate related to medical professional liability claims arising out of correctional healthcare services 
we are uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits 
we also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including  workers compensation  environmental liability and automobile liability 
for most casualty insurance policies  we carry substantial deductibles or self insured retentions of million per occurrence for general liability and medical professional liability  million per occurrence for workers compensation and million per occurrence for automobile liability 
in addition  certain of our facilities located in florida and other high risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles 
since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events  no reserves have been established to pre fund for potential windstorm damage 
limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in california and the pacific northwest may prevent the company from insuring some of its facilities to full replacement value 
with respect to operations in south africa  the united kingdom and australia  we utilize a combination of locally procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and protect us 
in addition to these policies  our australian subsidiary carries tail insurance on a general liability policy related to a discontinued contract 

table of contents of the reserves discussed above  our most significant insurance reserves relate to workers compensation  general liability and auto claims 
these reserves are undiscounted and were million and million as of december  and january   respectively and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
we use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported 
in applying these methods and assessing their results  we consider such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of our facilities  claim development  payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business  among other factors 
such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments 
our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards 
we also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the estimation process  including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim 
because we have high deductible insurance policies  the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience 
if actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 
income taxes the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal  state  local and foreign income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date 
at december   we have reversed certain deferred tax assets and liabilities related to its reit activities refer to note income taxes in part ii  item of this form k 
effective january   as a reit that plans to distribute of its taxable income to shareholders  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes at the reit level including its qualified reit subsidiaries  but instead a dividends paid deduction will generally offset our taxable income 
since we do not expect to pay taxes on our reit taxable income we do not expect to be able to recognize such net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
significant judgments are required to determine the consolidated provision for income taxes 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
realization of the our deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors such as tax regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income and the character of such taxable income 
additionally  we must use significant judgment in addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
if actual circumstances differ from the our assumptions  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets or liabilities may be required  which may result in an adverse impact on the results of our operations and our effective tax rate 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria 
we have not made any significant changes to the way we accounts for its deferred tax assets and liabilities in any year presented in the consolidated financial statements  with the exception of the reversal of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our reit conversion 
based on our estimate of future earnings and our favorable earnings history  we currently expect full realization of the deferred tax assets net of any recorded valuation allowances 
furthermore  tax positions taken by us may not be fully sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
in determining the adequacy of our provision benefit for income taxes  potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations are regularly assessed 
as such  the final outcome of tax examinations  including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues  cannot be estimated with certainty 
to the extent that the provision for income taxes increases decreases by of income before income taxes  equity in earnings of affiliate  discontinued operations and consolidated income from continuing operations would have decreased increased by million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended december   january  and january  property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over to years 
accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used for income tax purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset 
if the assessment indicates that assets will be used for a longer or shorter period than previously anticipated  the useful lives of the assets are revised  resulting in a change in estimate 
we have not made any changes in estimates during the fiscal years ended december  or january  maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of correctional and detention facilities 
capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life 

table of contents assets held for sale as of december   we had classified four facilities as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet 
we classify a long lived asset disposal group as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met i management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset disposal group  ii the asset disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to the terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets disposal groups  iii an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset disposal group have been initiated  iv the sale of the asset disposal group is probable  and transfer of the asset disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  within one year  except as permitted  v the asset disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and vi actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
we record assets held for sale at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and estimate fair value by using third party appraisers or other valuation techniques 
we do not record depreciation for assets held for sale 
any gain or loss on the sale of operating assets is included in the operating income of the reportable segment to which it relates 
asset impairments we had property and equipment of billion as of december  and january  including approximately  vacant beds at seven idle facilities with a carrying value of million which are being marketed to potential customers as of december   excluding equipment and other assets that can be easily transferred for use at other facilities 
we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment assessment include deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  or when other changes occur that might impair recovery of long lived assets such as the termination of a management contract or a significant decrease in inmate population 
if impairment indicators are present  we perform a recoverability test to determine whether or not an impairment loss should be measured 
we test idle facilities for impairment upon notification that the facilities will no longer be utilized by the customer 
if a long lived asset is part of a group that includes other assets  the unit of accounting for the long lived asset is its group 
generally  we group assets by facility for the purpose of considering whether any impairment exists 
the estimates of recoverability are based on projected undiscounted cash flows associated with actual marketing efforts where available or  in other instances  projected undiscounted cash flows that are comparable to historical cash flows from management contracts at similar facilities and sensitivity analyses that consider reductions to such cash flows 
our sensitivity analyses include adjustments to projected cash flows compared to the historical cash flows due to current business conditions which impact per diem rates as well as labor and other operating costs  changes related to facility mission due to changes in prospective clients  and changes in projected capacity and occupancy rates 
we also factor in prolonged periods of vacancies as well as the time and costs required to ramp up facility population once a contract is obtained 
we perform the impairment analyses on an annual basis for each of the idle facilities and update each quarter for market developments for the potential utilization of each of the facilities in order to identify events that may cause us to reconsider the most recent assumptions 
such events could include negotiations with a prospective customer for the utilization of an idle facility at terms significantly less favorable than used in our most recent impairment analysis  or changes in legislation surrounding a particular facility that could impact our ability to house certain types of inmates at such facility 
further  a substantial increase in the number of available beds at other facilities that we own  or in the marketplace  could lead to deterioration in market conditions and projected cash flows 
although they are not frequently received  an unsolicited offer to purchase any of our idle facilities  at amounts that are less than their carrying value could also cause us to reconsider the assumptions used in the most recent impairment analysis 
we have identified marketing prospects to utilize each of the remaining currently idled facilities and do not see any catalysts that would result in a current impairment 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure management contracts to utilize our idle facilities  or that we will not incur impairment charges in the future 
in all cases  the projected undiscounted cash flows in our analysis as of december  substantially exceeded the carrying amounts of each facility 
our evaluations also take into consideration historical experience in securing new management contracts to utilize facilities that had been previously idled for periods comparable to or in excess of the periods our currently idle facilities have been idle 
such previously idle facilities are currently being operated under contracts that generate cash flows resulting in the recoverability of the net book value of the previously idled facilities by substantial amounts 
due to a variety of factors  the lead time to negotiate contracts with federal and state agencies to utilize idle bed capacity is generally lengthy which has historically resulted in periods of idleness similar to the ones we are currently experiencing 
as a result of its analyses  we determined each of these assets to have recoverable values substantially in excess of the corresponding carrying values with the exception of one of our idle facilities in brush  colorado which was written down by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this facility was written down to its land value as we had exhausted all avenues to market the facility 

table of contents by their nature  these estimates contain uncertainties with respect to the extent and timing of the respective cash flows due to potential delays or material changes to forecasted terms and conditions in contracts with prospective customers that could impact the estimate of projected cash flows 
notwithstanding the effects the current economy has had on our customers demand for prison beds in the short term which has led to our decision to idle certain facilities  we believe the long term trends favor an increase in the utilization of our idle correctional facilities 
this belief is also based on our experience in operating in recessionary environments and based on our experience in working with governmental agencies faced with significant budgetary challenges which is a primary contributing factor to the lack of appropriated funding to build new bed capacity by federal and state agencies 
discontinued operations we report the results of operations of a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale or where the management contracts with that component have terminated either by expiration or otherwise in discontinued operations 
we present such events as discontinued operations so long as the financial results can be clearly identified  the future operations and cash flows are completely eliminated from ongoing operations  and so long as we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal or termination transaction 
when a component of an entity has been disposed of or classified as held for sale or a management contract is terminated  we look at our overall relationship with the customer 
if the operations or cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the transaction and the entity will not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the transaction  the results of operations of the component of an entity are reported in discontinued operations 
if we will continue to maintain a relationship generating significant cash flows and having continuing involvement with the customer  the disposal  the asset held for sale classification or the loss of the management contract s is not treated as discontinued operations 
if the disposal  the asset held for sale classification or the loss of the management contract s results in a loss in the overall customer relationship as no future significant cash flows will be generated and we will have no continuing involvement with the customer  the results are classified in discontinued operations 
recent accounting pronouncements the following accounting standards have an implementation date subsequent to the fiscal year ended december  and as such  have not yet been adopted by us during the fiscal year ended december  in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  intangibles  goodwill and other  which is intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
under the revised guidance  an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of facts and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the carrying amount in accordance with subtopic under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendment is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  with early adoption permitted 
the implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this guidance requires an organization to present the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  but only if the item reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a

we also experienced aggregate increases in revenues of million at certain of our facilities primarily due to net increases in population  transportation services and or rates  including the expansion of new castle in the first quarter of these increases were partially offset by an aggregate decrease of million due to contract terminations and other decreases primarily related to lower populations at some facilities 
the number of compensated mandays in us corrections detention facilities was million in as compared to million in we experienced an aggregate net increase of approximately  mandays as a result of our new contracts discussed above and also as a result of population increases at certain facilities 
these increases were partially offset by decreases resulting from contract terminations 
we look at the average occupancy in our facilities to determine how we are managing our available beds 
the average occupancy is calculated by taking compensated mandays as a percentage of capacity 
the average occupancy in our us detention corrections facilities was and of capacity in and  respectively  excluding idle facilities 
geo community services the increase in revenues for geo community services in as compared to is primarily attributable to a full year of revenues generated by bi in compared to approximately ten and a half months of revenues in which contributed to an increase of million 
we also experienced a net increase in revenues of million at certain of our facilities primarily due to increases in population and or rates 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues of million related to our terminated contracts 
international services revenues for our international services segment during increased by million over primarily due to the following factors i aggregate increases at our australian subsidiary of million related to population increases  contractual increases linked to the inflationary index and the provision of additional services under certain contracts  ii aggregate increases at our south african subsidiary of million primarily due to increases in the inflationary index  and iii an increase of million due to the provision of additional services at harmondsworth and the assumption of operations at dungavel on september  these increases were partially offset by decreases of million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and a decrease of million in revenues due to the termination of the management contracts for the operation of campsfield house immigration removal centre campsfield house

we also donated one of our facilities during the fourth quarter which resulted in an increase of million 
these increases were partially offset by aggregate decreases in operating expenses of million due to contract terminations 
in addition  operating expenses decreased by million in due to net operating tax refunds received  not related to income taxes  for certain previously disputed tax claims in various jurisdictions 
geo community services operating expenses for geo community services increased million during from primarily due to bi  which was operating for a full year during compared to a partial year during as bi was acquired in february these increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses for terminated contracts 
during  we experienced a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue due to improved margins resulting from our acquisition of bi 
international services operating expenses for our international services segment during increased million over the prior year due to i an increase in operating expenses at our australian and south african subsidiaries of million related to increases in population and additional services provided at certain of those facilities  and ii a net increase of million in operating expenses in the united kingdom primarily due to the opening of dungavel on september   partially offset by the termination of our contract for the management of campsfield house effective in may  and an increase in international bid costs incurred during these net increases were partially offset by a decrease of million as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations

we have determined the swap  which has a notional amount of million  payment and expiration dates  and call provisions that coincide with the terms of the non recourse debt  to be an effective cash flow hedge

table of contents amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of fixed assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of cornell 
these positive impacts were offset by changes in our working capital components which were primarily driven by increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets

in addition  we paid million for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program and million for shares of common stock which were purchased from certain directors and executives and retired immediately after purchase 
inflation we believe that inflation  in general  did not have a material effect on our results of operations during  and while some of our contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  inflation could have a substantial adverse effect on our results of operations in the future to the extent that wages and salaries  which represent our largest expense  increase at a faster rate than the per diem or fixed rates received by us for our management services 
outlook the following discussion of our future performance contains statements that are not historical statements and  therefore  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statement 
please refer to item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k  the forward looking statements safe harbor  as well as the other disclosures contained in this annual report on form k  for further discussion on forward looking statements and the risks and other factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals and cause the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward looking statements 
revenue domestically  we continue to pursue a number of opportunities in the privatized corrections and detention industry 
overcrowding at corrections facilities in various states and increased demand for bed space at federal prisons and detention facilities are two of the factors that have contributed to the opportunities for privatization 
in new hampshire  we have responded to a state procurement for a new correctional facility totaling approximately  beds 
at the federal level  we are responding to a procurement issued by the federal bureau of prisons totaling up to  beds 
in florida  the department of management services has issued a request for proposal for the rebid of  private prison beds which are currently managed by a different private operator 
in michigan  the legislature has authorized legislative language for the privatization of  in state beds 
we continue to be encouraged by opportunities as discussed above  however any positive trends may  to some 
table of contents extent  be adversely impacted by government budgetary constraints in the future 
while state fiscal conditions continue to improve at a slow to moderate rate of recovery with revenue performance remaining solid for most states through the first quarter of fiscal year  a handful of states remain concerned about their ability to meet the revenue forecast in fiscal year according to a recent survey conducted in the fall of by the national conference of state legislatures 
as a result of budgetary pressures  state correctional agencies may pursue a number of cost savings initiatives which may include the early release of inmates  changes to parole laws and sentencing guidelines  and reductions in per diem rates and or the scope of services provided by private operators 
these potential cost savings initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our current operations and or our ability to pursue new business opportunities 
effective october   the state of california began implementing its criminal justice realignment plan  which has delegated tens of thousands of low level state offenders to local county jurisdictions in california 
as a result of this decision  the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cancelled our agreements for the housing of low level state offenders at three of our california community correctional facilities 
in january  we also received notice from the cdcr of its intention to terminate the contract at golden state modified community correctional facility however  this termination was rescinded in april and most recently in october  the state of california extended the contract for the golden state modified community correctional facility through june  we plan to market the idle facilities to federal  state and local jurisdictions in california 
additionally  if state budgetary constraints  as discussed above  persist or intensify  our state customers ability to pay us may be impaired and or we may be forced to renegotiate our management contracts on less favorable terms and our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 
we plan to actively bid on any new projects that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
although we are pleased with the overall industry outlook  positive trends in the industry may be offset by several factors  including budgetary constraints  unanticipated contract terminations  contract non renewals  and or contract re bids 
although we have historically had a relatively high contract renewal rate  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our expiring management contracts on favorable terms  or at all 
also  while we are pleased with our track record in re bid situations  we cannot assure that we will prevail in any such future situations 
internationally  we are exploring a number opportunities in our current markets and will continue to actively bid on any opportunities that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
with respect to our youth services  electronic monitoring services  and re entry services business conducted through our geo community business segment  we are currently pursuing a number of business development opportunities 
in connection with our merger with cornell in august and our acquisition of bi in february  we have significantly expanded the service offerings of geo community by adding electronic monitoring services  community re entry and immigration related supervision services 
relative to opportunities for community based re entry centers  we expect to compete for several formal solicitations from the bureau of prisons the bop for re entry centers across the country and are also working with our existing local and state correctional clients to leverage new opportunities for both residential facilities as well as non residential day reporting centers 
we continue to expend resources on informing state and local governments about the benefits of privatization and we anticipate that there will be new opportunities in the future as those efforts begin to yield results 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any suitable opportunities that become available in this area 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our contracts to provide services to our governmental clients 
labor and related cost represented of our operating expenses in additional significant operating expenses include food  utilities and inmate medical costs 
in  operating expenses totaled of our consolidated revenues 
our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in will be impacted by the opening of any new or existing facilities as a result of the cost of transitioning and or start up operations related to a facility opening 
during  we will incur carrying costs for facilities that are currently vacant in the carrying costs associated with the approximately  beds we are currently marketing are expected to be million  including depreciation of million 
we will also experience increases as a result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of bi 
as of december   our worldwide operations include the management and or ownership of approximately  beds at correctional  detention and residential treatment  youth services and community based facilities including idle facilities  and also include the provision of monitoring of approximately  offenders in a community based environment on behalf of approximately federal  state and local correctional agencies located in all states 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses 
in  general and administrative expenses totaled of our consolidated revenues 
we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in to decrease as a result of cost savings initiatives 
table of contents and decreases in nonrecurring costs related to our reit conversion 
we expect business development costs to remain consistent as we pursue additional business development opportunities in all of our business lines and build the corporate infrastructure necessary to support our mental health residential treatment services business 
we also plan to continue expending resources from time to time on the evaluation of potential acquisition targets 
idle facilities we are currently marketing approximately  vacant beds at seven of our idle facilities to potential customers 
the annual carrying cost of idle facilities in is estimated to be million  including depreciation expense of million 
as of december   these facilities had a net book value of million 
we currently do not have any firm commitment or agreement in place to activate these facilities 
historically  some facilities have been idle for multiple years before they received a new contract award 
currently  our north lake correctional facility located in baldwin  mi and our great plains correctional facility located in hinton  ok have been idle the longest of our idle facility inventory 
both facilities have been idle since october of these idle facilities are included in the us corrections detention segment 
the per diem rates that we charge our clients often vary by contract across our portfolio 
however  if all of these idle facilities were to be activated using our us corrections detention average per diem rate in  calculated as the us corrections detention revenue divided by the number of us corrections detention mandays and based on the average occupancy rate in our us corrections detention facilities for  we would expect to receive incremental revenue of approximately million and an increase in earnings per share of approximately 
to 
per share based on our average us corrections and detention operating margin

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates with respect to our senior credit facility 
payments under the senior credit facility are indexed to a variable interest rate 
based on borrowings outstanding as of december  under the senior credit facility of million net of discount of million  for every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility  our total annual interest expense would increase by million 
as of december   we had four interest rate swap agreements in the aggregate notional amount of million 
these interest rate swaps  which have payment  expiration dates and call provisions that mirror the terms of the senior notes  effectively convert million of the senior notes into variable rate obligations 
under these interest rate swaps  we receive a fixed interest rate payment from the financial counterparties to the agreements equal to per year calculated on the notional million amount  while we make a variable interest rate payment to the same counterparties equal to the three month libor plus a fixed margin of between and  also calculated on the notional million amount 
for every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to our aggregate notional million of swap agreements relative to the senior notes  our annual interest expense would increase by million 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap arrangements for hedging purposes  fixing the interest rate on our australian non recourse debt to 
the difference between the floating rate and the swap rate on these instruments is recognized in interest expense within the respective entity 
because the interest rates with respect to these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical basis point change in the current interest rate would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents additionally  we invest our cash in a variety of short term financial instruments to provide a return 
these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less 
while these instruments are subject to interest rate risk  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the south african rand and the british pound currency exchange rates 
based upon our foreign currency exchange rate exposure as of december  with respect to our international operations  every percent change in historical currency rates would have a million effect on our financial position and a million impact on our results of operations over the next fiscal year
