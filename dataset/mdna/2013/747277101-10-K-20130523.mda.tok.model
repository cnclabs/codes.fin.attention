overview we design and supply high performance network infrastructure products that provide  enhance and manage computer data communication 
these products facilitate the rapid transfer of data and enable efficient resource sharing between servers  networks and storage 
our products are used in enterprise data centers  cloud computing  web and other environments dependent on high performance  reliable data networking 
our products are based primarily on fibre channel and ethernet technologies and are used in connection with storage networks  local area networks  and converged networks 
storage networks are used to provide data across enterprise environments 
fibre channel is currently the dominant technology for enterprise storage networking 
local area networks  or lans  are used to provide workstation to server  server to server  and server to storage connectivity using ethernet 
converged networks are designed to address the evolving data center by consolidating and unifying various classes of connectivity and networks  such as storage area networks and lans  using ethernet speeds of gb per second and greater 
fibre channel over ethernet  or fcoe  is a converged networking technology that uses an ethernet lan for both storage and local area data transmission  thus combining the benefits of fibre channel technology with the pervasiveness of ethernet based networks 
similarly  internet small computer system interface  or iscsi  is an alternative to fcoe  also providing storage over ethernet capabilities 
our converged products can operate individually as gb ethernet network products  fcoe products  iscsi products  or in combination as multi protocol products 
we classify our products into three broad categories host products  network products and silicon products 
host products consist primarily of fibre channel adapters  fcoe converged network adapters  gb ethernet adapters  and fabriccache adapters 
network products consist of blade  edge and high port count modular chassis fibre channel switches  fibre channel virtualized pass through modules  universal access point switches  enhanced ethernet pass through modules and storage routers 
silicon products consist of application specific integrated circuits  or asics  comprised primarily of fibre channel controllers  converged network controllers  ethernet controllers  converged switch controllers  and converged lan on motherboard  or clom  controllers 
our products are sold worldwide  primarily to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and distributors 
our customers rely on our various networking infrastructure products to deliver solutions to information technology professionals in virtually every business sector 
our products are found primarily in 
table of contents server and storage subsystem solutions that are used by enterprises with critical business data requirements 
these products are incorporated in solutions from a number of server and storage system oem customers  including cisco systems  inc  dell inc  emc corporation  fujitsu ltd  hewlett packard company  huawei technologies co  ltd  inspur worldwide services ltd  international business machines corporation  lenovo group ltd  netapp  inc and oracle corporation 
we use a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest march fiscal years and each comprised fifty two weeks and ended on march  and april   respectively 
fiscal year comprised fifty three weeks and ended on april  the additional week in fiscal year did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
disposition of business in february  we completed the sale of the product lines and certain assets associated with our infiniband business the ib business 
as a result of this divestiture  our consolidated statements of income for all periods present the operations of the ib business as discontinued operations 
the following discussion and analysis is based on our continuing operations and excludes any results or discussion of our discontinued operations 
fiscal year and fourth quarter financial highlights and other information net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operations and used million of cash to purchase common stock under our stock repurchase program 
a summary of our financial performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal is as follows net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were million compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from host products were million compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from network products increased to million from million in the same quarter of fiscal revenues from silicon products were million compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal was compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal was compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal included an income tax benefit of million 
this tax benefit was the result of adjustments to certain tax positions subject to an internal revenue service irs examination and the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research tax credit 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million as of march  compared to million as of april  accounts receivable decreased to million as of march  from million as of april  days sales outstanding in receivables was days as of march  inventories were million as of march  compared to million as of april  our annualized inventory turns were in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents results of operations net revenues a summary of our net revenues by product category is as follows dollars in millions net revenues host products network products silicon products percentage of net revenues host products network products silicon products historically  the global marketplace for network infrastructure solutions has expanded in response to the information requirements of enterprise data centers  cloud computing  web and other environments dependent on high performance  reliable data networking 
the markets we serve have been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
the united states and other countries around the world have experienced  and may continue to experience  economic weakness and uncertainty 
economic uncertainty has adversely affected  and in the future may adversely affect  information technology spending rates  which has negatively impacted our revenue and operating results 
accordingly  it is extremely difficult for us to forecast future sales levels and historical information may not be indicative of future trends 
our net revenues are derived from the sale of host products  network products and silicon products 
net revenues of million for fiscal decreased from million in fiscal the decrease in net revenues was primarily the result of a million  or  decrease in revenue from host products and a million  or  decrease in revenue from silicon products 
the decrease in revenue from host products was primarily due to a decrease in the quantity of adapters sold 
the decrease in revenue from silicon products was primarily due to a decrease in the quantity of chips sold 
net revenues of million for fiscal were consistent with fiscal revenue from host products increased million  or  and revenue from silicon products increased million  or 
revenue from network products decreased million  or 
the increase in revenue from host products was primarily due to a increase in the average selling price of the adapters sold due to a favorable change in product mix  partially offset by a decrease in the quantity sold 
the increase in revenue from silicon products was due to a increase in the average selling price of the chips sold due to a favorable change in product mix  partially offset by a decrease in the quantity sold 
the decrease in revenue from network products was primarily due to a decrease in the quantity of switches sold 
a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our top ten customers accounted for  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents a summary of our customers  including their manufacturing subcontractors  that represent or more of our net revenues is as follows hewlett packard ibm dell we believe our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternative or additional sources 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
net revenues by geographic area are as follows in millions united states asia pacific and japan europe  middle east and africa rest of world revenues by geographic area are presented based upon the ship to location of the customer  which is not necessarily indicative of the location of the ultimate end user of our products 
the united states and china are the only countries that represented or more of net revenues for the years presented 
net revenues from customers in china were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of purchased products  assembly and test services  costs associated with product procurement  inventory management  logistics and product quality  and the amortization of purchased intangible assets 
a summary of our gross profit and related percentage of net revenues is as follows dollars in millions gross profit percentage of net revenues gross profit for fiscal decreased million  or  from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to an unfavorable product mix 
gross profit for fiscal decreased million from gross profit for fiscal and was consistent as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year 
our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage may be significantly affected by factors such as manufacturing volumes over which fixed costs are absorbed  sales discounts and customer incentives  component costs  the mix of products shipped  the transition to new products  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products  our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions  and amortization and 
table of contents impairments of purchased intangible assets 
we anticipate that it will continue to be difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
as a result of these and other factors  our gross profit percentage may decline in future periods 
operating expenses our operating expenses are summarized in the following table dollars in millions operating expenses engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative special charges percentage of net revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative special charges engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related employee benefit costs  outside service and material costs  occupancy and equipment costs and related computer support costs 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in cash compensation and related employee benefit costs  principally due to an increase in headcount  a million increase in outside service and material costs related to new product development  and a million increase in equipment depreciation and maintenance costs 
engineering and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in cash compensation and related employee benefit costs  primarily due to an increase in headcount  and a million increase in equipment depreciation and maintenance costs 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving future design wins  expansion of our customer base and revenue growth opportunities 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related employee benefit costs  sales commissions  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash compensation and related employee benefit costs  principally due to an increase in headcount 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash compensation and related employee benefit costs  principally due to an increase in headcount 
we believe continued investments in our sales and marketing organizational infrastructure and related marketing programs are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing relationships with our existing customers 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related employee benefit costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology personnel 
non compensation components of general and administrative expenses include accounting  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to a million decrease in cash compensation and related employee benefit costs and a million decrease in stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in cash compensation and related employee benefit costs 
income taxes our income tax expense benefit from continuing operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective income tax expense benefit rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our income tax benefit for fiscal was primarily the result of adjustments to certain tax positions subject to an irs examination 
these adjustments primarily consist of the settlement of a significant matter in the irs examination of our income tax returns for fiscal years and for an amount less than we had previously accrued related to this tax position 
in april  we settled all remaining matters relating to this irs examination without material adjustment 
we are no longer subject to federal income tax examinations for years prior to fiscal as of march   we have a deferred tax asset  net of federal benefit  of million related to state research tax credits 
these state tax credits have no expiration date and may be carried forward indefinitely 
the determination of whether it is more likely than not that we will realize the full benefit of our deferred tax assets  including the deferred tax asset related to the state research tax credits  requires significant judgment and estimates 
these estimates may include projections of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction and the amount of tax credits to be generated in future periods 
such estimates are subject to uncertainty due to various factors  including the economic environment  industry and market conditions  and the length of time of the projections included in the analyses 
if our actual results are less favorable than current estimates  we revise our estimates downward in future analyses  or we conclude that we expect to generate more state research tax credits than we can utilize for an indefinite period  a valuation allowance may be required with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the period in which such determination is made 
as of march   based upon our estimates  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the full benefit of the existing deferred tax asset related to these state research tax credits 
given the global scope of our operations and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations  it is difficult to estimate earnings within each tax jurisdiction 
if actual earnings within each tax jurisdiction differ materially from our estimates  we may not achieve our expected effective tax rate 
additionally  our effective tax rate may be impacted by other items  including the tax effects of acquisitions and dispositions  changes to tax laws or regulations  examinations by tax authorities  stock based compensation  uncertain tax positions and changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased to million as of march  from million as of april  as of march  and april   our international subsidiaries held million and million  respectively  of our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
these holdings by our international subsidiaries as of march  consisted primarily of debt securities due from us issuers  including the us government and related agencies  and 
table of contents us dollar denominated cash and money market funds 
certain foreign regulations could impact our ability to transfer funds to the united states 
we currently intend to reinvest the funds held outside of the united states in our international operations and  as a result  do not intend to repatriate these funds 
should we decide to repatriate funds held outside of the united states  we may incur a significant tax obligation 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and expected cash flow from operations will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to supplement our existing sources of liquidity to finance our activities beyond the next twelve months or for the future acquisition of businesses  products or technologies and there can be no assurance that sources of liquidity will be available to us at that time 
revolving credit facility in march  we entered into a credit agreement which provides us with a million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in march borrowings under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes  including permitted share repurchases and acquisitions 
under the credit agreement  we may increase the revolving commitments or obtain incremental term loans in an aggregate amount up to million  subject to certain conditions 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either a rate equal to i a base rate described in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio varying from to or ii an adjusted libo rate described in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio varying from to 
the credit facility also carries a commitment fee equal to the available but unused borrowing multiplied by an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio and the average daily used amount of the commitments varying from to 
the credit agreement includes financial covenants requiring a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum liquidity 
the credit agreement also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of march  operating  investing and financing activities cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal consisted of our net income of million and net non cash expenses of million  partially offset by net cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a million decrease in accrued taxes and a million decrease in accounts receivable 
the decrease in accrued taxes was primarily due to tax payments associated with the settlement of a significant matter in the irs examination 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of cash collections and a decrease in net revenues 
cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal consisted of our net income of million  including a million gain on sale of the ib business  and net non cash expenses of million  partially offset by net cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a million use of cash for accrued taxes  primarily due to estimated tax payments remitted during the fiscal year 
operating cash flow for fiscal consisted of our net income of million and net non cash expenses of million  partially offset by net cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a million decrease in 
table of contents accrued taxes and a million increase in inventories 
the decrease in accrued taxes was primarily due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation  the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and the timing of payment obligations 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to advanced purchases of silicon chips to maintain flexibility due to long lead times for these products 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of million of purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of million of net purchases of available for sale securities and million of purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of the ib business 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal and consisted primarily of million of net purchases of available for sale securities and million of purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by million of proceeds from the disposition of trading securities 
we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future as we continue to invest in more costly engineering and production tools for new technologies  machinery and equipment  and enhancements to our corporate information technology infrastructure 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase program  million for minimum tax withholdings paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock units that vested during the year  and million for debt issuance costs related to our new revolving credit facility  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and million for minimum tax withholdings paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock units that vested during the year  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and million for minimum tax withholdings paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock units that vested during the year  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
since fiscal  we have had various stock repurchase programs that authorized the purchase of up to billion of our outstanding common stock 
as of march   we had repurchased a total of million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs for an aggregate purchase price of billion 
pursuant to the existing stock repurchase program  we are authorized to repurchase shares with an aggregate cost of up to million as of march  contractual obligations and commitments we have certain contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of march   and their impact on our cash flows in future fiscal years  is as follows thereafter total in millions operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations 
table of contents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits  including related accrued interest and penalties  was million as of march  we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax payments related to these obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  including the current economic environment  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies 
these accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when all of the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent resale of the product 
however  certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements that contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
these return rights and price protection provisions limit our ability to reasonably estimate product returns and the final price of the inventory sold to distributors 
as a result  the price to the customer is not fixed or determinable at the time products are delivered to distributors 
accordingly  we recognize revenue from these distributors based on the sell through method using inventory information provided by the distributor 
at times  we provide standard incentive programs to our customers 
we account for our competitive pricing incentives and rebates as a reduction of revenue in the period the related revenue is recorded based on the specific program criteria and historical experience 
in addition  we record provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated product returns in the same period that revenue is recognized 
these provisions are based on historical experience as well as specifically identified product returns 
service and other revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is reasonably assured 
for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative selling price of the individual components 
when more than one element  such as hardware and services  are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative selling price  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the selling price  if it exists 
in order to establish vsoe of the selling price  we must regularly sell the product and or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority of the sales priced within a relatively narrow range 
if vsoe of the selling price cannot be determined  we then consider third party evidence tpe of the selling price 
generally  we are not able to determine tpe due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry 
if neither vsoe nor tpe exists  we determine the estimated selling price based on multiple factors including  but not limited to  cost  gross margin  market conditions and pricing practices 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria is met for each deliverable 
we sell certain software products and related post contract customer support 
we recognize revenue from software products when all of the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an 
table of contents arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is probable 
revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based upon vsoe of the fair value of the element 
vsoe of the fair value is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
if we are unable to determine vsoe of fair value for an undelivered element  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the service period or when all elements have been delivered 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and non employee directors  including stock options  restricted stock units and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan the espp  based on estimated fair values on the measurement date  which is generally the date of grant 
stock based compensation is recognized for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical trends and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for awards that are subject to only a service condition on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award  which is the vesting period for stock options and restricted stock units  and the offering period for the espp 
for all other stock based awards  stock based compensation is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
the determination of fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
in estimating expected stock price volatility  we use a combination of i historical volatility  calculated based on the daily closing prices of our common stock over a period equal to the expected term of the option  and ii implied volatility  utilizing market data of actively traded options on our common stock 
we believe that the historical volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term of the option is a strong indicator of the expected future volatility 
we also believe that implied volatility takes into consideration market expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
accordingly  we believe a combination of both historical and implied volatility provides the best estimate of the future volatility of the market price of our common stock 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock based awards 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are recognized in the first reporting period that it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period are derecognized in that period 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
we record potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
temporary differences include the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant judgment and estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is 
table of contents recorded 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
our estimates and projections require significant judgment and are subject to uncertainty due to various factors  including the economic environment  industry and market conditions  and the length of time of the projections included in the analyses 
if our actual results are less favorable than current estimates  or we revise our estimates downward in future analyses  a valuation allowance may be required with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the period in which such determination is made 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
investment securities investment securities include available for sale securities  trading securities and other investment securities 
our investment securities are classified in the consolidated balance sheets based on the nature of the security and the availability for use in current operations 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
unrealized gains and losses  net of related income taxes  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized 
trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings and reported in interest and other income  net 
in the absence of quoted market prices  these securities are valued based on an income approach using an estimate of future cash flows 
other investment securities are accounted for under the cost method and recorded at the lower of fair value or cost 
we recognize an impairment charge on available for sale securities when the decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  we would recognize the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is separated into a the amount representing the credit loss and b the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining the fair value of investment securities in inactive markets as well as determining when declines in fair value constitute an other than temporary impairment and the portion of any impairment that is due to a credit loss 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the current financial and credit market environment  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  the magnitude of the unrealized loss compared to the cost of the investment  the length of time the investment has been in a loss position and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of market value 
realized gains or losses are determined on a specific identification basis and reported in interest and other income  net  as incurred 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to estimated net realizable value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these assumptions are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
once we write down the carrying value of inventory  a new cost basis is established 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in an increase in the newly established cost basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization 
the amount assigned to in process research and development is capitalized and accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying projects are completed or abandoned 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment  by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  goodwill is considered impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we perform the annual test for impairment as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter 
during the annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal  we completed step one and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill since the fair value based on quoted market price of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
based on this impairment test  we believe that we have no at risk goodwill 
the initial recording and subsequent evaluation for impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets requires the use of significant management judgment regarding the forecasts of future operating results 
it is possible that our business plans may change and our estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results or estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than current estimates  we could incur impairment charges 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
significant judgment is required in determining whether a potential indicator of impairment of our long lived assets exists 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if such an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
estimating future net cash flows and determining proper asset groupings for the purpose of this impairment test requires the use of significant management judgment 
if our actual results  or estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than our current estimates  we could incur impairment charges
