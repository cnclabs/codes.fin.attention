item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the information described under the caption risk factors in part i  item a of this report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products  medical imaging systems and surgical products with an emphasis on serving the healthcare needs of women 
our core business units are focused on diagnostics  breast health  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
on august   we completed our acquisition of gen probe  which is part of our diagnostics business segment 
we offer a wide range of diagnostic products which are used primarily to aid in the diagnosis of human diseases and screen donated human blood 
our molecular diagnostics products include our aptima family of assays  our proprietary invader and tma chemistries and our advanced instrumentation panther  tigris and hta 
the aptima family of assays is used to detect the infectious microorganisms that cause the common stds chlamydia and gonorrhea  certain high risk strains of hpv  and trichomonas vaginalis  the parasite that causes trichomoniasis 
our invader chemistry is comprised of molecular diagnostic reagents used for a variety of dna and rna analysis applications  including our cervista hpv hr and cervista hpv products to assist in the diagnosis of hpv  as well as other products to diagnose cystic fibrosis  cardiovascular risk and other diseases 
our diagnostics products also include the thinprep system  which is primarily used in cytology applications such as cervical cancer screening  and the rapid fetal fibronectin test  which assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre term birth 
in blood screening  we develop and manufacture the procleix family of assays  which are used to detect hiv  hcv  hbv  wnv  hav and parvovirus in donated human blood 
these blood screening products are marketed worldwide by our blood screening collaborator  novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc  under novartis trademarks 
on november   novartis announced that it is selling its blood screening business to grifols 
grifols had previously been a customer of our collaboration with novartis 
as announced  the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of calendar upon the consummation of that transaction  grifols will replace novartis as our blood screening collaborator 
our breast health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories  including digital and film based mammography systems  breast mri coils  cad for mammography and minimally invasive breast biopsy devices  breast biopsy site markers  breast biopsy guidance systems  breast imaging comfort pads  and breast brachytherapy products 
our most advanced breast imaging platform  dimensions  utilizes a new technology called tomosynthesis to produce d images  as well as conventional d full field digital mammography images 
our gyn surgical products include our novasure system and myosure system 
the novasure system involves a trans cervical procedure for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding 
the myosure system is a tissue removal device that is designed to provide incision less removal of fibroids and polyps within the uterus 
at the end of the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to cease manufacturing  marketing and selling our adiana permanent contraception system determining that the product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future 
our skeletal health products include dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product  and our fluoroscan mini c arm imaging products 
unless the context otherwise requires  references to we  us  hologic or our company refer to hologic  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

table of contents recent developments market acceptance of our medical products in the united states and other countries is dependent upon the purchasing and procurement practices of our customers  patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs  private insurers or other healthcare payors 
in the united states  the centers for medicare medicaid services  known as cms  establish coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare providers treating medicare and medicaid beneficiaries 
under current cms policies  varying reimbursement levels have been established for certain of our products and treatments 
coverage and reimbursement policies and rates applicable to patients with private insurance are dependent upon individual private payor decisions which may not follow the policies and rates established by cms 
the use of our products and treatments outside the united states is similarly affected by coverage and reimbursement policies adopted by foreign governments and private insurance carriers 
cms has not adopted a reimbursement rate for the use of d tomosynthesis 
we are working with governmental authorities  healthcare providers  insurance companies and other third party payors in our efforts to secure reimbursement for the use of d tomosynthesis 
however  we can give no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
failure to obtain or delays in obtaining adequate reimbursement for the use of d tomosynthesis could adversely affect sales of our dimensions d systems 
the continuing uncertainty surrounding worldwide financial markets and macroeconomic conditions has caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease or delay their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities 
economic uncertainty as well as increasing health insurance premiums  deductibles and co payments have resulted and may continue to result in cost conscious consumers focusing on acute care rather than wellness  which has and may continue to adversely affect demand for our products and procedures 
furthermore  governments and other third party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered  which could adversely affect sales of our products 
if the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
in march  significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the united states 
the law includes provisions that  among other things  reduce and or limit medicare reimbursement  require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and imposes new and or increased taxes 
specifically  the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a excise tax on united states sales of certain medical devices effective january  the majority of our products fall under the government classification requiring the excise tax 
product sales in the united states represented and of our worldwide net product sales for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
since the effective date of the medical device excise tax through september   the company has incurred million of excise tax expense related to the domestic sales of its medical device products 
the law also includes new regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs  as well as stringent new reporting requirements of financial relationships between medical device manufacturers and physicians and hospitals 
we expect compliance with the new healthcare legislation  including these new reporting requirements and the new excise tax  to impose significant additional administrative and financial burdens on us 
various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level and in various foreign countries 
the healthcare reform legislation and these proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 
in addition  the excise tax has increased our cost of doing business 
these reforms  cost containment measures and new taxes  including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect  could also have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and other governmental actions may adversely affect our business  operations or financial condition  including  without limitation new laws  regulations or judicial decisions  or new interpretations of existing laws  regulations or decisions  related to healthcare availability  methods of delivery and payment for health care products and services  changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval 
table of contents processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity  changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring  labeling changes  restrictions on product distribution or use  or other measures after the introduction of our products to market  any of which could increase our costs of doing business  adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products  or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments  new laws  regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices  and changes in the tax laws relating to our operations  including those associated with the recently adopted healthcare reform law discussed above 
professional societies  government agencies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines  recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities from time to time 
recommendations of government agencies or these other groups organizations may relate to such matters as usage  cost effectiveness  and use of related preventative services and treatments therapies 
recommendations  guidelines or studies that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased reimbursement or use of our products 
for example  in november  the american congress of obstetrics and gynecologists  known as the acog  released updates in which they have recommended less frequent cervical cancer screening similar to guidelines released in march by the us preventative services task force  known as the uspstf  and the american cancer society 
however  the uspstf recommendations now also include hpv co testing for certain patient populations  an update from their draft guidelines in october overall  we believe that these guidelines have contributed to an increase in testing intervals in the us for cervical cancer screening  resulting in fewer such tests being performed 
over the last few years  there have been periodic significant fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
the ongoing fluctuations of the value of the us dollar may cause our products to be less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and profitability over time 
historically  a majority of our capital equipment sales to international dealers were denominated in us dollars 
however  more sales are now denominated in the euro compared to the us dollar for our euro zone dealers 
in addition  we have international sales  principally in our diagnostics segment  that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the value of these sales is also impacted by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets  foreign currency fluctuations may be significant in the future and we may experience a material adverse effect on our international revenues and operating results 
acquisitions fiscal acquisitions chindex medical limited on december   we acquired certain assets from chindex medical limited for a net purchase price of million  including contingent consideration 
chindex was a distributor of certain of our breast health products in china 
we accounted for this transaction as the acquisition of a business pursuant to asc and allocated the majority of the purchase price to customer relationships 
senorx  inc on may   through the settlement of litigation  we acquired certain assets related to senorx s contura brachytherapy device for a net purchase price of million 
we accounted for this transaction as the acquisition of a business pursuant to asc and allocated the majority of the purchase price to developed technology 

table of contents fiscal acquisitions gen probe incorporated on august   we completed the acquisition of gen probe and acquired all of the outstanding shares of gen probe 
pursuant to the merger agreement  each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the acquisition was cancelled and converted into the right to receive in cash 
in addition  all outstanding restricted shares  restricted stock units  performance shares  and those stock options granted prior to february  were cancelled and converted into the right to receive per share in cash less the exercise price  as applicable 
stock options granted after february  were cancelled and converted into stock options to acquire shares of hologic common stock determined by a conversion formula defined in the merger agreement 
the total purchase price was billion  which was funded through available cash and financing consisting of senior secured credit facilities and senior notes resulting in aggregate proceeds of billion  net of discounts 
the allocation of the purchase price was based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of august  the purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on management s estimate of their fair values 
certain of gen probe s assets were designated as assets held for sale and recorded at fair value less the estimated cost to sell such assets and were disposed of in fiscal these represented non core assets to our business plan 
as part of the purchase price allocation  we determined the identifiable intangible assets were developed technology of billion  in process research and development of million  customer contracts of million  and trade names of million 
the fair value of the intangible assets was estimated using the income approach  specifically the excess earning method and relief from royalty method  and the cash flow projections were discounted using rates ranging from to 
the cash flows were based on estimates used to price the transaction  and the discount rates applied were benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return from the transaction model and the weighted average cost of capital 
the developed technology assets comprised know how  patents and technologies embedded in gen probe s products and related to currently marketed products and related instrument automation 
in valuing the developed technology assets consideration was only given to products that had received regulatory approval 
in process research and development projects relate to in process projects that have not reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and have no alternative future use 
the primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying product  which primarily pertains to receiving approval to perform certain diagnostic testing on gen probe s instrumentation  such as the panther and tigris systems 
we recorded million of in process research and development projects related to six projects 
three projects valued at million received fda approval in fiscal and were transferred to developed technology 
the other projects are expected to be completed over the next four years with a total estimated cost of approximately million to complete such projects 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we can give no assurance that any of our product development efforts will be successful  completed on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
all of the in process research and development assets were valued using the multiple period excess earnings method approach using a discount rate of 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired of billion was recorded to goodwill 
the factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill were based on several strategic and synergistic benefits that were expected to be realized from the gen probe acquisition 
these benefits included the expectation that the combined company s complementary products in the molecular diagnostics market with gen probe s fully automated product franchise would significantly broaden the company s offering in women s health and diagnostics 
the combined company should benefit from a broader global presence and with hologic s direct sales force and marketing in europe and its investment in china distribution  the growth prospects of gen probe s products are expected to be enhanced significantly 
the combined company anticipates significant cross selling opportunities within the diagnostics market through hologic s larger channel coverage and physician sales team 
none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents gen probe s revenue and pre tax loss from continuing operations for the period from the acquisition date to september  were million and million  respectively 
fiscal acquisitions tct international co  ltd 
on june   we acquired tct international co  ltd  or tct  a privately held distributor of medical products  including our thinprep pap test  related instruments and other diagnostic and surgical products 
tct s operating subsidiaries are located in beijing  china 
our acquisition of tct enabled us to obtain an established nationwide sales organization and customer support infrastructure in china as we execute on our strategy to expand internationally 
the purchase price was million 
in addition  the majority of the former shareholders of tct were eligible to receive two annual contingent earn out payments subject to adjustment not to exceed million less a deferred payment of million  which was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal subsequent to the acquisition date  our results of operations include the results of tct  which are primarily reported within our diagnostics reporting segment and to a lesser extent within our gyn surgical reporting segment 
the contingent earn out payments were based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth for the one year periods beginning january  and january  as compared to the respective prior year periods 
since these payments were contingent on future employment  they were recognized as compensation expense ratably over the required service periods 
based on actual and projected revenues for the tct business  we recorded compensation expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the first earn out period was completed in the third quarter of fiscal and we paid million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the second earn out period was completed in the third quarter of fiscal  and we paid million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of september   we had accrued million  which we paid in november interlace medical  inc on january   we acquired interlace medical  inc  or interlace  a privately held company located in framingham  massachusetts 
interlace is the developer  manufacturer and supplier of the myosure system 
the purchase price was comprised of million in cash  which was net of certain adjustments  plus two annual contingent payments up to a maximum of an additional million in cash 
subsequent to the acquisition date  our results of operations include the results of interlace  which has been integrated within our gyn surgical reporting segment 
the agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of a portion of legal expenses in defense of the interlace intellectual property 
we have the right to collect certain amounts set aside in escrow from the initial consideration and  as applicable  offset contingent consideration payments with qualifying legal costs 
the contingent payments were based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during a two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
pursuant to asc  business combinations  we recorded this liability at its estimated fair value based on future revenue projections of the interlace business under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
as of the date of acquisition  these cash flow projections were discounted using a rate of  based on the weighted average cost of capital of the acquired business plus a credit risk premium for non performance risk related to the liability pursuant to asc this analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of million  which was adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in the fair value of the liability due to the accretion of the liability for the time value of money and changes in the assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined revenue growth milestones 
this fair value measurement was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a level measurement as defined in asc during 
table of contents the second quarter of fiscal  the first measurement period lapsed resulting in a total contingent consideration amount recorded for this period of million  which was disbursed to the former shareholders of interlace net of amounts withheld for certain legal indemnification purposes 
the final measurement period ended during the second quarter of fiscal  resulting in a contingent consideration liability of million  of which  million was paid to the former interlace stockholders in the second quarter of fiscal the remainder was withheld for legal indemnification provisions and is being used to pay qualifying legal expenses 
we recorded charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability 
beijing healthcome technology company  ltd 
on july   we completed our acquisition of beijing healthcome technology company  ltd  or healthcome  a privately held manufacturer of medical equipment  including mammography equipment  located in beijing  china 
healthcome develops and manufactures analog mammography products targeted to lower tier hospital segments in china 
the purchase price was million in cash 
in addition  we were obligated to make future payments to the shareholders  who remained employed  up to an additional million over three years 
since these payments were contingent on future employment  they were being recognized as compensation expense ratably over the respective service periods 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we and the former shareholders agreed that the former shareholders would terminate their employment 
we agreed to pay the majority of the contingent consideration in accordance with the original payment terms 
as a result  we accelerated the unearned compensation in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded compensation expense of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales diagnostics breast health gyn surgical skeletal health diagnostics product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe s product sales acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which contributed million of additional revenue in fiscal  partially offset by lower thinprep revenues of million and fiscal had one less week than fiscal  which was a week fiscal period 
the decline in thinprep revenue was primarily due to lower domestic volumes and  to a lesser extent  lower average selling prices internationally 
we attribute the domestic volume decline to an increase in testing intervals as a result of recent screening recommendations from governmental agencies and professional organizations 
we also experienced lower average selling prices in china  at least in part  due to restructuring the sales channel as we move toward using a combination of dealers and our direct sales force to gain broader market coverage compared to principally a direct sales strategy in fiscal however  international thinprep unit volumes were higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal we also experienced a decrease in our rapid fetal fibornecton test revenue of million compared to the prior year primarily due to lower domestic volumes 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in revenues of million primarily from our sale of cervista hpv products primarily in the united states  as we continue to gain new customer accounts and increase unit sales to existing customers 
the inclusion of gen probe s results is partially impacted by the novartis collaboration 
pursuant to the collaboration  a portion of gen probe s revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by novartis 
as a result  amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by novartis customers as of the date of our acquisition of gen probe were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations 
in fiscal and fiscal this contingent revenue of million and million  respectively  was not recognized in our results of operations 
we expect to experience modest price erosion in our molecular diagnostics products in fiscal breast health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal our digital mammography systems revenue increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in our d dimensions systems revenue of million in fiscal compared to fiscal as we sold more d dimensions units with higher average selling prices in the united states  partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices internationally 
partially offsetting the increase in d dimensions sales in fiscal  we had lower unit sales and  to a lesser extent  lower average selling prices of our d dimensions systems and selenia systems on a worldwide basis 
we also experienced a decline in sales of related components and workstation products of million in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily because customers that upgrade to d dimensions do not always require new versions of these related products 
our breast biopsy products revenue increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in the number of eviva biopsy devices sold in the united states and  to a lesser extent  internationally  and an increase in the number of celero devices sold in the united states 
partially offsetting these increases was a decline in the unit sales and average selling price of our atec devices  which we attribute to the introduction and increased sales of our eviva biopsy devices 
additionally  in fiscal  we experienced an million 
table of contents decline in revenue from our organic photoconductor materials business as this non core product line continues to experience pricing pressures in a competitive market space 
we decided to phase out this product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and we expect the phase out process to be completed in fiscal gyn surgical product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the decline in sales of novasure devices of million and an million decrease due to the discontinuance of adiana system sales 
in addition  fiscal had one less week than fiscal these decreases were partially offset by an increase in myosure system sales  including our new aquilex fluid management system used with our myosure devices  of million 
we experienced a decrease in the number of novasure devices sold in the united states  which we primarily attribute to the continuing effect of unemployment and economic uncertainty and the trend toward higher insurance co payments and deductibles  resulting in cost conscious patients delaying surgery or opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives 
partially offsetting this decrease  we sold more units internationally in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the discontinuance of adiana system sales was due to our decision to cease manufacturing  marketing and selling the product as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal  determining it was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future 
the increase in myosure system revenue in fiscal was substantially due to an increase in units sold domestically offset slightly by lower average selling prices due to the introduction of new variations of the primary myosure device compared to fiscal skeletal health product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decline of million in our osteoporosis assessment system sales worldwide and lower average selling prices internationally  partially offset by an increase in mini c arm sales of million  primarily due to the introduction of our new insight fd product 
in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
the increase in product sales in the united states as a percent of consolidated product sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe and to a lesser extent higher sales of our d dimensions systems 
the increase in european product sales as a percent of consolidated product sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe product sales in europe and  to a lesser extent  a higher percentage of selenia system unit sales to total sales in that region 
service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in our breast health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in the installed base of our digital mammography systems 
in addition  the inclusion of gen probe contributed an additional million  primarily comprised of other revenue  in fiscal compared to fiscal partially offsetting these increases was one less week in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets product sales gross margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization expense and charges for additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in the current fiscal year increased moderately in diagnostics and slightly in breast health and decreased in gyn surgical and to a lesser extent in skeletal health compared to the prior year  resulting in an overall increased rate in fiscal compared to fiscal diagnostics gross margin rate declined in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the inclusion of gen probe  which included million of additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting in fiscal compared to million of such costs in fiscal we also recorded impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to write down certain instruments and related inventory due to our plan to transition certain customers to our panther instrumentation from our hta instrument 
in addition  gen probe s gross margin since acquisition has been lower than its historical gross margin rate primarily due to the purchase accounting effect on our collaboration agreement with novartis in our blood screening business 
based on the novartis collaboration terms  a portion of gen probe s revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by novartis  however  gen probe recognizes the full product cost upon shipment 
as a result  amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by novartis customers as of the acquisition date were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations 
this contingent revenue not recognized in our results of operations was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
also contributing to the decline in the diagnostics gross margin rate was a decline in domestic thinprep sales and lower average selling prices in china and other international markets  unfavorable manufacturing and overhead variances  higher service costs  depreciation of equipment at customer sites  and distribution costs 
breast health experienced a slight decrease in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the lower gross margin rate in our breast biopsy business from higher sales of our eviva disposable  which carries lower gross margins due to higher manufacturing costs and royalty costs compared to our atec disposable  and lower average selling prices of our atec disposables domestically 
we also experienced unfavorable absorption and higher production spend for this line of business primarily due to the transfer of our manufacturing lines from indianapolis to costa rica  resulting in production of some of our breast biopsy products at two facilities 
once the transfer is complete  which is expected in fiscal  these devices will be produced solely in costa rica 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in unit sales and average selling prices of our d dimensions systems in the united states coupled with a decrease in our d digital systems sales as a percentage of total unit sales in fiscal compared to fiscal this d digital systems decrease was primarily related to our selenia system and  to a lesser extent  our d dimensions systems 
selenia systems have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our dimensions systems 

table of contents the gyn surgical gross margin rate in fiscal increased compared to fiscal due to favorable manufacturing absorption and the discontinuance of the adiana system in fiscal  offset by the impact of lower novasure system sales 
the adiana system had a much lower gross margin rate compared to the novasure and myosure systems 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined the adiana product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future 
as a result  we ceased manufacturing  marketing and selling our adiana system and recorded a charge of million in fiscal for the write off of inventory  manufacturing equipment and equipment at customer sites  and contractual purchase orders for which there was no expected future use of the materials and components 
in addition  the improved gross margin in fiscal is partially due to the increase in myosure system sales and the transfer of its production to costa rica  which has resulted in overall lower production costs 
skeletal health had a slightly higher gross margin rate in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to favorable product mix 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows 
the increase in amortization expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe  which accounted for million of additional expense  partially offset by fiscal having one less week compared to fiscal cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that a developed technology asset was impaired  primarily due to our decision to cease selling and providing support for such product 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million to record the asset at its fair value 
cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues service and other revenues gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal within our breast health segment  the continued conversion of a high percentage of our domestic installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period without a corresponding increase in costs to service such contracts has resulted in higher gross margins  partially offset by increased warranty  higher spare parts and additional headcount costs 

table of contents operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets contingent consideration compensation expense contingent consideration fair value adjustments impairment of goodwill gain on sale of intellectual property acquired in process research and development restructuring and divestiture charges research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to million of additional expense from the inclusion of gen probe 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in compensation and benefits from lower headcount and bonus expense in the legacy hologic businesses 
in addition  expenses were lower in fiscal due to a decrease in prototype materials and consulting expense based on the status and timing of various projects and the discontinuance of adiana development projects in fiscal research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs  regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials 
at any point in time  we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to million of additional expense from the inclusion of gen probe  higher compensation for additional sales personnel worldwide  and integration costs related to the gen probe acquisition 
in fiscal  we also had higher marketing spend for our initiatives related to our d dimensions tomosynthesis products and myosure system  and higher training and traveling expenses for our increased sales personnel headcount 
partially offsetting these increases in fiscal was the absence of expenditures for our novasure direct to consumer advertising campaign  which was completed in fiscal  the discontinuance of the adiana system in fiscal  decreased expenditures for international trade shows  meetings and medical education and a reduction of headcount in the second half of fiscal in addition  there was one less week in fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to million of additional expense from the inclusion of gen probe  integration costs related to the gen probe acquisition  the medical device excise tax of million  higher compensation and benefits  and an increase in information technology service contracts from an increase of licenses  partially offset by lower acquisition transaction costs to third parties and lower consulting costs as well as a reduction in headcount in the second half of fiscal in fiscal  these increases were partially offset by legal settlement benefit of million  lower bad debt expense due to a writeoff of an international account in the prior year  and lower charges for sales and other non income tax audits as compared to fiscal in addition  there was one less week in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships  trade names  business licenses and non compete agreements related to our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe  which accounted for million of additional expense  partially offset by one less week in fiscal compared to fiscal contingent consideration compensation expense 
in connection with certain of our recent acquisitions  we are obligated to make contingent earn out payments 
amounts recorded in this financial statement line item are those contingent payments that are contingent on future employment 
these payments are also generally based on achieving certain performance milestones  typically incremental revenue growth  as was the case for our tct acquisition 
the amounts recorded in fiscal relate solely to tct  and in fiscal  primarily relate to tct 
the measurement period for the tct earn out was completed in fiscal contingent consideration fair value adjustments 
in connection with our acquisitions of sentinelle medical and interlace  we were required to pay future consideration that was contingent on achieving certain revenue based milestones 
as of each respective acquisition date  we recorded contingent consideration liabilities for the estimated fair value of the amount we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business 
this liability was not contingent on future employment and was based on future revenue projections of the respective businesses under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
at each reporting period  we re measured the fair value of these liabilities and recorded the changes in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted from accretion of the liability for the passage of time  changes in discount rates  and changes in the timing  probabilities and amount of revenue estimates 
the sentinelle medical final measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and as a result the charges recorded in fiscal relate solely to interlace 
we recorded a charge of million in fiscal reflecting an increase in the fair value of the liability due to higher revenues for interlace than estimated 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to an increase in estimated interlace revenues resulting in a charge of million offset by a benefit of the sentinelle medical liability of million due to a reduction in estimated revenues 
the measurement period for the interlace earn out was completed in fiscal impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of our company wide annual budgeting and forecasting process and a full re evaluation of our existing product development efforts and cost structure  we reduced our short term and long term revenue forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our molecular diagnostics reporting unit 
the molecular diagnostics reporting unit is primarily comprised of our aptima business acquired in the gen probe acquisition and the molecular diagnostics business acquired in the third wave acquisition 
the updated forecast  which reflects recent pricing pressures  is now lower  and the current projections for revenue and profitability are lower than those expected at the time of the gen probe acquisition 
as such  the fair value of this reporting unit declined 
as a result of performing step of the goodwill impairment test  which requires the completion of a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the fair value of the implied goodwill  we recorded a billion goodwill impairment charge 
no other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our mammosite reporting unit  which is included in our breast health segment 
the fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal primarily due to our reassessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and long term growth projections 
no other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal for additional information  refer to note intangible assets and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
gain on sale of intellectual property 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a net gain of million related to the sale of our makena assets to k v pharmaceutical company  or kv 
on august  
table of contents kv and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of title of the united states code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
we had been pursuing our claims against kv in these proceedings for amounts due under our agreement with kv  and in december  we and kv executed a settlement agreement  which became effective on december  under the settlement agreement  we released kv from all claims in consideration of a million payment

acquired in process research and development 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired certain research and development assets that were determined to have no future alternative use and recorded a million charge within our gyn surgical segment 
restructuring and divestiture charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with our acquisition of gen probe  we implemented a restructuring action to consolidate our diagnostics operations by decreasing headcount and transferring our legacy molecular diagnostics operations in madison  wisconsin to san diego  california 
we also finalized our decision to transfer production of our interventional breast products from our indianapolis facility to our costa rica facility 
in addition  we transfered our selenium panel coating production line from germany to newark  delaware 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we implemented additional restructuring actions to reduce expenses which included terminating employees 
pursuant to us generally accepted accounting principles  the majority of severance and benefit charges are being recognized ratably over the respective required employee service periods  and in certain circumstances we are recording charges pursuant to contractual or statutory requirements 
other charges  such as facility closure costs are being recognized as incurred 
in fiscal and  we recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  which were primarily comprised of severance and related benefits  including stock compensation for acceleration of equity awards

interest income 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount investment and interest income interest income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to lower rates on funds invested in sweep accounts 
interest expense 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest expense interest expense consists primarily of the cash interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs on our convertible notes  amounts outstanding under our credit agreement  and senior notes 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to debt borrowed under the credit agreement and sale of senior notes in connection with our gen probe acquisition in 
table of contents the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we incurred additional expenses of million related to our retirement  pursuant to separate  privately negotiated exchange agreements  of million in aggregate principal of our convertible notes due  or the notes  for million in aggregate principal of new convertible notes due  or the notes 
this exchange enabled us to extend the first put date to december  as well as the subsequent put dates  as disclosed in the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis  with the conversion price of the notes remaining at approximately 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the original principal amount  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on june and december of each year  ending on december  and accrete principal  which we will accrue as an additional interest expense  from their date of issuance at a rate of per year until and including december   and per year thereafter 
since the exchange was a modification for accounting purposes  the issuance costs were expensed and not capitalized 
in addition  in fiscal  we incurred additional expenses of million and million related to our refinancing of the term loan a tranche and term loan b tranche under the credit agreement  respectively  which lowered the interest rates on these facilities by basis points and basis points  respectively 
the majority of the refinancings was accounted for as a modification for accounting purposes and the pro rata amount of issuance costs were expensed and not capitalized 
partially offsetting this increase was lower amortization of our convertible notes debt discount 
debt extinguishment loss 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount debt extinguishment loss in the second quarter of fiscal  we refinanced the term loan a tranche of the credit agreement and certain existing creditors opted not to participate in such refinancing 
as a result  the pro rata share of the original debt discount and issuance costs related to these creditors aggregating million was recorded as a debt extinguishment loss 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we refinanced the term loan b tranche of the credit agreement and made a voluntary prepayment of million of principal 
as a result  the pro rata share of the original debt discount and issuance costs related to the total principal paydown of million was recorded as a debt extinguishment loss 
in the second quarter of fiscal  pursuant to separate  privately negotiated exchange agreements  we retired million in aggregate principal of our notes for million in aggregate principal of new convertible notes due  or the notes 
this exchange enabled us to extend the first put date to march  as well as the subsequent put dates as disclosed in the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis 
in consideration  the equity conversion price of the notes was reduced to approximately from  and the cash coupon payment period was extended four and a quarter more years  consistent with extending the first put date  instead of accreting the coupon to the principal as required under the original terms 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a debt extinguishment loss of million  which includes the write off of the pro rata allocation of deferred financing costs 
other income expense  net 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount other income expense  net 
table of contents in fiscal  this account was primarily comprised of gains on our investments for our deferred compensation plan  including the cash surrender of life insurance contracts  of million  a million gain on the sale of a cost method investment  million from insurance and investment recoveries  and net foreign currency exchange gains of million 
partially offsetting these gains were other than temporary impairment charges for cost method investments of million 
in fiscal  this account was primarily comprised of gains on the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan of million  net foreign currency transaction gains of million  and other miscellaneous gains 
benefit provision for income taxes 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount benefit provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was of the pretax loss compared to of the pretax loss in fiscal for fiscal  the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the non deductible goodwill impairment charge  non deductible contingent consideration expense related to the tct and interlace acquisitions and unbenefited foreign losses  partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit and the release of a million valuation allowance related to capital losses utilized to offset capital gains generated during the year 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was significantly impacted by non deductible contingent consideration compensation expense related to the tct  interlace and sentinelle medical acquisitions  nondeductible acquisition costs  a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge  and a net increase in income tax reserves and valuation allowances on certain foreign losses 
the unfavorable tax impact of these items was partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit and a loss claimed related to the discontinuance of the adiana product line 
the effect of these permanent items to the effective tax rate was magnified by the fiscal pre tax loss 
segment results of operations we report our business as four segments diagnostics  breast health  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
diagnostics 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating loss operating loss as a of segment revenue 
table of contents diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above  which is principally attributable to the inclusion of gen probe for a full year 
operating loss for this business segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of billion recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to our molecular diagnostics reporting unit discussed above 
while gross margin in absolute dollars increased in fiscal due primarily to the inclusion of gen probe as discussed above  higher operating expenses  excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge  more than offset the gross margin impact 
the gross margin rate decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  which is primarily attributable to the inclusion of gen probe for the full year and incremental charges related to developed technology intangible asset amortization expense of million and inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting of million 
in addition  we recorded impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter to write down certain instruments and related inventory due to our plan to transition certain customers to our panther instrumentation from our hta instrumentation 
gross margin was also impacted by lower thinprep volumes in the us and lower average selling prices in china and other international markets  unfavorable manufacturing and overhead variances  higher service costs  depreciation of equipment at customer sites  and distribution costs 
operating expenses  excluding the goodwill impairment charge noted above  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe  which contributed an incremental million of expenses comprised of research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative and amortization expense 
in addition  this segment incurred incremental charges and expenses for restructuring of million  tct contingent consideration expense of million  medical device excise taxes of million and integration and retention costs 
partially offsetting these increases were reductions in headcount  bonus expenses  international trade shows and marketing initiatives and project spend in the legacy hologic businesses 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a net gain of million related to the settlement with kv for the sale of our rights to makena discussed above  and in the prior year second quarter  we recorded a net gain of million related to the makena sale 
breast health 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating income operating income as a of segment revenue breast health revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the million increase in service revenue and the million in product revenues discussed above 
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in gross margin dollars from higher revenues discussed above and lower operating expenses 
in fiscal  the overall gross margin rate increased to compared to in the prior year 
the product gross margin rate decreased slightly to in fiscal compared to in fiscal as discussed above 
operating expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a gain on the settlement of class action litigation of million  lower clinical trials spend  lower compensation from 
table of contents headcount reductions  and lower corporate allocations due to the gen probe acquisition 
partially offsetting these decreases were incremental restructuring charges of million  and the medical device excise tax of million 
gyn surgical 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating income loss operating income loss as a of segment revenue gyn surgical revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the decrease in product sales discussed above 
operating income for this business segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  gross margin in absolute dollars increased compared to fiscal primarily because fiscal included million of charges recorded in cost of product sales related to the discontinuance of the adiana system discussed above 
the gross margin rate improved to from in fiscal gross margin also improved primarily due to higher sales of our myosure system  which was partially offset by a reduction in novasure system sales and higher intangible asset amortization expense of million 
operating expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due a reduction in interlace contingent consideration charges of million  a reduction in advertising expenditures for our novasure system s direct to consumer advertising campaign which ended in fiscal  lower legal expenses primarily relating to a lawsuit settlement in fiscal  lower marketing  medical education and research and development expenses due to the discontinuance of the adiana product line  and lower compensation due to headcount reductions 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded charges for an ongoing sales tax audit 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher spend on developing the next generation novasure device  marketing initiatives for the myosure system and the medical device excise tax of million 
skeletal health 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating income operating income as a of segment revenue skeletal health revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in product sales of million discussed above and reduction in service revenues of million 
operating income decreased in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses 
higher operating expenses were primarily driven by restructuring charges of million and the medical device excise tax of million 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics gyn surgical skeletal health in fiscal  breast health product revenues increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in our breast biopsy products revenue of million as a result of an increase in the number of eviva and celero biopsy devices sold in the united states 
in addition  our digital mammography systems revenue increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily attributable to an increase in the number of units sold of both of our d and d dimensions products worldwide  partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices internationally in fiscal partially offsetting the increase in revenues from the dimensions systems was a decrease in the number of selenia systems sold worldwide and  to a lesser extent  a slight deterioration of average selling prices  and a continued shift in selenia product mix and configuration differences 
we sold more selenia performance models  which have fewer features than our base selenia model  which is a full featured model  and carry lower average selling prices 
in addition  we sold more selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total selenia systems  and average selling prices were lower in our international markets compared to the domestic market 
we also had an additional million in revenue in fiscal from our new trident product 
diagnostics product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe  which contributed million in revenue  and an increase of million in thinprep pap tests revenue 
the thinprep increase was principally from an increase in the sales price of thinprep in china as well as higher volumes from the inclusion of revenues of tct our former distributor in that country acquired in the third quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of thinprep pap tests sold in other international markets  partially offset by a decline in domestic units sold 
the inclusion of gen probe s results is partially impacted by the novartis collaboration 
pursuant to the collaboration  a portion of gen probe s revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by novartis  however  gen probe recognizes the full product cost upon shipment 
as a result  amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by novartis customers as of the acquisition date were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations 
in fiscal  this contingent revenue of million was not recognized in our results of operations 
we also experienced growth in our legacy molecular diagnostics products  which contributed a revenue increase of million in fiscal as we continued to gain new customer accounts and unit sales to existing customers and increase our international sales through tct 
in addition  in fiscal  we sold more diagnostics instruments internationally  increasing revenue by million 
revenues also increased slightly due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal was a week year compared to fiscal  which was a week year 
gyn surgical product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the myosure system  which contributed an increase of million of revenue in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in novasure devices revenue of million in fiscal in addition  revenues also increased slightly due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal while we experienced an 
table of contents increase in the number of novasure devices sold internationally  these increases were more than offset by a decline in the number of novasure devices sold domestically  and lower average selling prices driven by product mix and more international sales 
we believe the decline in the number of novasure devices sold in the united states is primarily attributable to the continued effect of unemployment and economic uncertainty  which has resulted in patients delaying surgery or opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives 
in addition  adiana system revenues declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal the reduction in adiana system revenues was due to our decision to cease manufacturing  marketing and selling the product as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal  determining it was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future 
skeletal health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million of our mini c arm systems as a result of our new insight system introduced in  and an increase of million in osteoporosis assessment product sales internationally 
in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in our breast health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in our installed base of our digital mammography systems  which were no longer under warranty  and an extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets product sales gross margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal as discussed below 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal in fiscal cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues increased in gyn surgical and diagnostics  declined slightly in breast health and remained relatively flat in skeletal health compared to fiscal  resulting in an overall lower gross margin rate in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents the gyn surgical gross margin rate in fiscal declined primarily due to charges of million related to our decision to shut down our adiana product line 
on april   we announced that we were ceasing to manufacture  market and sell the adiana system  determining that the product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future 
the charge related to the write off of inventory  manufacturing equipment and equipment at customer sites  and contractual purchase orders for which there was no expected future use of the materials and components 
in addition  lower sales of the novasure system resulted in a lower gross margin rate  which was partially offset by the shift of sales to our myosure system compared to lower margin adiana system sales 
for additional information pertaining to the adiana product line discontinuance charges  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
the diagnostics gross margin rate in fiscal declined compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe results  which included million of additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting  higher service costs and depreciation of equipment at customer sites  and distribution costs 
gen probe s gross margin since acquisition was lower than its historical gross margin rate due to the purchase accounting effect on our collaboration agreement with novartis in our blood screening business 
based on the novartis collaboration terms  a portion of gen probe s revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by novartis  however  gen probe recognizes the full product cost upon shipment 
as a result  amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by novartis customers as of the acquisition date were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and were not recorded as revenue in our results of operations 
in fiscal  this contingent revenue of million was not recognized in our results of operations 
partially offsetting these cost increases were higher thinprep pap test volumes resulting in lower fixed overhead costs per unit  favorable manufacturing variances  and the increase in sales price in china attributable to our acquisition of tct 
in fiscal  breast health s gross margin rate increased slightly compared to fiscal the gross margin rate for our digital mammography systems increased due to higher sales of our d dimensions systems  which have higher average selling prices and gross margins than our selenia systems  and an increase in d tomosynthesis software upgrades 
partially offsetting the improvement was an increase in selenia performance systems sales as a percent of total selenia system sales compared to the prior year 
our selenia performance systems have lower gross margins than our full featured selenia systems 
we also sold more selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total selenia systems where average selling prices are lower compared to the domestic market 
also offsetting the overall increase in breast health s gross margin was the sales mix within our breast biopsy products as we sold more eviva disposables and less atec disposables as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year 
eviva disposables have a lower gross margin than our atec disposables because they have a higher manufacturing cost and carry additional royalty charges 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology and patents 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows 
the increase in amortization expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the inclusion of technology assets acquired in our gen probe acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal and from our interlace acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  there was an increase in amortization expense due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal amortization was also higher due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues service and other revenues gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margin decreased due to additional expenses incurred related to international expansion  which has resulted in the hiring of additional service personnel  increasing compensation and travel costs worldwide 
in addition  service costs increased in our diagnostics segment due to an increase in our installed base of thinprep processors and imagers 
operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets contingent consideration compensation expense contingent consideration fair value adjustments impairment of goodwill gain on sale of intellectual property acquired in process research and development restructuring and divestiture charges research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe  which accounted for million of additional expenses 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in compensation and benefits due to lower bonus expenses  and a reduction in clinical trials and regulatory costs  which was primarily a result of the status and timing of projects 
research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs  regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal these increases were primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of gen probe  which accounted for million of additional expense  and the inclusion of tct for a full year  an increase in the number of sales personnel in the gyn surgical business segment  an increase in compensation and benefits and higher commissions  continuing product launch activities related to our d dimensions product  and higher travel expenses 
these expenses were also higher due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was partially offset by lower expenditures for our direct to consumer advertising campaign for novasure 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher acquisition related transaction costs associated with the gen probe acquisition of million  additional expenses  including retention costs  from the inclusion of gen probe of million  integration and consulting costs related to the gen probe acquisition  an increase in bad debt expense internationally  charges for an ongoing state sales tax audit  an increase in our deferred compensation plan  or dcp  liability  which is driven by the underlying market changes of hypothetical investments  and higher invoice collection fees from higher credit card payments 
these expenses were also higher due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by an overall decrease in compensation and benefits due to lower bonus expense and lower stock compensation expense as higher valued restricted stock units fully vested in fiscal and lower depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships  trade names  business licenses and non compete agreements related to our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets from the gen probe acquisition  a full year of amortization from the interlace and tct acquisitions  and an increase in amortization due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in fiscal amortization was also higher due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal contingent consideration compensation expense 
in connection with our recent acquisitions  excluding gen probe  we are obligated to make contingent earn out payments 
amounts recorded in this financial statement line item are those contingent payments that are contingent on future employment 
these payments are also generally based on achieving certain performance milestones  typically incremental revenue growth  as is the case for tct 
the amounts recorded in fiscal relate to tct and  to a lesser extent  healthcome 
amounts recorded in fiscal primarily relate to tct and interlace 
we recorded charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
for additional information  refer to the prior section titled acquisitions and to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
contingent consideration fair value adjustments 
in connection with our acquisitions of sentinelle medical and interlace  we were required to pay future consideration that is contingent on achieving certain revenue based milestones 
as of each respective acquisition date  we recorded contingent consideration liabilities for the estimated fair value of the amount we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business 
this liability was not contingent on future employment and was based on future revenue projections of the respective businesses under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
at each reporting period  we re measured the fair value of these liabilities and recorded the changes in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities could result from accretion of the liability for the passage of time  changes in discount rates  and changes in the timing  probabilities and amount of revenue estimates 
in fiscal  we recorded a net charge of million reflecting an increase in the fair value of the interlace liability of million due to higher revenue estimates  partially offset by a benefit of million related to sentinelle medical due to actual revenues being less than those estimated 
we recorded a net benefit of million in fiscal reflecting a net decrease in the fair values of these liabilities comprised of a reduction in the fair value of the sentinelle medical liability of million due primarily to changes in revenue assumptions offset by a charge of million related to interlace based primarily on the accretion of the liability to the expected payment amount 
for additional information  refer to the prior section titled acquisitions and to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our mammosite reporting unit  which is included in our breast health segment 
the fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal primarily due to our reassessment in the fourth quarter of

abandonment of adiana product line at the end of the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to cease manufacturing  marketing and selling our adiana system  which was a product line within our gyn surgical reporting segment 
we determined that the product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we settled the intellectual property litigation regarding the adiana system with conceptus as discussed below under contingent earn out payments 
as a result  in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million and recorded additional adjustments in fiscal resulting in an aggregate charge of million

the unfavorable tax impact of these items was partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction benefit and a loss claimed related to the discontinuance of the adiana product line 
the effect of these permanent items to the effective tax rate was magnified by the fiscal pre tax loss 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
table of contents less than the statutory rate primarily due to reversing income tax reserves  the domestic production activities deduction benefit and us and canadian research and development tax credits

cash provided by operations included a net cash inflow of million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by a decrease in inventory of million due to improved inventory management relative to demand  a decrease in prepaid income taxes of million due to income tax refunds  and an increase in deferred revenue of million due to an increase in service contracts from our higher installed base of digital mammography systems 
these cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million due to the timing of payments

contingent earn out payments 
in connection with certain of our acquisitions  we have the obligation to make contingent earn out payments tied to performance criteria  principally revenue growth of the acquired businesses over a specified period 
in certain circumstances  such as a change of control  a portion of these obligations may be accelerated 
in addition  contractual provisions relating to these contingent earn out obligations may include covenants to operate the acquired businesses in a manner that may not otherwise be most advantageous to us 
these provisions may also result in the risk of litigation relating to the calculation of the amount due or our operation of the acquired business 
such litigation could be expensive and divert management attention and resources 
our obligation to make contingent payments may also result in significant operating expenses 
depending upon the particular facts and circumstances giving rise to the payment and our previous estimates  all or a portion of these payments may be required to be expensed by us when accrued 
for example  our contingent earn out obligations payable in connection with the tct acquisition were expensed as accrued because our obligation to make these payments was conditioned on the continued employment of certain key employees of tct 
our contingent consideration arrangements are recorded as either additional purchase price or compensation expense if continuing employment is required to receive such payments 
pursuant to asc  contingent consideration that is deemed to be part of the purchase price is recorded as a liability based on the estimated fair value of the consideration we expect to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business as of the acquisition date 
this liability is re measured each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from accretion of the liability for the passage of time  changes in discount rates  and changes in the timing  probabilities and amount of revenue estimates 
contingent consideration arrangements from acquisitions completed prior to the adoption of asc effective in fiscal for us that are deemed to be part of the purchase price of the acquisition are not subject to the fair value measurement requirements of asc and are recorded as additional purchase price to goodwill

see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  certain of our cost method equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies  we have not included these future potential payments in the table above 

table of contents future liquidity considerations we expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions and alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business 
subject to the risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this annual report and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward looking statements at the outset of this annual report  we believe that cash flow from operations and the cash available under our revolving facility will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected normal operations  debt payments  including interest and deferred taxes as applicable  and contingent consideration obligations over the next twelve months 
our longer term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  repayment of debt  acquisitions or other investments  or to repay our convertible notes and related deferred tax liabilities 
as described above  we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreement  senior notes and convertible notes 
these capital requirements could be substantial 
our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above referenced risk factors set forth elsewhere in this report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long term liquidity 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims 
in connection with these legal proceedings and claims  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with asc  contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  valuations  purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations  expected future cash flows including growth rates  discount rates  terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  warranty reserves  certain accrued expenses  restructuring and other related charges  stock based compensation  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete 
table of contents or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures on products and prices  and reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product expiration or end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  excess or obsolete  we would be required to record impairment charges within cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  including a dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  and evaluation of the customer s current financial situation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  for example as a result of the ongoing financial and economic uncertainty or otherwise  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
contingent consideration  which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment  is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition 
the value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios  which are generally probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario 
these cash flow projections are discounted with an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
quarterly until such contingent amounts are earned  the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded 

table of contents the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management  which consider management s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
pursuant to asc  we capitalize these assets and record them in our consolidated balance sheet 
under asc  in process research and development assets are evaluated for impairment similar to goodwill and once the project is complete  if at all  the asset is amortized over its remaining useful life 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole and impairments may result 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
we have also used the income approach  as described above  to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology  customer relationships and contracts  and trade names 
developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know how 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
trade names represent acquired company and product names 
for business licenses  we use a combination of the lost profits method and replacement cost method to value such assets 
business licenses allow us to conduct business in a certain country  namely china 
with respect to property  plant and equipment  we estimate the fair value of these assets using a combination of the cost and market approaches  depending on the component 
generally  we apply the cost approach as the primary method in estimating the fair value of land and buildings as the market approach is less reliable based on potential significant differences between the property being valued and the potentially comparable sales of similar properties 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed 
the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing fair value  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally 
table of contents calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process  we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our mammosite reporting unit  which is included in the breast health reportable segment 
the impairment indicators were due to a reduction in our revenue projections and long term growth rates as a result of the continuing deterioration of the brachytherapy market and competition from existing technologies 
our cash flow estimates were based upon historical cash flows  as well as future projected cash flows derived from the company wide annual planning process 
the analysis indicated that mammosite s long lived assets were recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the predominant long lived asset 
we believe that our procedures for estimating future cash flows were reasonable and consistent with market conditions at the measurement date 
goodwill we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate  operational performance of the business or key personnel  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter 
in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and ratio comparisons of similar companies 
we base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  of market participants 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
the second step requires us to perform a hypothetical purchase allocation as of the measurement date and estimate the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets 
the fair value of intangible assets is determined as described above and is subject to significant judgment 
we conducted our fiscal annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter 
we utilized discounted cash flows  or dcf  and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june  and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf in making our impairment test conclusions 
we believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue  cost projections  cash flows  market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date 
as a result of completing step  all of the reporting units  except for our molecular diagnostics reporting unit  which is within our diagnostics reportable segment  had fair values exceeding their carrying values  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required for those reporting units 
as a result of our company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process and a full re evaluation of our existing product development efforts and cost structure performed in the fourth quarter  we reduced our short term and long term revenue forecasts and determined that indicators of impairment existed in our molecular diagnostics reporting unit 
the molecular diagnostics reporting unit is primarily comprised of our aptima business acquired in the gen probe acquisition and the molecular diagnostics business acquired in the third wave acquisition 
the updated forecast  which reflects recent pricing pressures  is now lower  and the current projections for revenue and profitability are lower than those expected at the time of the gen probe acquisition 

table of contents as a result  the fair value of this reporting unit was below its carrying value 
we performed step of the impairment test  consistent with the procedures described above  and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion 
the basis of fair value for molecular diagnostics assumed the reporting unit would be purchased or sold in a taxable transaction  and the discount rate of applied to the after tax cash flows was relatively consistent with that used in our purchase accounting for the gen probe acquisition 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair value of molecular diagnostics been lower by  the company would have recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair value of each of our remaining reporting units been lower by  all of our other reporting units would have still passed step of the goodwill impairment test 
since the fair value of our reporting units was determined by use of the dcf  and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the wacc  terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  significant judgment is applied in determining fair value 
if the current economic environment were to deteriorate  this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return 
in the dcf as the wacc increases  the fair value decreases 
the other significant factor in the dcf is our projected financial information ie  amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted  this could result in a reduction of the fair value of this reporting unit 
at september   we believe that our other reporting units  with goodwill aggregating billion were not at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test based on the current forecasts 
we conducted our fiscal annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter 
we utilized dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june   and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf in making our impairment test conclusions 
we believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue  cost projections  cash flows  market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date 
as a result of completing step  all of our reporting units  except mammosite  which is within our breast health segment  had fair values exceeding their carrying values  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units 
mammosite s fair value declined from fiscal primarily due to a reduction in our revenue projections and long term growth rates 
the changes in mammosite s financial projections were a result of the continuing deterioration of the brachytherapy market  and competition from existing technologies 
we performed the step analysis for mammosite  consistent with the procedures described above  and recorded a million goodwill impairment charge  resulting in no remaining goodwill for this reporting unit 
for our other reporting units  if their respective fair values had been lower by  each reporting unit would have still passed step of the goodwill impairment test 
we conducted our fiscal annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter 
we utilized dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june   and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf in making our impairment test conclusions 
we believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue  cost projections  cash flows  market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date 
as a result of completing step  all of the reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair value of each reporting unit been lower by  each reporting unit would have still passed step of the goodwill impairment test 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of products  primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products  and related services  which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no right of return exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  our product arrangements for capital equipment sales  primarily in our breast health and skeletal health reporting segments  are multiple element arrangements  including services  such as installation and training  and multiple products 
in accordance with asc  based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we believe that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered products have value to our customers on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  revenue for services not yet performed at the time of product shipment are deferred and recognized as such services are performed 
the relative selling price of any undelivered products is also deferred at the time of shipment and recognized as revenue when these products are delivered 
there is no customer right of return in our sales agreements 
service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty  installation and training  and shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we record revenue as separate units of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control 
some of our products have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
we determined that except for our cad products and c view product  the software element in our other products is incidental in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules and are not within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules  asc  software revenue recognition 
we determined that given the significance of the software component s functionality to our cad and c view systems  which are sold by our breast health segment  these products are within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
we evaluated the appropriate revenue recognition treatment of our other hardware products  including our dimensions digital mammography systems  which have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality ie  it is a tangible product  and determined they are not within the scope of asc we are required to allocate revenue to multiple element arrangements based on the relative fair value of each element s selling price 
we typically determine the selling price of our products based on our best estimate of selling price  referred to as esp  and services based on vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  referred to as vsoe 
we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand alone basis 
in determining vsoe  our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range 
we also consider the class of customer  method of distribution  and the geographies into which our products and services are sold when determining vsoe 
if vsoe cannot be established  which may occur in instances when a product or service has not been sold separately  stand alone sales are too infrequent  or product pricing is not within a narrow range  we attempt to establish the selling price based on third party evidence of selling price  referred to as tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
when we cannot determine vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand alone sale of the product or service 
esp is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies  internal costs and gross margin objectives  method of distribution  information gathered from experience in customer negotiations  market research and information  recent technological trends  competitive landscape and geographies 

table of contents for those arrangements accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules  asc generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on their relative vsoe of fair value 
if vsoe does not exist for a delivered element  the residual method is applied in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their vsoe with the remaining consideration recognized as revenue for the delivered elements 
for multiple element software arrangements where vsoe of fair value of post contract customer support  referred to as pcs  has been established  we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
as part of our diagnostics reporting segment and as a result of the gen probe acquisition  we manufacture blood screening products according to demand schedules provided by our collaboration partner  novartis 
our agreement provides that we share a portion of novartis s revenue from screening blood donations 
upon shipment to novartis  we recognize blood screening product sales at an agreed upon fixed transfer price  which is not refundable  and record the related cost of products sold 
based on the terms of our collaboration agreement with novartis  our ultimate share of the net revenue from sales to the end user in excess of the transfer price revenues recognized is not known until it is reported to us by novartis 
on a monthly basis  novartis reports net revenue generated during the prior month and remits an additional corresponding net payment to us which we record as revenue at that time 
this payment combined with the transfer price revenues previously recognized represents our ultimate share of net revenue under the agreement 
we sell our instruments to novartis for use in blood screening and record these instrument sales upon delivery since novartis is responsible for the placement  maintenance and repair of the units with its customers 
we also sell instruments to our clinical diagnostics customers and record sales of these instruments upon delivery and customer acceptance 
for certain customers with non standard payment terms  instrument sales are recorded based upon expected cash collection 
prior to delivery  each instrument is tested to meet the company s specifications and the specifications of the fda  and is shipped fully assembled 
customer acceptance of the company s clinical diagnostic instrument systems requires installation and training by our technical service personnel 
installation is a standard process consisting principally of uncrating  calibrating and testing the instrumentation 
within our diagnostics business and  to a lesser extent  our surgical business  we provide our instrumentation for example  the thinprep processor  thinprep imaging system  panther and tigris and certain other hardware to customers without requiring them to purchase the equipment or enter into a lease 
instead  we recover the cost of providing the instrumentation and equipment in the amount we charge for our diagnostic tests and assays and other disposables 
customers enter into a customer usage agreement  and we install the equipment at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price over a defined contract term  which is typically between three and five years 
revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as tests  assays and other disposable products are shipped 
the depreciation costs associated with an instrument are charged to cost of product sales on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the instrument 
the costs to maintain these instruments in the field are charged to cost of product sales as incurred 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the fair value of stock options and restricted stock units issued to our employees 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we use a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options including the advice of an outside valuation advisor and the advisor s model 
the model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
we currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility  which is weighted based on a number of factors 

table of contents expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
asc  stock compensation  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we have determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and have applied forfeiture rates ranging from to as of september  depending on the specific employee group 
this analysis is re evaluated periodically and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was due to the addition of personnel and assumed stock options in the gen probe acquisition and the acceleration of vesting for certain terminated employees 
as of september   there was million and million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units  respectively  that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years and years  respectively 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between our assets and liabilities financial reporting and taxes bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we have recognized billion in net deferred tax liabilities at september  and billion at september  the liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and debt 
the tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accruals and reserves  stock based compensation  and research credits 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine that we could realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
we had million in gross unrecognized tax benefits  excluding interest  at september  and million at september  the gross unrecognized tax benefits increased million in fiscal primarily due to a million increase related to the convertible note exchange in the second quarter of fiscal at september   million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in a reduction of the company s effective tax rate 
in the next twelve months  it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by to million due to statute of limitations expiring and favorably settling with taxing authorities  both reducing our effective tax rate 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
while we consider our 
table of contents estimates reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different than amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exist 
asu amends the presentation requirements of asc  income taxes  and requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward  similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward 
to the extent the tax benefit is not available at the reporting date under the governing tax law or if the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose  the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability and not combined with deferred tax assets 
the asu is for annual periods  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the amendments are to be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date and may be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
under asu  an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
the asu is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu amended asc  balance sheet  to converge the presentation of offsetting assets and liabilities between us gaap and ifrs 
asu requires that entities disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after january   which is our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  a publicly traded equity security  cost method equity investments  mutual funds  insurance contracts and related deferred compensation plan liabilities  accounts payable and debt obligations 
except for our outstanding convertible notes and senior notes  the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
as of september   we have billion of principal of convertible notes outstanding  which are comprised of our notes with a principal of million  our notes with a principal of million  our notes with a principal of million  and our notes with a principal of million 
the convertible notes are recorded net of the unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of our notes  notes  notes and notes as of september  was approximately million  million  million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior notes was approximately billion 

table of contents amounts outstanding under our credit agreement aggregating billion aggregate principal as of september  are subject to variable rates of interest based on current market rates  and as such  we believe the carrying amount of these obligations approximates fair value 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposure is in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we incur interest expense on borrowings outstanding under our convertible notes  senior notes and credit agreement 
the convertible notes and senior notes have fixed interest rates 
borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum  at our option  initially  with respect to all loans made under term loan a i at the base rate plus per annum  or ii at the adjusted eurodollar rate ie  the libor rate plus  and with respect to loans made under term loan b i at the base rate  with a floor of  plus  or ii at the adjusted eurodollar rate  with a floor of plus as of september   there was billion of aggregate principal outstanding under the credit agreement comprised of million under the term loan a facility and billion under the term loan b facility 
since these debt obligations are variable rate instruments  our interest expense associated with these instruments is subject to change 
a adverse movement increase in libor rate would increase annual interest expense by less than million due to the low current interest rate environment and the floor on our term loan b facility 
the return from cash and cash equivalents will vary as short term interest rates change 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we conduct business worldwide and maintain sales and service offices outside the united states as well as manufacturing facilities in costa rica  germany  england  canada and china 
the expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies  except at our costa rica subsidiary  where the majority of the business is conducted in us dollars 
our international sales are denominated in a number of currencies  primarily the euro  us dollar and renminbi 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our sales  cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in the euro are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the euro 
our expenses  denominated in euros  are positively affected when the us dollar strengthens against the euro and adversely affected when the us dollar weakens 
however  we believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not significant 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currencies that we transact in would not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we incurred net foreign exchange gains losses of million  million and million  respectively
