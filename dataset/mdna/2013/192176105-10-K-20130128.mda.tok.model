overview we are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the united states and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes  preferences and price points 
as a result  we believe that we are well positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles of the coffee market and economic conditions 
our operations have primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry the sale of wholesale specialty green coffee  the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of private label coffee  and the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of our seven brands of coffee 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the level of marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  fluctuations in purchase prices and supply of green coffee and in the selling prices of our products  and our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins 
our net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
for this reason  we have made  and will continue to evaluate  strategic decisions to invest in measures that are expected to increase net sales 
these transactions include our acquisitions of premier roasters  llc  including equipment and a roasting facility in la junta  colorado  a west coast brand manager to market our s w brand and to increase sales of s w coffee to new customers  our joint venture with caruso s coffee  inc of brecksville  ohio the transaction with organic products and the addition of three sales persons from the caf bustelo division of folgers to assist with the expansion of our caf caribe and supremo brands 
we believe these efforts will allow us to expand or business 
our net sales are affected by the price of green coffee 
we purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the united states 
the dealers supply us with coffee beans from many countries  including colombia  mexico  kenya  indonesia  brazil and uganda 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
for example  in brazil  which produces approximately of the world s green coffee  the coffee crops are historically susceptible to frost in june and july and drought in september  october and november 
however  because we purchase coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one country s coffee for another in our products  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee 
accordingly  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
historically  because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers  increased prices of green coffee generally result in increased net sales 
we have used  and continue to use  short term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our cost of sales 
in addition  we acquire futures contracts with longer terms  generally three to four months  primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices 
although the use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices  no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time 
in addition  we would remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts 
if the hedges that we enter into do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses  our cost of sales may increase  resulting in a decrease in profitability  as occurred in the three month periods ended july  and october  see item business our use of derivatives 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  assets held for sale  income taxes and loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  may be impacted significantly by judgment  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements we recognize revenue in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance 
revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers which is upon the shippers taking possession of the goods because i title passes in accordance with the terms of the purchase orders and with our agreements with our customers  ii any risk of loss is covered by the customers insurance  iii there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement  iv the sales price is determinable and v collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
thus  revenue is recognized at the point of shipment 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments 
if there is deterioration of our customers credit worthiness and or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used  additional allowances may be required 
for example  every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible  would decrease our operating income by approximately  for the year ended october  the reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated discount that customers will take upon payment 
the reserve for other allowances represents the estimated amount of returns  slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by us from our customers 
inventories are stated at lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions  inventories are subject to be written down to market value 
if our assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
each additional one percent of potential inventory writedown would have decreased operating income by approximately  for the year ended october  we account for income taxes in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized 
accordingly  our net deferred tax asset as of october  of  may require a valuation allowance if we do not generate taxable income 
our goodwill consists of the cost in excess of the fair market value of the acquired net assets of optco 
this company has been integrated into a structure which does not provide the basis for separate reporting units 
consequently  we are a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
we also have intangible assets consisting of customer list and relationships and trademarks acquired from optco 
at october  our balance sheet reflected goodwill and intangible assets as set forth below october  customer list and relationships  net trademarks goodwill goodwill and the trademarks which are deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
goodwill impairment tests require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units 
we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
upon completion of such review  if impairment is found to have occurred  a corresponding charge will be recorded 
the value assigned to the customer list and relationships is being amortized over a twenty year period 
because the company is a single reporting unit  the closing nasdaq capital market price of our common stock as of the acquisition date was used as a basis to measure the fair value of goodwill 
goodwill and the intangible assets are tested annually at the end of each fiscal year to determine whether they have been impaired 
upon completion of each annual review  there can be no assurance that a material charge will not be recorded 
impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment or decline in value may have occurred

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices as further described below 
interest rate risks 
we are subject to market risk from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of october   our debt consisted of  of variable rate debt under our revolving line of credit 
our line of credit provides for a maximum of  and is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate currently plus 
this loan is secured by tangible and intangible assets of the company 
commodity price risks 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
we have used  and continue to use  short term coffee futures and options contracts for the purpose of hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices as further explained in note of the notes to financial statements in this report 
in addition  we acquire futures contracts with longer terms  generally three to four months  for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of sales 
gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase our cost of sales 
the use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices 
we believe that  in normal economic times  our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales  but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while trying to minimize margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices 
however  no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time  and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts 
although we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past  we have incurred losses on options and futures contracts during some reporting periods 
in these cases  our cost of sales has increased  resulting in a decrease in our profitability 
such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease our profitability and adversely affect our stock price 
see item a risk factors if our hedging policy is not effective  we may not be able to control our coffee costs  we may be forced to pay greater than market value for green coffee and our profitability may be reduced 
as of october   we held future contracts for the purchase of  pounds of coffee at a weighted average price of per pound compared to future contracts for the purchase of  pounds of coffee at a weighted average price of per pound for the fiscal year ended october  the fair market value of coffee applicable to such contracts was and per pound  respectively
