year ended july  percentage change total net revenue gross profit gross margin income from operations operating margin net income diluted net income per share during fiscal year our total net revenue increased by as compared to the prior year due primarily to growth in sales in our medical imaging and security technology segments of and respectively  offset in part by ultrasound revenues which decreased in fiscal year gross margin improved in fiscal year versus the prior year was due to higher volume  more efficient global manufacturing processes and cost reductions 

table of contents income from operations increased in fiscal year from the prior year due primarily to our revenue growth and gross margin improvement along with overall cost control 
these results included expenses related to our acquisition of ultrasonix as well as restructuring expenses 
during march  we completed our acquisition of i all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of ultrasonix medical corporation  a nevada corporation  and customer lists and intangibles related solely to sales destined to the us and ii all of the outstanding equity securities of ultrasonix medical corporation ultrasonix  a privately held company located in vancouver  canada  pursuant to a plan of arrangement under canadian law 
ultrasonix is a supplier of advanced ultrasound systems for point of care and general imaging applications with over  systems installed worldwide 
we undertook the acquisition to accelerate our expansion into the point of care ultrasound market 
the purchase price  net of cash acquired  of  was finalized in july the acquisition was funded from our existing cash on hand and has been accounted for as an acquisition of a business 
during fiscal year  we incurred pre tax charges of  primarily relating to severance and personnel related costs of involuntarily terminated employees  as well as for facility exit costs associated with restructuring activities  including the consolidation of manufacturing and certain support activities currently conducted at the ultrasonix facility in vancouver  into operations at our existing facilities  closure of the ultrasonix sales subsidiary in paris  france  the transition costs associated with the planned closure of our englewood  colorado facility  as we consolidate manufacturing and development activities into our state college  pennsylvania facility  and optimization of our operations in montreal  canada and peabody massachusetts  all of which were recognized in our consolidated statement of operation under restructuring

in april  we invested  in pocketsonics  a start up company with proprietary ultrasound technology 
we have expensed   and  for engineering services from this start up company during fiscal years   and  respectively 
financing arrangements on october   we entered into a million five year  revolving credit agreement credit agreement with the financial institutions identified therein as lenders  which included sovereign bank  td bank  na  and hsbc bank usa  national association 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries as designated by us from time to time or as required under the credit agreement  and is supported by a pledge of of the capital stock and equity equivalents of our principal international subsidiary 
the credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be reduced before maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty 

table of contents borrowings under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes  including permitted acquisitions 
the amount of the facility can be increased under specified circumstances up to  in aggregate 
we are the sole borrower under the credit agreement 
interest rates on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility would range from to above the libor rate  or  if we do not elect the libor rate  from to above the defined base rate which is the highest of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus or one month libor plus  in each case based upon our leverage ratio 
a quarterly commitment fee ranging from to per annum is applicable on the undrawn portion of the credit facility  based upon our leverage ratio 
the credit agreement limits us and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  incur liens or guarantee obligations  pay dividends or make other distributions  make investments  dispose of assets  and engage in transactions with affiliates except on an arms length basis 
in addition  the credit agreement requires us to maintain the following financial ratios a leverage ratio  defined as consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated trailing four quarters ebitda of no greater than at any time  and an interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of consolidated trailing four quarters ebitda to consolidated interest charges of no less than at any time 
at july   our leverage ratio was and our interest coverage ratio was not applicable as we had no attributable interest expense 
as of july   we were in full compliance with all financial and operating covenants 
any failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants of the credit facility would prevent us from being able to borrow and would also constitute a default  permitting the lenders to  among other things  accelerate repayment of outstanding borrowings  including all accrued interest and fees  and to terminate the credit facility 
a change in control of us  as defined in the credit agreement  would also constitute an event of default  permitting the lenders to accelerate repayment and terminate the credit agreement 
in connection with the entering into this facility  we incurred approximately of transactions costs  which are being expensed over the five year life of the credit facility 
other funding commitments we currently also have approximately  in other revolving credit facilities with banks available for direct borrowings 
in connection with our acquisition of ultrasonix  we assumed of debt under a certain credit facility  all of which was paid as of july  in addition to the debt assumed  we borrowed  under this credit facility during the fiscal year  all of which was paid as of july  we did not have any borrowings outstanding under credit facilities as of july  and july  tax related obligations we have  of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and million of related accrued interest and penalties

impact of investigation regarding our danish subsidiary as initially disclosed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended july   we identified certain transactions involving bk medical and certain of its foreign distributors  with respect to which we have raised questions concerning compliance with law  including danish law and the us foreign corrupt 
table of contents practices act  and our business policies 
these have included transactions in which the distributors paid bk medical amounts in excess of amounts owed and bk medical transferred the excess amounts  at the direction of the distributors  to third parties identified by the distributors 
we have been unable to ascertain with certainty the ultimate beneficiaries or the purpose of these transfers 
we have voluntarily disclosed this matter to the danish government  the us department of justice  which we refer to as the doj  and the sec and are cooperating with inquiries by the danish government  the doj and the sec 
we are unable to estimate the potential penalties and or sanctions  if any  that might be assessed in connection with these matters 
we have concluded that the transactions identified to date have been properly accounted for in our reported financial statements in all material respects 
during fiscal year  we incurred inquiry related costs of approximately  in connection with this matter  as compared to  in fiscal year we have terminated the employment of certain bk medical employees and have wound down the relationships with the bk medical distributors that were involved in the transactions 
we incurred employee termination costs of and  respectively  in connection with this matter in fiscal years and revenue from sales to the bk medical distributors with whom we wound down bk medical s relationship represented less than of our total revenue in fiscal year  as compared to less than of our total revenue in fiscal year recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted presentation of comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued an update to the accounting on comprehensive income to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of us gaap  and international financial reporting standards  or ifrs 
this update requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
furthermore  this update does not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
this update is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and all periods thereafter and is applied retrospectively 
the adoption of this update did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
comprehensive income in january  the fasb issued an update which seeks to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income by requiring an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this update is effective for the annual or interim reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted this standard in the third quarter of fiscal year and this information is presented in note in our annual report on this form k 
the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
not yet effective testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in july  the fasb issued an update regarding testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this update gives an entity the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely 
table of contents than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 
an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the guidance is effective for our interim period ending october   and is not expected to have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
early adoption is permitted 
foreign currency matters in march  the fasb issued an update which amends guidance on foreign currency matters and consolidations to address diversity in practice related to the release of cumulative translation adjustments  or cta  into earnings upon the occurrence of certain derecognition events 
the update reflects a compromise between the cta release guidance included within foreign currency matters and the loss of control concepts included within consolidation guidance 
it precludes the release of cta for derecognition events that occur within a foreign entity  unless such events represent a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity 
derecognition events related to investments in a foreign entity result in the release of all cta related to the derecognized foreign entity  even when a noncontrolling financial interest is retained 
the update also amends guidance on business combinations and for transactions that result in a company obtaining control of a business in a step acquisition by increasing an investment in a foreign entity from one accounted for under the equity method to one accounted for as a consolidated investment 
the update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this update should be applied prospectively and prior periods should not be adjusted 
this update is not expected to have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year 
presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in july  the fasb issued an update which is intended to eliminate the diversity that is in practice with regard to the financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
the guidance is effective for our interim period ending january  the adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our most critical accounting policies  and the estimates involved in their application  have a significant impact on the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
these policies involve significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expense  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  the policies discussed below require management to make its most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments  often on matters that are inherently uncertain 
our estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note  summary of business operations and significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item  exhibits and financial statements schedule  of this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies require management to make the most difficult estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accordingly are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we provide engineering services to some of our customers on a contractual basis and recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the progress towards completion on contracts with a fixed fee arrangement on a monthly basis utilizing costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs at completion of the project or on a milestone basis based on contractual terms  as appropriate 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology for engineering services with a fixed fee arrangement involves uncertainties because it requires management to make estimates of our total estimated costs at completion of projects 
the timing of when revenue  profits  and loss reserves are recognized may fluctuate if changes to the estimates of costs at completion of projects are needed 
allocation of consideration in multiple element revenue arrangements we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
we determine selling price using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if it exists  and otherwise third party evidence tpe 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a unit of accounting  we use estimated selling price esp 
we generally expect that we will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of the markets in which we compete  and  as such  we typically will determine selling price using vsoe or if not available  esp 
if we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  and the order was received or materially modified after july   we use esp in the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product or service were sold by us on a standalone basis 
our determination of esp involves a weighting of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
specifically  we will consider the cost to produce the deliverable  the anticipated margin on that deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar parts  our ongoing pricing strategy and policies as evident in the price list as established and updated on a regular basis  the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of the inventory or market in a manner that approximates the first in first out method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  product life cycles  and changes in technology 
a variety of methodologies are used to determine the amount of inventory write downs necessary to adjust excess and obsolete inventory 
write downs are based upon the age of the inventory  lower of cost or market  along with significant management judgments concerning future demands for the inventory and technological obsolescence 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional write downs for existing inventories might be recorded in future periods 
once recorded  inventory adjustments are not subsequently reversed until the inventory is used or disposed of 
inventory includes demo equipment utilized by the sales force in the field 
our inventory write downs involve uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted customer demand  and technological obsolescence 
share based compensation we have share based compensation plans  which include stock options  restricted stock awards  and an employee stock purchase plan 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards  which include shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units  based on the quoted market price of our common stock or the use of a monte carlo simulation model 

table of contents we recognize the associated share based compensation expense for time based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeitures and are updated on the vesting dates to reflect actual forfeitures 
the amount of share based compensation expense for performance based unvested restricted stock awards that is recognized on a straight line basis over the performance period is based upon the number of shares that management ultimately expects to vest 
for performance based awards with an earnings per share related target  management evaluates the probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date and related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight line basis because such awards vest only at the end of the measurement period 
changes to the probability assessment and the estimate of shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change 
if the performance is not achieved  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
for performance based awards with a market condition related target  related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures  regardless of whether the awards are ultimately earned 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques to value restricted stock awards with market conditions require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
performance based non vested restricted stock awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving future company financial targets or personal performance goals 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the amount of compensation expense we recognize 
warranty reserves we estimate the costs of product warranties based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
our warranty reserve involves uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
business combinations we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting  which requires  with limited exceptions  that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
any excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
our methodology involves uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we conduct our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  which 
table of contents consider both the market approach and income approach for goodwill and the relief from royalty approach for the indefinite lived intangible assets under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on trading and acquisition multiples 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the relief from royalty approach  the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is based on after tax royalty rate and discount rate applied to future forecasted sales 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using the methodologies described herein  and determined there was no impairment 
the valuation analyses described above involve uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 
income tax contingencies our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record a liability for exposures subject to a minimum threshold of more likely than not before any benefit is recognized 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a liability  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits involves uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
deferred tax valuation allowances we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions within which we operate 
this process involves assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established 
our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in tax law  the tax jurisdiction of new business ventures  the level of earnings and where they came from  and the results of tax audits 
our deferred tax valuation allowances involve uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions based on historical data  future book income  and tax planning strategies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all dollar amounts in item a are in thousands 
certain of our foreign operations enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  primarily the us dollar and the euro 
we also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign operations to us dollars 
we generally view our investments in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar as long term 
the currencies to which we are exposed are the british pound  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  danish kroner  euro  and japanese yen 
a depreciation in the july  and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately  and  respectively 

table of contents as of july   we had forward contracts outstanding with notional amounts totaling  in the canadian dollar 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges  and the unrealized loss of  net of tax  on these contracts is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
liability and asset derivatives designated as hedging instruments are presented in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains losses on the cash flow hedges are recognized in income in the period when the payment of expenses is recognized 
during fiscal year and  we recorded approximately and of realized losses included in cost of revenues and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we expect all contracts currently outstanding to settle as of january  and any amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to be reported as an adjustment to operating expenses 
we place our cash and cash equivalents in high quality financial instruments and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution 
our cash includes cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
investments having original maturities in excess of three months are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair value  and are classified as held to maturity 
total net interest income for fiscal year and fiscal year was and  respectively 
a change in interest income or interest rate would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on future earnings
