critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the corporation s financial statements management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the most significant subjective judgments that it makes include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principals of accounting i accounting standards codification asc no 
contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii asc  receivables  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
an allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based upon industry standards  known risk characteristics  and management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
such evaluation considers  among other factors  the estimated market value of the underlying collateral and current economic conditions 
for further information about our practices with respect to allowance for loan losses  please see the subsection allowance for loan losses below 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities in the bank s investment portfolio are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale 
securities classified as held to maturity are recorded at cost or amortized cost 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
the estimated fair value of the available for sale portfolio fluctuates due to changes in market interest rates and other factors 
changes in estimated fair value are recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
securities are monitored to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management evaluates the investment portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine the collectability of amounts due per the contractual terms of the investment security 
a decline in the fair value of an investment below its amortized cost attributable to factors that indicate the decline will not be recovered over the anticipated holding period of the investment will cause the security to be considered other than temporarily impaired 
other than temporary impairments result in reducing the security s carrying value by the amount of the estimated credit loss 
the credit component of the other than temporary impairment loss is realized through the statement of income and the remainder of the loss remains in other comprehensive income 
at december  there were no securities in the securities portfolio with other than temporary impairment 
income taxes the corporation uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
the deferred provision for income taxes is the result of the net change in the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year 
this amount combined with the current taxes payable or refundable results in the income tax expense for the current year 
our evaluation of the deductibility or taxability of items included in the corporation s tax returns has not resulted in the identification of any material uncertain tax positions 
fair value fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions 
fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates  credit risk  prepayments and other factors  especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items 
changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates 
the fair value estimates of existing on and off balance sheet financial instruments do not include the value of anticipated future business or the values of assets and liabilities not considered financial instruments 
for additional information about our financial assets carried at fair value  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
executive summary the corporation completed its thirteenth year of operation and recorded net income of million or per diluted common share in compared to million or per diluted common share and million or per diluted common share in and  respectively 
the increase in net income over last year was due mainly to record performance during by the mortgage division 
in we were able to reduce interest expense by million or as the target federal funds rate remained at throughout which contributed to the lower interest expense 
in  gains realized from the sale of mortgage loans increased by million or from  while noninterest expense increased by million or 
the increase in net income during over was mainly due to record performance in the banking division

at december   assets totaled million compared to million at december  total loans held for investment were million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the growth in loans occurred in commercial real estate owner occupied  residential real estate and commercial loans and is due in part to our focus on small to medium sized businesses and providing credit facilities in conjunction with the us small business administration s sba guaranteed loan program

the sba lending activity is an important component of our focus on small businesses and expanding our core business relationships 
investment securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in the investment portfolio is primarily attributable to securities that matured or were otherwise called and not reinvested 
the funds not reinvested in investment securities were used to provide funding for the growth in our loan portfolio 
deposits totaled million at december  compared to million at december  noninterest bearing deposit balances totaled approximately million compared to million at december   an increase of 
this increase is primarily due to new business relationships and increased balances of existing clients 
non performing assets npa totaled approximately million or of total assets at december   down from million or of total assets at december  npas are comprised of non accrual loans solely  as at december   and  the corporation did not have any other real estate owned

the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total loans held for investment as of december   compared to million or at december  the economy continues to show signs of improvement with unemployment rates declining  and we are beginning to see price appreciation in the local residential real estate market 
notwithstanding the foregoing  there is no guarantee that these positive trends will continue 
although we believe that the credit quality of our primary business and professional customers has stabilized and has begun to improve  we will continue to focus on improving the credit quality of our loan portfolio and reducing non performing assets 
the corporation is optimistic going into with a strong capital base and being positioned for continued growth

the minor increase in the provision for loan losses between and is due to the growth in the loan portfolio rather than a decline in the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision is determined by management to restore the allowance for loan losses to a level believed to be adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on evaluations as of december  noninterest income noninterest income consists of revenue generated from gains on sale of loans  service fees on deposit accounts  and other charges and fees 
the mortgage division provides the most significant contributions towards noninterest income and is subject to wide fluctuations due to the general interest rate environment and economic conditions 
total noninterest income was million in compared to million in gains on the sale of loans originated by the mortgage division totaled million in compared to million in due to an increase in mortgage loan volume of million from to as well as an increase in the gains recognized in the secondary market 
mortgage broker fee income declined thousand in  from thousand in to thousand in due to a management decision to decrease the amount of loans obtained through brokers 
other income reflects a loss of million in  up from a loss of thousand in as a result of losses incurred on hedging activities associated with the origination of mortgage loans held for sale 
when losses occur on instruments used to hedge interest rate risk the value of the loans being hedged increases proportionately and is recognized in gains on the sale of loans 
total noninterest income was million in compared to million in gains on the sale of loans originated by the mortgage division totaled million in compared to million in mortgage loan volume decreased minimally from to  however  the increase in gains recognized in the secondary market allowed for the increase in the gain on the sale of the loans

noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million in compared to million in compensation and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase is due to a combination of increased staffing at the bank  primarily in the lending area  and an increase in performance based compensation in the mortgage division as a result of the increase in revenue generated in other operating expense totaled million in  up from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase is due mainly to increased management fees paid to mortgage branch managers  advertising and promotional expense  provision for loans held for sale and investor fees in the mortgage division as a result of its increased operations 
a further breakdown of other operating expenses is provided for in note of the consolidated financial statements

the increase in total assets was due mainly to a combination of a million increase in loans held for investment  a million increase in loans held for sale and a million increase in cash and due from banks that was offset by a million decrease in interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold and a million decrease in securities 
the following discussions by major categories explain the changes in financial condition 
cash and due from banks cash and due from banks represents cash and noninterest bearing balances at other banks and cash letters in process of collection at the frb 
at december  cash and due from banks totaled million compared to million at december  the balance fluctuates depending on the volume of cash letters in process of collection at the frb 
interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold at december  interest bearing balances in other banks totaled million compared to million at december  these balances are maintained at the frb and the fhlb of atlanta and provide liquidity for managing daily cash inflows and outflows from deposits and loans 
the reduction in interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold was used to fund loan growth 
investment securities the corporation s investment securities portfolio is comprised of us government agency securities  municipal securities  cra mutual fund  mortgage backed securities issued by us government sponsored agencies and corporate bonds 
the investment portfolio is used to provide liquidity and as a tool for managing interest sensitivity in the balance sheet  while generating income 
at december   securities totaled million compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
the decrease is attributable to maturities and bonds that were called and not reinvested in securities 
the proceeds from the maturing and called securities were used to fund loan growth 
the securities portfolio at december  is comprised of million in securities classified as available for sale and million in securities classified as held to maturity 
securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair market value 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded directly to a separate component of shareholders equity 
held to maturity securities are carried at cost or amortized cost

residential real estate loans increased million from the bank concentrates on providing banking services to small and medium sized businesses and professionals in our market area 
as of december  we did not have any exposure to builders or developers in our commercial real estate portfolio 
our loan officers maintain a professional relationship with our clients and are responsive to their financial needs 
they are directly involved in the community  and it is this involvement and commitment that leads to referrals and continued growth 
loans held for sale totaled million at december  compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the level of loans held for sale fluctuates with the volume of loans originated during the month and the timing of loans purchased by investors 
loan origination volume including brokered loans totaled billion in compared to million in due primarily to an increase in re financing activity as loan interest rates continued to decline throughout the following tables present the major classifications and maturity distribution of loans held for investment at december composition of loan portfolio year ended december  amount percentage of total amount percentage of total amount percentage of total amount percentage of total amount percentage of total dollars in thousands commercial real estate owner occupied  commercial real estate non owner occupied  residential real estate   commercial   real estate construction   consumer    total loans   loan maturity distribution year ended december  three months or over three months over one year over less through one year through five years five years total in thousands commercial real estate owner occupied   commercial real estate non owner occupied   residential real estate    commercial     real estate construction    consumer and other   total     loans with fixed interest rates    loans with floating interest rates   total     allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december  compared to million at year end the allowance for loan losses was equivalent to of total loans held for investment at december  and at december  adequacy of the allowance is assessed and increased by provisions for loan losses charged to expense no less than quarterly 
charge offs are taken when a loan is identified as uncollectible 
the methodology by which we systematically determine the amount of our allowance is set forth by the board of directors in our loan policy and implemented by management 
the results of the analysis are documented  reviewed and approved by the board of directors no less than quarterly 
the level of the allowance for loan losses is determined by management through an ongoing  detailed analysis of historical loss rates and risk characteristics 
during each quarter  management evaluates the collectability of all loans in the portfolio and ensures an accurate risk rating is assigned to each loan 
the risk rating scale and definitions jointly adopted by the federal banking regulators are used within the framework prescribed by the bank s loan policy 
any loan that is deemed to have potential or well defined weaknesses that may jeopardize collection in full is then analyzed to ascertain its level of weakness 
if appropriate  the loan may be charged off or a specific reserve may be assigned if the loan is deemed to be impaired 
during the risk rating verification process  each loan identified as inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged is considered impaired and is placed on non accrual status 
on these loans  management analyzes the potential impairment of the individual loan and may set aside a specific reserve 
any amounts deemed uncollectible during that analysis are charged off 
for the remaining loans in each segment  management calculates the probability of loss as a group using the risk rating for each of the following loan types commercial real estate owner occupied  commercial real estate non owner occupied  residential real estate  commercial  real estate construction  and consumer 
management calculates the historical loss rate in each group by risk rating using a period of at least five years 
this historical loss rate may then be adjusted based on management s assessment of internal and external environmental factors 
this adjustment is meant to account for changes between the historical economic environment and current conditions and for changes in the ongoing management of the portfolio which affects the loans potential losses 
once complete  management compares the condition of the portfolio using several different characteristics as well as its experience to the experience of other banks in its peer group in order to determine if it is directionally consistent with others experiences in our area and line of business 
based on that analysis  management aggregates the probabilities of loss of the remaining portfolio based on the specific and general allowances and may provide additional amounts to the allowance for loan losses as needed 
since this process involves estimates  the allowance for loan losses may also contain an immaterial amount that is not allocated to a specific loan or to a group of loans but is deemed necessary to absorb additional losses in the portfolio 
management and the board of directors subject the reserve adequacy and methodology to review on a regular basis to internal auditors and bank regulators  and such reviews have not resulted in any material adjustment to the reserve

the loans are carried at the current net realizable value after consideration of thousand in specific reserves 
included in non accrual loans at december  is a restructured commercial loan in the amount of thousand 
there were no restructured loans prior to the bank considers restructurings of loans to troubled borrowers when it is deemed to be beneficial to the borrower and improves the prospects for complete recovery of the debt 
the accrual of interest is discontinued at the time a loan is days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  accrued and unpaid interest is reversed from interest income 
subsequent receipts on non accrual loans are recorded as a reduction to the principal balance 
interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is complete 
the loss potential for each loan has been evaluated  and in management s opinion  the risk of loss is adequately reserved against 
management actively works with the borrowers to maximize the potential for repayment and reports on the status to the board of directors monthly 
deposits deposits totaled million at december  and were comprised of noninterest bearing demand deposits in the amount of million  savings and interest bearing deposits in the amount of million  and time deposits in the amount of million 
total deposits increased million from december  noninterest bearing deposits increased million from million at december  to million at december  this increase in noninterest bearing accounts is due to a combination of new accounts and increased balances in existing commercial accounts at year end 
savings and interest bearing deposit accounts increased million from million at december  to million at december  time deposits decreased million and totaled million at december  compared to million in the decrease in time deposits occurred primarily in deposits obtained through the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
we use wholesale funding or brokered deposits to supplement traditional customer deposits for liquidity and to maintain our desired interest rate risk position 
together with fhlb borrowings we use brokered deposits to fund the short term cash needs associated with the lhfs activities discussed under loans as well as other funding needs 
brokered deposits totaled million at december   which included million in cdars deposits as compared to million at december   which included million in cdars deposits 
through cdars our depositors are able to obtain fdic insurance of up to million 
the fdic currently classifies cdars deposits as brokered deposits  even though the deposits originate from our customers 
these deposits are placed at other participating financial institutions to obtain fdic insurance  and we receive a reciprocal amount in return from these financial institutions 
true brokered deposits have declined from million at december  to million at december  these deposits are not at premium rates and are frequently below retail interest rates 
brokered deposits are viewed by many as being volatile and unstable  however  unlike retail certificates of deposit  there are no early withdrawal options on brokered certificates of deposit for any reason other than death of the underlying depositors 
brokered deposits provide funding flexibility and can be renewed at maturity  allowed to roll off or increased or decreased without any impact on core deposit relationships 
we manage the roll over risk of all deposits by maintaining liquid assets in the form of interest bearing balances at the frb and fhlb as well as investment securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
in addition we also maintain lines of credit with the fhlb  frb  and correspondent banks 
at december  there was million available under these lines of credit 
depositors have been reluctant to extend maturities on certificates of deposits due to the low interest rate environment which has resulted in an increase in certificates of deposits maturing in the one year or less category 
we anticipate that we will renew these certificates of deposits depending on our current funding needs 
our asset liability committee monitors the level of re pricing assets and liabilities and establishes pricing guidelines to maintain net interest margins

banking regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the corporation and the bank are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the banking regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off the balance sheet 
both the corporation and bank are classified as well capitalized  which is the highest rating 
the table below presents an analysis of risk based capital and outlines the regulatory components of capital and risk based capital ratios for the corporation

the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining the corporation s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of both depositors and borrowers 
asset and liability management functions not only serve to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the corporation s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the corporation can earn an appropriate return for its shareholders 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and maturities of investment securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding 
at december   overnight interest bearing balances totaled million and securities available for sale totaled million 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
at december   the bank had a line of credit with the fhlb totaling million and a short term borrowing of million leaving approximately million available on the line 
in addition to the line of credit at the fhlb  the bank issues repurchase agreements 
as of december   outstanding repurchase agreements totaled million 
the interest rate on these instruments is variable and subject to change daily 
the bank also maintains federal funds lines of credit with its correspondent banks and  at december   these lines amounted to million 
the corporation also has million in subordinated debentures to support the corporation s operations 
the bank relies on deposits and other short and long term resources for liquidity from a variety of sources that substantially reduces reliance upon any single provider 
the corporation expects its short and long term sources of liquidity and capital to remain adequate to support expected growth 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the corporation s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to make future payments as of december  december  less than more than year years years total in thousands certificates of deposit    fhlb advances   securities sold under agreements to repurchase  subordinated debentures   leases  total     the corporation generates sufficient cash flows and has adequate resources to meet its contractual obligations 
we anticipate that substantially all of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed with the exception of certain brokered deposits that we intentionally will not be renewing 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase are likely to remain substantially the same as this item represents funds from overnight sweep agreements with our commercial checking customers 
off balance sheet items during the ordinary course of business  the bank issues commitments to extend credit and  at december   these commitments amounted to million 
included in this balance are million in performance standby letters of credit 
these commitments do not necessarily represent cash requirements  since many commitments are expected to expire without being drawn on 
the mortgage division had open forward contracts at december  totaling million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the mortgage division has agreements with a variety of counterparties to whom mortgage loans are sold on a non recourse basis 
as customary in the industry  the agreements require the mortgage division to extend representations and warranties with respect to program compliance  borrower misrepresentation  fraud  and early payment performance 
under the agreements  the counterparties are entitled to make loss claims and repurchase requests of the mortgage division for loans that contain covered deficiencies 
the overall economic conditions  continued high unemployment  and weak values in the housing market has created a heightened risk of loss due to the representations and warranties associated with sold mortgage loans 
the mortgage division has adopted a reserve methodology whereby provisions are made to an expense account to fund a reserve maintained as a liability account on the balance sheet for potential losses 
the amount of the provision and adequacy of the reserve is recommended by management and approved by the board no less than quarterly 
management estimates the reserve based upon an analysis of historical loss experiences and actual settlements with our counterparties 
a schedule of expected losses on loans with claims or indemnifications is maintained to ensure the reserve equals or exceeds the estimate of loss 
claims in process are recognized in the period received  actively monitored and subject to validation prior to payment 
often times  claims are not factually validated and the claim is rescinded 
once claims are validated and the actual or potential loss is agreed upon with the counterparty  the reserve is charged and a cash payment is made to settle the claim 
the loan performance data of sold loans is not always made available to the mortgage division by the counterparties  thereby making it difficult to estimate the timing and amount of claims until such time as claims are actually presented 
through careful monitoring and conservative estimates  the balance of the reserve has adequately provided for all claims since established 
at december  and the balance in this reserve totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishes policies to monitor and coordinate the corporation s sources  uses  and pricing of funds 
interest rate sensitivity management the corporation uses a simulation model to analyze  manage and formulate operating strategies that address net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and re pricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumption of certain assets and liabilities as of december  the model assumes changes in interest rates without any management intervention to change the composition of the balance sheet 
according to the model run for the period ended december   over a twelve month period an immediate basis points increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by 
an immediate basis points increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by 
a basis points decrease in interest rates would result in a negative variance in net interest income and is considered unlikely given current interest rate levels 
while management carefully monitors the exposure to changes in interest rates and takes actions as warranted to decrease any adverse impact  there can be no assurance about the actual effect of interest rate changes on net interest income 
the corporation s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the corporation manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its asset liability committee 
the asset liability committee meets monthly and has responsibility for formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and net income and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the mortgage division is party to mortgage rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans at interest rates previously agreed locked by both the mortgage division and the borrower for specified periods of time 
when the borrower locks his or her interest rate  the mortgage division effectively extends a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but the mortgage division must honor the interest rate for the specified time period 
the mortgage division is exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments and loans prior to sale 
the mortgage division utilizes either a best efforts sell forward or a mandatory sell forward commitment to economically hedge the changes in fair value of the loan due to changes in market interest rates 
failure to effectively monitor  manage  and hedge the interest rate risk associated with the mandatory commitments subjects the mortgage division to potentially significant market risk 
throughout the lock period the changes in the market value of interest rate lock commitments  best efforts and mandatory sell forward commitments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses and are included in the consolidated statement of income under other noninterest income 
the mortgage division utilizes a third party and its proprietary simulation model to assist in identifying and managing the risk associated with this activity 
impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a non financial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the bank s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
