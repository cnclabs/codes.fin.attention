item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations legislation and regulation 
the cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts 
the industry is facing increased pressure from anti smoking groups and continued smoking and health litigation  including class action litigation and health care cost recovery actions brought by governmental entities and other third parties  the effects of which  at this time  we are unable to evaluate 
as of december   there were approximately  engle progeny cases  individual product liability lawsuits  four purported class actions or actions where class certification has been sought  and one health care cost recovery action pending in the united states in which liggett and or vector were named defendants

risk factors  item legal proceedings and note to our consolidated financial statements  which contain a description of litigation 
it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco related litigation or as a result of additional federal or state regulation relating to the manufacture  sale  distribution  advertising or labeling of tobacco products 
liggett s management believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the laws regulating cigarette manufacturers 

table of contents the master settlement agreement and other state settlement agreements in march  march  and march  liggett entered into settlements of tobacco related litigation with states and territories 
the settlements released liggett from all tobacco related claims within those states and territories  including claims for health care cost reimbursement and claims concerning sales of cigarettes to minors

the msa also requires participating manufacturers to affirm corporate principles to comply with the msa and to reduce underage usage of tobacco products and imposes restrictions on lobbying activities conducted on behalf of participating manufacturers 
in addition  the msa provides for the appointment of an independent auditor to calculate and determine the amounts of payments owed pursuant to the msa 
under the payment provisions of the msa  the participating manufacturers are required to make annual payments of billion subject to applicable adjustments  offsets and reductions 
these annual payments are allocated based on unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments 
the payment obligations under the msa are the several  and not joint  obligation of each participating manufacturer and are not the responsibility of any parent or affiliate of a participating manufacturer 
liggett has no payment obligations under the msa except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately of total cigarettes sold in the united states

risk factors our business faces many risks 
we have described below the known material risks that we and our subsidiaries face 
there may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries 
each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition or equity of us or one or more of our subsidiaries  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports that we may file with the securities and exchange commission or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us 
we have significant liquidity commitments 
during  we have certain liquidity commitments that could require the use of our existing cash resources 
as of december   our corporate expenditures exclusive of liggett  vector tobacco and new valley and other potential liquidity requirements over the next months included the following cash interest expense of approximately million  dividends on our outstanding common shares currently at an annual rate of approximately million  and other corporate expenses and taxes 
in order to meet the above liquidity requirements as well as other liquidity needs in the normal course of business  we will be required to use cash flows from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents 
should these resources be insufficient to meet the upcoming liquidity needs  we may also be required to liquidate investment securities available for sale and other long term investments  or  if available  draw on liggett s credit facility 
while there are actions we can take to reduce our liquidity needs  there can be no assurance that such measures can be achieved 

table of contents we and our subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
we and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations 
at december   we and our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness of million 
approximately million of our convertible notes mature in we are required to offer to repurchase on june  the remaining million of our convertible debentures due we incurred an additional million of indebtedness in connection with our november offering of variable interest convertible notes due the convertible notes due are our senior unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the convertible notes due are also structurally subordinated to all liabilities and commitments of our subsidiaries 
we retired in february million of the million outstanding of our senior secured notes due the remaining million of our senior secured notes have been called and will be retired on march  we incurred an additional million of indebtedness in connection with the february offering of our senior secured notes due in addition  subject to the terms of any future agreements  we and our subsidiaries will be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
there is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt 
if we cannot service our fixed charges  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our high level of debt may adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations 
a default in our debt obligations  including a breach of any restrictive covenant imposed by the terms of our indebtedness  could result in the acceleration of the affected debt as well as other of our indebtedness 
in such a situation  it is unlikely that we would be able to fulfill our obligations under the debt or such other indebtedness or that we would otherwise be able to repay the accelerated indebtedness or make other required payments 
even in the absence of an acceleration of our indebtedness  a default under the terms of our indebtedness could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and on the trading price of our debt and our common stock 
our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations with respect to our debt  including repurchase obligations upon the occurrence of specified change of control events  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  reducing the amount of our cash flow available for dividends on our common stock and other general corporate purposes  require us to sell other securities or to sell some or all of our assets  possibly on unfavorable terms  to meet payment obligations  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions  investing in new capital assets or taking advantage of business opportunities  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt 
we are a holding company and depend on cash payments from our subsidiaries  which are subject to contractual and other restrictions  in order to service our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock 
we are a holding company and have no operations of our own 
we hold our interests in our various businesses through our wholly owned subsidiaries  vgr holding llc and new valley 
in addition to our own cash resources  our ability to pay interest on our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock depends on the ability of vgr holding and new valley to make cash available to us 
vgr holding s ability to pay dividends to us depends primarily on the ability of liggett  its wholly owned subsidiary  to generate cash and make it available to vgr holding 
liggett s revolving credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na contains a restricted payments test that limits the ability of liggett to pay cash dividends to vgr holding 
the ability of liggett to meet the restricted payments test may be affected by factors beyond its control  including wells fargo unilateral discretion  if acting in good faith  to modify elements of such test 
our receipt of cash payments  as dividends or otherwise  from our subsidiaries is an important source of our liquidity and capital resources 
if we do not have sufficient cash resources of our own and do not receive payments from our subsidiaries in an amount sufficient to repay our debts and to pay dividends on our common stock  we must obtain additional funds from other 
table of contents sources 
there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain additional funds at all or on terms acceptable to us 
our inability to service these obligations and to continue to pay dividends on our common stock would significantly harm us and the value of our common stock 
our senior secured notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility 
the indenture governing our senior secured notes due contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to take specific actions  even if we believe them to be in our best interest  including restrictions on our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  pay dividends or distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  create liens with respect to our assets  make investments  loans or advances  prepay subordinated indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  and merge  consolidate  reorganize or sell our assets 
in addition  liggett s revolving credit agreement requires us to meet specified financial ratios 
these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the indenture governing the senior secured notes and the liggett revolving credit agreement may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance  changes in general business and economic conditions  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants  including those contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes and the liggett s credit agreement  could result in a default under our indebtedness  which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable 
if any of our indebtedness is accelerated  we may not be able to repay it 
the indenture governing the senior secured notes contain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  restrict our ability to pay certain dividends or make other restricted payments or enter into transactions with affiliates if our consolidated ebitda  as defined in the indenture  is less than million for the four quarters prior to such transaction 
our consolidated ebitda for the four quarters ended december  exceeded million 
changes in respect of the debt ratings of our notes may materially and adversely affect the availability  the cost and the terms and conditions of our debt 
both we and several issues of our notes have been publicly rated by moody s investors service  inc  or moody s  and standard poor s rating services  or s p  independent rating agencies 
in addition  future debt instruments may be publicly rated 
these debt ratings may affect our ability to raise debt 
any future downgrading of the notes or our other debt by moody s or s p may affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the notes 
liggett faces intense competition in the domestic tobacco industry 
liggett is considerably smaller and has fewer resources than its major competitors  and  as a result  has a more limited ability to respond to market developments 
management science associates data indicate that the three largest cigarette manufacturers controlled approximately of the united states cigarette market during philip morris is the largest manufacturer in the market  and its profits are derived principally from its sale of premium cigarettes 
philip morris had approximately of the premium segment and of the total domestic market during during  all of liggett s sales were in the discount segment  and its share of the total domestic cigarette market was 
philip morris and rj reynolds  the two largest cigarette manufacturers  have historically  because of their dominant market share  been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry 
philip morris and rj reynolds dominate the domestic cigarette market and had a combined market share of approximately at december  this concentration of united states market share could make it more difficult for liggett and vector tobacco to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition in the market  either of which could have a material adverse effect on their sales volume  operating income and cash flows  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
liggett s business is highly dependent on the discount cigarette segment 
liggett depends more on sales in the discount cigarette segment of the market  relative to the full price premium segment  than its major competitors 
since  all of liggett s unit volume was generated in the discount segment 
the discount segment 
table of contents is highly competitive  with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price 
while the three major manufacturers all compete with liggett in the discount segment of the market  the strongest competition for market share has come from a group of smaller manufacturers and importers  most of which sell low quality  deep discount cigarettes 
while liggett s share of the discount market was in  in and in  management science associates data indicate that the discount market share of these other smaller manufacturers and importers was approximately in  in  and in if pricing in the discount market continues to be impacted by these smaller manufacturers and importers  margins in liggett s only current market segment could be negatively affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
liggett s market share is susceptible to decline 
for a number of years prior to  liggett suffered a substantial decline in market share 
liggett s market share declined in  after having increased during each of the years between and except for  which was unchanged 
this earlier market share erosion resulted in part from liggett s highly leveraged capital structure that existed until december and its limited ability to match other competitors wholesale and retail trade programs  obtain retail shelf space for its products and advertise its brands 
these declines also resulted from adverse developments in the tobacco industry  intense competition and changes in consumer preferences which have continued up to the current time 
according to management science associates data  liggett s overall domestic market share during was compared to during  and during liggett s share of the discount segment was during  during and during liggett market share declined by in  and if it were to decline substantially in the future  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
the domestic cigarette industry has experienced declining unit sales in recent periods 
industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states have been declining for a number of years  with management science associates data indicating that domestic industry wide shipments decreased by approximately in as compared to  and by approximately in as compared to we believe that industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states will continue to decline as a result of numerous factors 
these factors include health considerations  diminishing social acceptance of smoking  and a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limiting smoking in restaurants  bars and other public places  as well as increases in federal and state excise taxes and settlement related expenses which have contributed to high cigarette price levels in recent years 
if this decline in industry wide shipments continues and liggett is unable to capture market share from its competitors  or if the industry as a whole is unable to offset the decline in unit sales with price increases  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
our tobacco operations are subject to substantial and increasing legislation  regulation and taxation  which has a negative effect on revenue and profitability 
tobacco products are subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes in the united states 
these taxes may continue to increase 
on april   the federal excise tax increased from to per pack of cigarettes  and significant tax increases on other tobacco products  to fund expansion of the state children s health insurance program  referred to as schip 
the increases in federal excise tax under schip are substantial  and  as a result  liggett s sales volume and profitability has been and may continue to be adversely impacted 
in addition  schip created certain tax differentials between certain types of tobacco products 
this has caused a dramatic increase in the sale of pipe tobacco as a substitute for roll your own  which has directly impacted sales of cigarettes 
in addition to federal and state excise taxes  certain city and county governments also impose substantial excise taxes on tobacco products sold 
increased excise taxes are likely to result in declines in overall sales volume and shifts by consumers to less expensive brands 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limiting the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places 
private businesses also have adopted regulations that prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking 
such laws and regulations also are likely to result in a decline in the overall sales volume of cigarettes 
over the years  various state and local governments have continued to regulate tobacco products 
these regulations relate to  among other things  disclosure of ingredient information  the imposition of significantly higher taxes  increases in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products  sampling and advertising bans or restrictions  ingredient and constituent disclosure requirements and significant tobacco control media campaigns 
additional state and local legislative and regulatory actions will likely be considered in the future  including  among other things  restrictions on the use of flavorings 

table of contents in addition to the foregoing  there have been a number of other restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies  including the united states environmental protection agency and the food and drug administration fda 
there have also been adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
legislation was passed by congress providing for regulation of cigarettes by fda 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
additionally  a majority of states have passed legislation providing for reduced ignition propensity standards for cigarettes 
these developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry  possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation  and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation or legislation 
we are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation  but our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
additional federal or state regulation relating to the manufacture  sale  distribution  advertising  labeling  or information disclosure of tobacco products could further reduce sales  increase costs and have a material adverse effect on our business 
the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act may adversely affect our sales and operating profit 
on june   the president signed into law the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act public law 
the law grants fda broad authority over the manufacture  sale  marketing and packaging of tobacco products  although fda is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products  or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero 
among other measures  the law under various deadlines increases the number of health warnings required on cigarette and smokeless tobacco products  increases the size of warnings on packaging and in advertising  requires fda to develop graphic warnings for cigarette packages  and grants fda authority to require new warnings  requires practically all tobacco product advertising to eliminate color and imagery and instead consist solely of black text on white background  imposes new restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products  including significant new restrictions on tobacco product advertising and promotion  as well as the use of brand and trade names  bans the use of light  mild  low or similar descriptors on tobacco products  bans the use of characterizing flavors in cigarettes other than tobacco or menthol  gives fda the authority to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health by  for example  requiring reduction or elimination of the use of particular constituents or components  requiring product testing  or addressing other aspects of tobacco product construction  constituents  properties or labeling  requires manufacturers to obtain fda review and authorization for the marketing of certain new or modified tobacco products  requires pre market approval by fda for tobacco products represented through labels  labeling  advertising  or other means as presenting a lower risk of harm or tobacco related disease  requires manufacturers to report ingredients and harmful constituents and requires fda to disclose certain constituent information to the public  mandates that manufacturers test and report on ingredients and constituents identified by fda as requiring such testing to protect the public health  and allows fda to require the disclosure of testing results to the public  requires manufacturers to submit to fda certain information regarding the health  toxicological  behavioral or physiological effects of tobacco products  prohibits use of tobacco containing a pesticide chemical residue at a level greater than allowed under federal law  requires fda to establish good manufacturing practices to be followed at tobacco manufacturing facilities  requires tobacco product manufacturers and certain other entities to register with fda  authorizes fda to require the reduction of nicotine although it may not require the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero and the potential reduction or elimination of other constituents  including menthol  imposes and allows fda to impose various recordkeeping and reporting requirements on tobacco product manufacturers  grants fda the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions  and imposes user fees on tobacco product manufacturers 

table of contents it is likely that the new tobacco law could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states  including sales of liggett and vector tobacco brands 
total compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by fda under the new tobacco law 
costs  however  could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the companies financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it 
we are aware  for example  that fda has already requested company specific information from competitors 
fda has also initiated a program to award contracts to states to assist with compliance and enforcement activities 
failure to comply with the new tobacco law and with fda regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operation of both liggett and vector tobacco 
at present  we are not able to predict whether the new tobacco law will impact liggett and vector tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry  thus affecting its competitive position 
litigation will continue to harm the tobacco industry 
liggett could be subjected to substantial liabilities and bonding requirements from litigation relating to cigarette products 
adverse litigation outcomes could have a negative impact on our ability to operate due to their impact on cash flows 
we and our liggett subsidiary  as well as the entire cigarette industry  continue to be challenged on numerous fronts  particularly with respect to the engle progeny cases in florida described below 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
as of december   there were approximately  engle progeny cases  individual product liability lawsuits  four purported class actions and one health care cost recovery action pending in the united states in which liggett and or us were named defendants 
it is likely that similar legal actions  proceedings and claims will continue to be filed against liggett 
punitive damages  often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars  are specifically pled in certain cases  in addition to compensatory and other damages 
it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases including the certification of additional class actions 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liggett could face difficulties in obtaining a bond to stay execution of a judgment pending appeal 
in september  a civil lawsuit was filed by the united states federal government seeking disgorgement of approximately billion from various cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
in august  the trial court entered a final judgment and remedial order against each of the cigarette manufacturing defendants  except liggett 
the final judgment  among other things  ordered the following relief against the non liggett defendants i defendants are enjoined from committing any act of racketeering concerning the manufacturing  marketing  promotion  health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the united states  ii defendants are enjoined from making any material false  misleading  or deceptive statement or representation concerning cigarettes that persuades people to purchase cigarettes  and iii defendants are permanently enjoined from utilizing lights  low tar  ultra lights  mild or natural descriptors  or conveying any other express or implied health messages in connection with the marketing or sale of cigarettes as of january  no monetary damages were awarded other than the government s costs 
to the extent that the final judgment leads to a decline in industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states or otherwise imposes regulations which adversely affect the industry  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
liggett only cases 
there are currently eight cases pending where liggett is the only remaining tobacco company defendant 
cases where liggett is the only defendant could increase substantially as a result of the engle progeny cases 
as new product liability cases are commenced against liggett  the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase 
individual tobacco related cases have increased as a result of the florida supreme court s ruling in engle 
in may  a florida intermediate appellate court overturned a million punitive damages award against liggett and decertified the engle v 
r 
j 
reynolds tobacco co 
smoking and health class action 
in july  the florida supreme court affirmed in part and reversed in part the may intermediate appellate court decision 
among other things  the florida supreme court affirmed the decision decertifying the class on a prospective basis and the order vacating the punitive damages award  but preserved several of the trial court s phase i findings including that i smoking causes lung cancer  among other diseases  ii nicotine in cigarettes is addictive  iii defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous  iv the defendants concealed material information  v all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective  and vi all defendants were negligent and allowed plaintiffs to proceed to trial on individual liability issues using the above findings and compensatory and punitive damage issues  provided they commence their individual lawsuits within one year of the date the court s decision became final on january   the date of the court s mandate 
in december  the florida supreme court added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that  at the time of sale or supply  did not conform to the representations made by defendants 

table of contents in june  the jury in a florida state court action entitled lukacs v 
rj reynolds tobacco company  awarded million in compensatory damages  jointly and severally  in a case involving liggett and two other cigarette manufacturers  which amount was subsequently reduced by the court 
the jury found liggett responsible for the damages incurred by the plaintiff 
the lukacs case was the first case to be tried as an individual engle class member suit following entry of final judgment by the engle trial court 
in november  the court entered final judgment in the amount of million for which liggett was responsible  plus interest from june after the appellate court affirmed the decision  liggett paid its share of the award including interest and attorney s fees million 
pursuant to the florida supreme court s july ruling in engle  former class members had one year from january  to file individual lawsuits 
in addition  some individuals who filed suit prior to january   and who claim they meet the conditions in engle  are attempting to avail themselves of the engle ruling 
lawsuits by individuals requesting the benefit of the engle ruling  whether filed before or after the january  mandate  are referred to as the engle progeny cases 
as of december   there were  engle progeny cases pending where vector  liggett  and other cigarette manufacturers were named as defendants 
these cases include approximately  plaintiffs 
as of december   there were engle progeny cases currently scheduled for trial in through january   eight adverse verdicts have been entered against liggett in engle progeny cases 
two of these were affirmed on appeal and were satisfied by liggett 
the remaining verdicts are at various stages of appeal although appellate efforts  to date  have not been successful 
the potential range of loss is between and million  plus interest and attorney fees  for the six cases currently on appeal it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
we cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
excise tax increases adversely affect cigarette sales 
cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing federal  state and local excise taxes 
in february  federal legislation to reauthorize schip  which includes funding provisions that increase the federal cigarette excise tax from to per pack  was enacted  effective april  additional increases in the federal cigarette excise tax have been proposed by congress 
state excise taxes vary considerably and  when combined with sales taxes  local taxes and the federal excise tax  may exceed per pack 
various states and other jurisdictions are considering  or have pending  legislation proposing further state excise tax increases 
management believes increases in excise and similar taxes have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on sales of cigarettes 
liggett may have additional payment obligations under the master settlement agreement 
npm adjustment 
in march  an economic consulting firm selected pursuant to the msa determined that the msa was a significant factor contributing to the loss of market share of participating manufacturers for this is known as the npm adjustment 
the economic consulting firm subsequently rendered the same decision with respect to and in march  a different economic consulting firm made the same determination for as a result  the manufacturers are entitled to potential npm adjustments to their   and msa payments 
the participating manufacturers are also entitled to potential npm adjustments to their  and payments pursuant to an agreement entered into in june between the opms and the settling states under which the opms agreed to make certain payments for the benefit of the settling states  in exchange for which the settling states stipulated that the msa was a significant factor contributing to the loss of market share of participating manufacturers in  and a settling state that has diligently enforced its qualifying escrow statute in the year in question may be able to avoid application of the npm adjustment to the payments made by the manufacturers for the benefit of that state or territory 
for liggett and vector tobacco  as applicable  disputed that they owe the settling states the npm adjustments as calculated by the independent auditor 
as permitted by the msa  liggett and vector tobacco withheld payment associated with these npm adjustment amounts 
for  liggett and vector tobacco paid the npm adjustment amount of million to the settling states although both companies continue to dispute this amount is owed 
the total amount withheld or paid into a disputed payment account by liggett and vector tobacco for was million 
at december  included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet was a non current receivable of million relating to the million payment 
arbitration of the npm adjustment is pending 
liggett is currently engaged in an arbitration with the states over the npm adjustment 
the following amounts have not been expensed by the company as they relate to liggett and vector tobacco s npm adjustment claims for through million for  million for and  for 
table of contents gross v 
net calculations 
in october  the independent auditor notified liggett and all other participating manufacturers that their payment obligations under the msa  dating from the agreement s execution in late  had been recalculated using net units  rather than gross units which had been used since 
liggett objected to this retroactive change and disputed the change in methodology 
liggett contends that the retroactive change from gross to net units is impermissible for several reasons  including use of net units is not required by the msa as reflected by  among other things  the use of gross units through  such a change is not authorized without the consent of affected parties to the msa  the msa provides for four year time limitation periods for revisiting calculations and determinations  which precludes recalculating liggett s market share and thus  liggett s market share exemption  and liggett and others have relied upon the calculations based on gross units since the change in the method of calculation could have resulted in liggett owing as much as  of additional msa payments for prior years  including interest  because the proposed change from gross to net units would have lowered liggett s grandfathered market share exemption under the msa 
we estimated that liggett s future annual msa payments would have been at least approximately  higher if the method of calculation was changed 
in august  liggett received notice from several states seeking to initiate arbitration as to this matter 
in december  the parties arbitrated the dispute before a panel of three arbitrators 
on february   the arbitrators issued a decision granting the relief sought by liggett 
the arbitrators ruled that the limitations provisions of the msa precluded the independent auditor from recalculating liggett grandfathered market share exemption or liggett payment obligations beyond the last four years 
the arbitrators further ruled that  for purposes of calculating liggett payment obligations for the applicable years  liggett market share should be calculated on a net basis  increased by a factor of 
liggett is in the process of seeking reconsideration of the part of the arbitrators decision that would require the increase in liggett market share 
if the arbitrator ruling is not modified  liggett would be required to pay approximately  for the last four years and approximately  for we cannot quantify future annual obligations as a result of the ruling 
liggett accrued  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any potential liability relating to the gross v 
net dispute 
there can be no assurance that liggett will be successful in seeking modification of the award or that liggett will not be required to make additional payments  which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
liggett may have additional payment obligations under its state settlements 
in  the attorneys general for each of florida  mississippi and texas advised liggett that they believed that liggett had failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states for the period through and that additional payments may be due for and subsequent years 
liggett believes these allegations are without merit  based  among other things  on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements and no amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any additional amounts that may be payable by liggett under the settlement agreements with mississippi and texas 
liggett settled the dispute with florida in and agreed to  among other things  pay florida million plus  per year for the next years 
the payment in years will be subject to an inflation adjustment 
in february  mississippi provided liggett with a day notice that the state intended to pursue its remedies if liggett did not cure its alleged defaults 
liggett responded to mississippi letter but has heard nothing further on the matter 
there can be no assurance that liggett will prevail in the remaining matters and that liggett will not be required to make additional material payments  which payments could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and the value of our common stock 
new valley is subject to risks relating to the industries in which it operates 
risks of real estate ventures 
new valley has a number of real estate related investments in which other partners hold significant interests 
new valley must seek approval from these other parties for important actions regarding these joint ventures 
since the other parties interests may differ from those of new valley  a deadlock could arise that might impair the ability of the ventures to function 
such a deadlock could significantly harm the ventures 
the volatility in the capital and credit markets has increased in recent years 
because the volatility in capital and credit markets may create additional risks in the upcoming months and possibly years  we will continue to perform additional assessments to determine the impact  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
thus  future impairment charges may occur 
new valley may pursue a variety of real estate development projects 
development projects are subject to special risks including potential increase in costs  changes in market demand  inability to meet deadlines which may delay the timely completion of projects  reliance on contractors who may be unable to perform and the need to obtain various governmental and third party consents 

table of contents risks relating to the residential brokerage business 
through new valley s investment in douglas elliman realty  we are subject to the risks and uncertainties endemic to the residential brokerage business 
real estate ventures and mortgage receivables have been negatively impacted by the current downturn in the residential real estate market 
the us residential real estate market  including the new york metropolitan area where douglas elliman realty operates  is cyclical and is affected by changes in the general economic conditions that are beyond the control of douglas elliman realty 
the us residential real estate market is currently in a significant downturn due to various factors including downward pressure on housing prices  credit constraints inhibiting new buyers and an exceptionally large inventory of unsold homes at the same time that sales volumes are decreasing 
the depth and length of the current downturn in the real estate industry has proved exceedingly difficult to predict 
we cannot predict whether the downturn will worsen or when the market and related economic forces will return the us residential real estate industry to a growth period 
any of the following could have a material adverse effect on our real estate ventures by causing a general decline in the number of home sales and or prices  which in turn  could adversely affect their revenues and profitability periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  the general availability of mortgage financing  including the impact of the recent contraction in the subprime and mortgage markets generally  and the effect of more stringent lending standards for home mortgages  adverse changes in economic and general business conditions in the new york metropolitan area  a decrease in the affordability of homes  declining demand for real estate  a negative perception of the market for residential real estate  commission pressure from brokers who discount their commissions  acts of god  such as hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters  or acts or threats of war or terrorism  and or an increase in the cost of homeowners insurance 
termination of franchise agreement 
douglas elliman realty is in discussions with prudential related to certain matters in connection with the franchise agreements  and douglas elliman realty has elected to cease operating as a prudential franchisee 
douglas elliman realty is seeking a resolution of these matters 
the stated initial expiration date of the franchise agreements is march  unless douglas elliman realty chooses to renew the franchise agreements prior to march  as a result of the termination or expiration of the franchise agreements  in accordance with the terms of the limited liability company operating agreement  douglas elliman realty is required to redeem the approximate equity interest owned by a former affiliate of prudential 
the redemption price for such equity interest is to be determined through an appraisal process in accordance with the terms of douglas elliman realty limited liability company operating agreement 
douglas elliman realty expects to resolve this matter in the three major real estate ventures current operations are located in the new york metropolitan area 
local and regional economic and general business conditions in this market could differ materially from prevailing conditions in other parts of the country 
a downturn in the residential real estate market or economic conditions in that region could have a material adverse effect on these investments 
potential new investments we may make are unidentified and may not succeed 
we currently hold a significant amount of marketable securities and cash not committed to any specific investments 
this subjects a security holder to increased risk and uncertainty because a security holder will not be able to evaluate how this cash will be invested and the economic merits of particular investments 
there may be substantial delay in locating suitable investment opportunities 
in addition  we may lack relevant management experience in the areas in which we may invest 
there is a risk that we will fail in targeting  consummating or effectively integrating or managing any of these investments 
we depend on our key personnel 
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal control over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to assess  and our independent registered certified public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
we completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended december   and we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to continue to comply with these requirements 
we expect to continue to incur expense and to devote management resources to section compliance 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered certified public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions and our reputation may be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 
the trading price of our common stock has ranged between and per share over the past weeks 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  the operating and stock performance of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  the initiation or outcome of litigation  changes in interest rates  general economic  market and political conditions  additions or departures of key personnel  and future sales of our equity or convertible securities 
we cannot predict the extent  if any  to which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  may depress the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
furthermore  stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly  which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management 
these factors  among others  could significantly depress the price of our common stock 
we have many potentially dilutive securities outstanding 
at december   we had outstanding options granted to employees  including restricted shares  to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  of which options for  shares were exercisable at december  we also have outstanding convertible notes and debentures maturing in november and june  which are currently convertible into  shares of our common stock 
the issuance of these shares will cause dilution which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview we are a holding company and are engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the united states through our liggett group llc and vector tobacco inc subsidiaries  and the real estate business through our new valley llc subsidiary  which is seeking to acquire additional operating companies and real estate properties 
new valley owns of douglas elliman realty  llc  which operates the largest residential brokerage company in the new york metropolitan area 
all of our tobacco operations unit sales volume in  and was in the discount segment  which management believes has been the primary growth segment in the industry for over a decade 
the significant discounting of premium cigarettes in recent years has led to brands  such as eve  that were traditionally considered premium brands to become more appropriately categorized as discount  following list price reductions 
our tobacco subsidiaries cigarettes are produced in approximately combinations of length  style and packaging 
liggett s current brand portfolio includes pyramid the industry s first deep discount product with a brand identity re launched in the second quarter of  and grand prix re launched as a national brand in  liggett select a leading brand in the deep discount category  eve a leading brand of millimeter cigarettes in the branded discount category  and usa and various partner brands and private label brands 
in  liggett introduced liggett select  one of the leading brands in the deep discount category 
liggett select represented in  in and in of liggett unit volume 
in september  liggett repositioned grand prix to distributors and retailers nationwide 
grand prix represented in  in and in of liggett unit volume 
in april  liggett repositioned pyramid as a box only brand with a new low price to specifically compete with brands which are priced at the lowest level of the deep discount segment 
pyramid is now the largest seller in liggett s family of brands with of liggett s unit volume in  in and in according to management science associates  liggett held a share of approximately of the overall discount market segment for compared to for and for under the master settlement agreement msa reached in november with states and various territories  the three largest cigarette manufacturers must make settlement payments to the states and territories based on how many cigarettes they sell annually 
liggett  however  is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us cigarette market 
additionally  vector tobacco has no payment obligation unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us market 
liggett s and vector tobacco s payments under the msa are based on each company s incremental market share above the minimum threshold applicable to such company 
we believe that our tobacco subsidiaries have gained a sustainable cost advantage over their competitors as a result of the settlement 
the discount segment is a challenging marketplace  with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price 
liggett s competition is now divided into two segments 
the first segment is made up of the three largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the united states  philip morris usa inc  rj reynolds tobacco company  and lorillard tobacco company 
the three largest manufacturers  while primarily premium cigarette based companies  also produce and sell discount cigarettes 
the second segment of competition is comprised of a group of smaller manufacturers and importers  most of which sell deep discount cigarettes 
our largest competitor in this segment is commonwealth brands  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of imperial tobacco plc

variable interest senior convertible senior notes due in november  we sold  of our variable interest senior convertible notes due the convertible notes in a public offering registered under the securities act 
the convertible notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the convertible notes are also structurally subordinated to all liabilities and commitments of our subsidiaries 
the aggregate net proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes were approximately  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions  fees and offering expenses 
the convertible notes pay interest total interest on a quarterly basis beginning january  at a rate of per annum plus additional interest  which is based on the amount of cash dividends paid during the prior three month period ending on the record date for such interest payment multiplied by the total number of shares of its common stock into which the debt will be convertible on such record date 
notwithstanding the foregoing  however  the interest payable on each interest payment date shall be the higher of i the total interest and ii per annum 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at the holder s option 
the conversion price at december  was per share approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of the note  is subject to adjustment for various events  including the issuance of stock dividends 
the notes will mature on january  share lending agreement 
in connection with the offering of our convertible notes  we entered into a share lending agreement with jefferies company  the underwriter for the offering  under which we lent jefferies company  shares of our common stock to facilitate hedging transactions related to the convertible notes 
jefferies company has since returned  of the borrowed shares and  shares remain outstanding at december  subject to certain limitations  jefferies company may from time to time during the term of the share lending agreement borrow up to  additional shares of our common stock from us for certain additional offerings 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares  other than a nominal loan fee from jefferies company equal to per share lent to jefferies company 

table of contents the share lending agreement requires that the shares borrowed be returned upon the maturity of the related debt  january  or earlier  including the redemption of the convertible notes or the conversion of the notes to shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the notes 
borrowed shares are issued and outstanding for corporate law purposes and  accordingly  the holders of the borrowed shares will have all of the rights of a holder of our outstanding shares 
however  because the share borrower must return to us all borrowed shares or identical shares  the borrowed shares are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing and reporting our earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
jefferies agreed to pay to us an amount equal to any dividends or other distributions that we pay on the borrowed shares 
we determined the fair value of the share lending agreement was  at the date of issuance based on the value of the presence of the share lending agreement related to the terms of the offering 
the  fair value was recognized as a debt financing charge and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes 
as of december    shares were outstanding on the share lending agreement and had been amortized to interest expense

new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
liggett could be subjected to substantial liabilities and bonding requirements from litigation relating to cigarette products 
adverse litigation outcomes could have a negative impact on our ability to operate due to their impact on cash flows 
we and our liggett subsidiary  as well as the entire cigarette industry  continue to be challenged on numerous fronts  particularly with respect to the engle progeny cases in florida 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
it is likely that similar legal actions  proceedings and claims will continue to be filed against liggett 
punitive damages  often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars  are specifically pled in certain cases  in addition to compensatory and other damages 
it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases including the certification of additional class actions 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liggett could face difficulties in obtaining a bond to stay execution of a judgment pending appeal 
as of december   there were approximately  engle progeny cases  individual product liability lawsuits  four purported class actions and one healthcare cost recovery action pending in the united states in which liggett or us  or both  were named as a defendant 
to date  adverse verdicts have been entered against liggett in eight engle progeny cases 
engle progeny cases 
in  a jury in engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co 
rendered a  punitive damages verdict in favor of a florida class against certain cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
pursuant to the florida supreme court july ruling in engle  which decertified the class on a prospective basis  and affirmed the appellate court reversal of the punitive damages award  former class members had one year from january  in which to file individual lawsuits 
in addition  some individuals who filed suit prior to january   and who claim they meet the conditions in engle  are attempting to avail themselves of the engle ruling 
lawsuits by individuals requesting the benefit of the engle ruling  whether filed before or after the january  deadline  are referred to as the engle progeny cases 
liggett and us are currently named in  engle progeny cases in both federal  cases and state  cases courts in florida 
other cigarette manufacturers have also been named as defendants in these cases  although as a case proceeds  one or more defendants may ultimately be dismissed from the action 
these cases include approximately  plaintiffs 

table of contents liggett only cases 
there are currently eight cases pending where liggett is the only remaining tobacco company defendant 
these cases consist of four individual actions and four engle progeny cases 
cases where liggett is the only defendant could increase substantially as a result of the engle progeny cases 
in february  in ferlanti v 
liggett group  a florida state court jury awarded compensatory damages to plaintiff and an judgment was entered by the court 
that judgment was affirmed on appeal and was satisfied by liggett in march in september  the court awarded plaintiff legal fees of liggett paid legal fees and accrued interest of  in january liggett previously accrued  for the ferlanti case 
critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates subject to material changes in the near term include impairment charges  inventory valuation  deferred tax assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  promotional accruals  sales returns and allowances  actuarial assumptions of pension plans  the estimated fair value of embedded derivative liabilities  settlement accruals  long term investments and impairments  accounting for investments in equity securities  and litigation and defense costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of cigarettes are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sale price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide an allowance for expected sales returns  net of any related inventory cost recoveries 
in accordance with authoritative guidance on how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  our accounting policy is to include federal excise taxes in revenues and cost of goods sold 
such revenues and cost of sales totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since our primary line of business is tobacco  our financial position and our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by significant unit sales volume declines  litigation and defense costs  increased tobacco costs or reductions in the selling price of cigarettes in the near term 
marketing costs 
we record marketing costs as an expense in the period to which such costs relate 
we do not defer the recognition of any amounts on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to marketing costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred  which is the period in which the related advertisement initially appears 
we record consumer incentive and trade promotion costs as a reduction in revenue in the period in which these programs are offered  based on estimates of utilization and redemption rates that are developed from historical information 
contingencies 
we record liggett product liability legal expenses and other litigation costs as operating  selling  administrative and general expenses as those costs are incurred 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings regarding liggett tobacco products are pending or threatened in various jurisdictions against liggett and us 
we record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
at the present time  while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur  except as disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements and discussed below related to the eight cases where an adverse verdict was entered against liggett i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco related cases  or ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobacco related cases and  therefore  management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 
although liggett has generally been successful in managing litigation in the past  litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain  particularly with respect to the engle progeny cases 
adverse verdicts have been entered against liggett in eight state court engle progeny cases exclusive of the lukacs case  discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  and two of these verdicts have been affirmed on appeal 
at december   liggett and us are defendants in  state court engle progeny cases 
through december   other than the lukacs case  the verdicts against liggett have ranged from to  in two of these cases  punitive damages were also awarded for  and  we have not accrued for these cases as of december  our potential range of loss in the six engle progeny cases currently on appeal is between and  in the aggregate  plus accrued interest and attorneys fees 
in determining the range of loss  we consider potential settlements as well as future appellate relief 
except as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss from remaining engle progeny cases as there are currently multiple defendants in each case and discovery has 
table of contents not occurred or is limited 
as a result  we lack information about whether plaintiffs are  in fact  engle class members non class members claims are generally time barred  the relevant smoking history  the nature of the alleged injury and the availability of various defenses  among other things 
further  plaintiffs typically do not specify their demand for damages 
there is other tobacco related litigation pending against liggett  which is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this litigation is also evaluated on a quarterly basis 
management is not able to predict the outcome of any of the other tobacco related litigation pending or threatened against liggett 
you should not infer from the absence of any reserve in our consolidated financial statements that we will not be subject to significant tobacco related liabilities in the future 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation 
settlement agreements 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  liggett and vector tobacco are participants in the msa 
liggett and vector tobacco have no payment obligations under the msa except to the extent their market shares exceed approximately and  respectively  of total cigarettes sold in the united states 
their obligations  and the related expense charges under the msa  are subject to adjustments based upon  among other things  the volume of cigarettes sold by liggett and vector tobacco  their relative market shares and inflation 
since relative market shares are based on cigarette shipments  the best estimate of the allocation of charges under the msa is recorded in cost of goods sold as the products are shipped 
settlement expenses under the msa recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were  for   for and  for adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
embedded derivatives and beneficial conversion feature 
we measure all derivatives  including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts  at fair value and recognize them in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset or a liability  depending on our rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
we have issued variable interest senior convertible debt in a series of private placements where a portion of the total interest payable on the debt is computed by reference to the cash dividends paid on our common stock 
this portion of the interest payment is considered an embedded derivative within the convertible debt  which we are required to separately value 
as a result  we have bifurcated this embedded derivative and estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative liability 
the resulting discount created by allocating a portion of the issuance proceeds to the embedded derivative is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest method 
at december  and  the fair value of derivative liabilities was estimated at  and  respectively 
the increase is due to the loss on the changes in fair value of convertible debt and the addition of the convertible notes 
changes to the fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations as changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
the value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt 
we recognized a loss of  in  a gain of  in and a gain of  in due to changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives 
after giving effect to the recording of embedded derivative liabilities as a discount to the convertible debt  our common stock had a fair value at the issuance date of the notes in excess of the conversion price  resulting in a beneficial conversion feature 
the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature was recorded as additional paid in capital and as a further discount on the debt 
the discount is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest rate method 
we recognized non cash interest expense of   and  in  and  respectively  due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the embedded derivatives and   and  in  and  respectively  due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature 
inventories 
tobacco inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined primarily by the last in  first out lifo method at liggett and vector tobacco 
although portions of leaf tobacco inventories may not be used or sold within one year because of time required for aging  they are included in current assets  which is common practice in the industry 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
stock based compensation 
our stock based compensation uses a fair value based method to recognize non cash compensation expense for share based transactions 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of   and  in  and related to the amortization of stock option awards and   and  related to the amortization of restricted stock grants 
as of december  and  there was  and  respectively  of total unrecognized cost related to employee stock options and and  respectively  of total unrecognized cost related to restricted stock grants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents employee benefit plans 
the determination of our net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
we determine discount rates by using a quantitative analysis that considers the prevailing prices of investment grade bonds and the anticipated cash flow from our two qualified defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical and life insurance plans 
these analyses construct a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the annual projected cash flows from our pension and retiree health plans 
as of december   our benefit obligations were computed assuming a discount rate between 
as of december   our service cost was computed assuming a discount rate of 
in determining our expected rate of return on plan assets we consider input from our external advisors and historical returns based on the expected long term rate of return is the weighted average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset class 
our actual year annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and our actual five year annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in computing expense for the year ended december   we will use an assumption of a annual rate of return on our pension plan assets 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized income or expense in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our future net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense 
net pension expense for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit expense was   and  for  and  respectively  and we currently anticipate such expense will be approximately  for in contrast  our funding obligations under the pension plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
to comply with erisa s minimum funding requirements  we do not currently anticipate that we will be required to make any funding to the tax qualified pension plans for the pension plan year beginning on january  and ending on december  long term investments and impairments 
at december   we had long term investments of  which consisted primarily of investment partnerships investing in investment securities and real estate 
the investments in these investment partnerships are illiquid and the ultimate realization of these investments is subject to the performance of the underlying partnership and its management by the general partners 
the estimated fair value of the investment partnerships is provided by the partnerships based on the indicated market values of the underlying assets or investment portfolio 
gains are recognized when realized in our consolidated statement of operations 
losses are recognized as realized or upon the determination of the occurrence of an other than temporary decline in fair value 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our investments to determine whether an impairment has occurred 
if so  we also make a determination of whether such impairment is considered temporary or other than temporary 
we believe that the assessment of temporary or other than temporary impairment is facts and circumstances driven 
however  among the matters that are considered in making such a determination are the period of time the investment has remained below its cost or carrying value  the severity of the decline  the likelihood of recovery given the reason for the decrease in market value and our original expected holding period of the investment 
income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time and  as a result  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments may materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accounting for income taxes and uncertain tax positions 
results of operations the following discussion provides an assessment of our results of operations  capital resources and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

liggett s ebitda  as defined  were approximately  for the twelve months ended december  we and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations 
at december   we and our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness of  approximately  of our convertible notes mature in we were required to mandatorily redeem on june  of the total aggregate principal amount outstanding  or  of the company variable interest senior convertible debentures due other than the holders of principal amount of the debentures  who had of their aggregate principal amount of debentures mandatorily redeemed  each holder of the notes chose to convert its pro rata portion of the  of principal into our common stock 
we recorded accelerated interest expense of  for the year ended december   on the conversion of the  of debentures into  shares of common stock 
the debt conversion resulted in a non cash financing transaction of  we were required to offer to purchase the remaining  of the debentures on june  none of the debentures were surrendered for repurchase by us 
holders of the debentures converted an aggregate of  principal amount of the debentures into  shares of the company common stock in we recorded non cash accelerated interest expense related to the converted debt of  for the year ended december  the debt conversion resulted in a reclassification from debt to equity in the amount of  as of

there is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt 
if we cannot service our fixed charges  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we believe that our cigarette operations are positive cash flow generating units and will continue to be able to sustain our operations without any significant liquidity concerns 
in order to meet the above liquidity requirements as well as other anticipated liquidity needs in the normal course of business  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  investment securities available for sale of approximately  long term investments with an estimated value of approximately  and availability under liggett credit facility of approximately  at december  management currently anticipates that these amounts  as well as expected cash flows from our operations  proceeds from public and or private debt and equity financing  management fees and other payments from subsidiaries should be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs over the next months 
we may acquire or seek to acquire additional operating businesses through merger  purchase of assets  stock acquisition or other means  or to make other investments  which may limit our liquidity otherwise available 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our investments to determine whether an impairment has occurred 
if so  we also make a determination if such impairment is considered temporary or other than temporary 
we believe that the assessment of temporary or other than temporary impairment is facts and circumstances driven 
however  among the matters that are considered in making such a determination are the period of time the investment has remained below its cost or carrying value  the likelihood of recovery given the reason for the decrease in market value and our original expected holding period of the investment 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was  at january  and decreased during the year ended december

off balance sheet arrangements we have various agreements in which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights 
payment by us under such indemnification clauses is generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and or amount  and in some instances  we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not been material 
as of december   we were not aware of any indemnification agreements that would or are reasonably expected to have a current or future material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

the letters of credit have been issued as security deposits for leases of office space  to secure the performance of our subsidiaries under various insurance programs and to provide collateral for various subsidiary borrowing and capital lease arrangements 
market risk we are exposed to market risks principally from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through our regular operating and financing activities and our long term investment strategy 
our market risk management procedures cover all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as of december   approximately  of our outstanding debt at face value had variable interest rates determined by various interest rate indices  which increases the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our variable rate borrowings  which could adversely affect our cash flows 
as of december  
table of contents  we had no interest rate caps or swaps 
based on a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by approximately in addition  as of december     principal amount of outstanding debt had a variable interest rate determined by the amount of the dividends on our common stock 
the difference between the stated value of the debt and carrying value is due principally to certain embedded derivatives  which were separately valued and recorded upon issuance 
changes to the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected within our statements of operations as changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
the value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt and changes in the closing stock price at the end of each quarterly period 
based on a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  our annual changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt could increase or decrease by approximately  with approximately resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our note due  resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our exchange notes due   resulting from the embedded derivative associated with the variable interest senior convertible notes  and the remaining  resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our variable interest senior convertible debentures due an increase in our quarterly dividend rate by per share would increase interest expense by approximately  per year 
we have estimated the fair market value of the embedded derivatives based principally on the results of a valuation model 
the value of the embedded derivatives is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt  our stock price as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt 
the interest rate component of the value of the embedded derivative is computed by calculating an equivalent non convertible  unsecured and subordinated borrowing cost

legislation and regulation reports with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years and  in the opinion of liggett s management  have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on cigarette sales 
since  the surgeon general of the united states and the secretary of health and human services have released a number of reports which state that cigarette smoking is a causative factor with respect to a variety of health hazards  including cancer  heart disease and lung disease  and have recommended various government actions to reduce the incidence of smoking 
in  liggett publicly acknowledged that  as the surgeon general and respected medical researchers have found  smoking causes health problems  including lung cancer  heart and vascular disease  and emphysema 
on june   the president signed into law the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act public law the tobacco control act 
the law grants the food and drug administration fda broad authority over the manufacture  sale  marketing and packaging of tobacco products  although fda is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products  or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero 
among other measures  the law under various deadlines increases the number of health warnings required on cigarette and smokeless tobacco products  increases the size of warnings on packaging and in advertising  requires fda to develop graphic warnings for cigarette packages  and grants fda authority to require new warnings  
table of contents requires practically all tobacco product advertising to eliminate color and imagery and instead consist solely of black text on white background  imposes new restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products  including significant new restrictions on tobacco product advertising and promotion  as well as the use of brand and trade names  bans the use of light  mild  low or similar descriptors on tobacco products  bans the use of characterizing flavors in cigarettes other than tobacco or menthol  gives fda the authority to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health by  for example  requiring reduction or elimination of the use of particular constituents or components  requiring product testing  or addressing other aspects of tobacco product construction  constituents  properties or labeling  requires manufacturers to obtain fda review and authorization for the marketing of certain new or modified tobacco products  requires pre market approval by fda for tobacco products represented through labels  labeling  advertising  or other means as presenting a lower risk of harm or tobacco related disease  requires manufacturers to report ingredients and harmful constituents and requires fda to disclose certain constituent information to the public  mandates that manufacturers test and report on ingredients and constituents identified by fda as requiring such testing to protect the public health  and allows fda to require the disclosure of testing results to the public  requires manufacturers to submit to fda certain information regarding the health  toxicological  behavioral or physiological effects of tobacco products  prohibits use of tobacco containing a pesticide chemical residue at a level greater than allowed under federal law  requires fda to establish good manufacturing practices to be followed at tobacco manufacturing facilities  requires tobacco product manufacturers and certain other entities to register with fda  authorizes fda to require the reduction of nicotine although it may not require the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero and the potential reduction or elimination of other constituents  including menthol  imposes and allows fda to impose various recordkeeping and reporting requirements on tobacco product manufacturers  and grants fda the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions 
the law also required establishment  within fda s new center for tobacco products  of a tobacco products scientific advisory committee tpsac to provide advice  information and recommendations with respect to the safety  dependence or health issues related to tobacco products  including a recommendation on modified risk applications  a recommendation on the effects of tobacco product nicotine yield alteration and whether there is a threshold level below which nicotine yields do not produce dependence  a report on the public health impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes  and a report on the public health impact of dissolvable tobacco products 
tpsac completed its review of the use of menthol in cigarettes and issued a report with recommendations to fda in march the report states that removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the united states  but does not expressly recommend that fda ban menthol cigarettes 
fda is considering the report and recommendations of tpsac and will make a determination about what future regulatory action s  if any  it believes are warranted 
a decision by fda to ban menthol in tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on us 
the law imposes user fees on certain tobacco product manufacturers in order to fund tobacco related fda activities 
user fees will be allocated among tobacco product classes according to a formula set out in the legislation  and then among manufacturers and importers within each class based on market share 
fda user fees for liggett and vector tobacco for were  and we estimate that they will be significantly higher in the future 
the law also imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products 
for example  as required under the law  fda has finalized certain portions of regulations previously adopted by fda in which were struck down by the supreme court in as beyond fda authority 
subject to limitations imposed by a federal injunction discussed 
table of contents below  these regulations took effect on june  as written  these regulations significantly limit the ability of manufacturers  distributors and retailers to advertise and promote tobacco products  by  for example  restricting the use of color and graphics in advertising  limiting the use of outdoor advertising  restricting the sale and distribution of non tobacco items and services  gifts  and sponsorship of events  and imposing restrictions on the use for cigarette or smokeless tobacco products of trade or brand names that are used for nontobacco products 
in august  several cigarette manufacturers filed a federal lawsuit against fda challenging the constitutionality of a number of the restrictions imposed by the tobacco control act  including the ban on color and graphics in advertising  the color graphic and non graphic warning label requirement  limits on the right to make truthful statements regarding modified risk tobacco products  restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising  and a ban on the distribution of product samples 
in january  a federal judge in kentucky ruled that the regulations ban on the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising was unconstitutional and prohibited fda from enforcing that ban 
the judge  however  let stand numerous other advertising and promotion restrictions 
in march  both parties appealed this decision 
in may  fda issued a guidance document indicating that it intends to exercise its enforcement discretion and not commence enforcement actions based upon these provisions during the pendency of the litigation 
in march  a federal appellate court reviewing the district court decision also let stand numerous advertising and promotion restrictions  but held that the ban on the use of color and graphics in advertising was unconstitutional 
in may  the federal appellate court denied the cigarette manufactures petition for rehearing en banc 
in october  the cigarette manufacturers filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking further review of the appellate court march decision 
we cannot predict the future course or outcome of this lawsuit 
in april  a number of cigarette manufacturers filed a federal lawsuit against fda challenging the restrictions on trade or brand names based upon first amendment and other grounds 
in may  fda issued a guidance document indicating that fda was aware of concerns regarding the trade and brand name restrictions and is considering what changes  if any  would be appropriate to address those concerns 
fda also indicated that while the agency was considering those issues  it intended to exercise its enforcement discretion and not commence trade or brand name enforcement actions for the duration of its consideration where the trade or brand name of the cigarettes or smokeless tobacco product was registered  or the product was marketed  in the united states on or before june   or the first marketing or registration in the united states of the tobacco product occurs before the first marketing or registration in the united states of the non tobacco product bearing the same name  provided  however  that the tobacco and non tobacco product are not owned  manufactured  or distributed by the same  related  or affiliated entities including as a licensee 
the lawsuit was subsequently stayed  at the request of the parties  pending fda evaluation of these concerns 
in november  fda issued a proposal to amend its trade name restrictions 
the proposal remains under consideration by the fda 
we cannot predict the future course of this proposed amendment or its potential impact on the litigation 
on june   fda issued a final rule that would modify the required warnings that appear on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements 
the rule was to become effective on september   and would have required each cigarette package and advertisement to bear one of nine new textual warning statements accompanied by graphic images 
the warnings would appear on at least the top of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and occupy at least of cigarette advertisements 
in august  a number of cigarette manufacturers  including liggett  filed a federal lawsuit against fda challenging the constitutionality of these new graphic images on first amendment and other grounds 
the manufacturers sought a preliminary injunction staying implementation of the graphic images  and other related labeling requirements  pending the court ruling on the merits of the challenge 
in november  a federal judge in the district of columbia granted the industry motion for a preliminary injunction  enjoining implementation of the rules for graphic images on cigarette packaging and advertising until months after the court issued a final ruling in the case 
fda appealed the ruling  and on february   the court granted the industry motion for summary judgment permanently enjoining implementation of fda graphic warnings regulation on first amendment grounds 
should fda ultimately issue new graphic warnings that are deemed constitutionally valid  the decision provides that such warnings would go into effect months after they are issued 
fda also appealed this ruling 
both fda appeals were consolidated and on august   the dc circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court and vacated the graphic warning requirements 
fda filed a petition asking that the case be reheard en banc 
the petition was denied 
the time has not yet expired for fda to petition the us supreme court to review the case 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation or whether or how the inclusion of the new warnings  if ultimately required by fda in new rulemaking  will impact product sales or whether it will have a material adverse effect on us 
the tobacco control act requires premarket review of new tobacco products 
a new tobacco product is one that was not commercially marketed in the us before february  or that was modified after that date 
in general  before a company may commercially market a new tobacco product  it must either a submit an application and obtain an order from fda permitting the product to be marketed  or b submit a report and receive an fda order finding the product to be substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product that was commercially marketed in the us prior to february  a substantially equivalent tobacco product is one that has the same characteristics as the predicate or one that has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health 

table of contents manufacturers of products first introduced after february  and before march  who submitted a substantial equivalence report to fda prior to march  may continue to market the tobacco product unless fda issues an order that the product is not substantially equivalent 
failure to submit the report before march   or fda conclusion that such a new tobacco product is not substantially equivalent  will cause the product to be deemed misbranded and or adulterated 
after march   a new tobacco product may not be marketed without an fda substantial equivalence determination 
prior to the deadline  liggett and vector tobacco submitted substantial equivalence reports to fda for numerous products 
it is possible that fda could determine some  or all  of these products are not substantially equivalent to a preexisting tobacco product 
such a determination could prevent us from marketing these products in the united states and could have a material adverse effect on us 
on july   fda issued a final rule to establish the process and criteria for requesting an exemption from substantial equivalence requirements 
we cannot predict how fda will interpret and apply these requirements  or whether fda will deem our products to be substantially equivalent to already marketed tobacco products 
separately  the law also requires fda to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold through non face to face transactions 
fda has been acting to implement the law and will continue to implement various provisions over time 
liggett and vector tobacco have been monitoring fda tobacco initiatives and have made various regulatory submissions to fda in order to comply with new requirements 
it is likely that the new tobacco law could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states  including sales of liggett and vector tobacco brands 
total compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by fda under the new tobacco law 
costs  however  could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the companies financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it 
we are aware  for example  that fda has already requested company specific information from competitors 
fda has also initiated a program to award contracts to states to assist with compliance and enforcement activities 
failure to comply with the new tobacco law and with fda regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operation of both liggett and vector tobacco 
at present  we are not able to predict whether the new tobacco law will impact liggett and vector tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry  thus affecting its competitive position 
in october  the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of fetra was signed into law 
fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders 
pursuant to the legislation  manufacturers of tobacco products have been assessed  over a ten year period  commencing in  to compensate tobacco growers and quota holders for the elimination of their quota rights 
for  cigarette manufacturers were responsible for approximately of the assessment based on relative unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments 
liggett s and vector tobacco s assessment was  for cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing federal  state and local excise taxes 
on april   the federal cigarette excise tax increased from to per pack 
state excise taxes vary considerably and  when combined with sales taxes  local taxes and the federal excise tax  may exceed per pack 
many states are considering  or have pending  legislation proposing further state excise tax increases 
management believes increases in excise and similar taxes have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on sales of cigarettes 
over the last several years all states and the district of columbia have enacted virtually identical legislation requiring cigarettes to meet a laboratory test standard for reduced ignition propensity 
cigarettes that meet this standard are referred to as fire standards compliant or fsc  and are sometimes commonly called self extinguishing 
all of the cigarettes that liggett and vector tobacco manufacture are fire standards compliant 
compliance with such legislation could be burdensome and costly and could harm the business of liggett and vector tobacco  particularly if there were to be varying standards from state to state 
in november  the federal trade commission ftc rescinded guidance it issued in that generally permitted statements concerning cigarette tar and nicotine yields if they were based on the cambridge filter method  sometimes called ftc method 
in its rescission notice  ftc also indicated that advertisers should no longer use terms suggesting ftc endorsement or approval of any specific test method  including terms such as per ftc method or other phrases that state or imply ftc endorsement or approval of the cambridge filter method or other machine based methods for measuring cigarette tar or nicotine yields 
also in its rescission notice  ftc indicated that cigarette descriptors such as light and ultra light have not been defined by ftc  nor has ftc provided any guidance or authorization for their use 
ftc indicated that to the extent descriptors are used in a manner that convey an overall impression that is false  misleading  or unsubstantiated  such use could be actionable 
ftc further indicated that companies must ensure that any continued use of descriptors does not convey an erroneous or unsubstantiated message that a particular cigarette presents a reduced risk of harm or is otherwise likely to mislead consumers 
in response to ftc action  we have removed all reference to tar and nicotine testing from our point of sale advertising 
in addition  the new tobacco law imposes a ban which took effect in june on the use of light  mild  low or similar descriptors on tobacco 
table of contents product labels and in labeling or advertising 
to the extent descriptors are no longer used to market or promote our cigarettes  this may have a material adverse effect on us 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limiting the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places  and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace 
there are various other legislative efforts pending at the federal  state or local level which seek to  among other things  eliminate smoking in public places  curtail affirmative defenses of tobacco companies in product liability litigation  and further restrict the sale  marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products 
this trend has had  and is likely to continue to have  an adverse effect on us 
it is not possible to predict what  if any  additional legislation  regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented  or to predict what the impact of the new fda tobacco law will be on these pending legislative efforts 
in addition to the foregoing  there have been a number of other restrictive regulatory actions  adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
these developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry  possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation  and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation or legislation
