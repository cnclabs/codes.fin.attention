see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion

gross profit included slightly higher merchandise margin of percentage points compared to the prior year 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to lower merchandise margin of percentage points primarily resulting from significantly increased product costs and promotional activity compared to the prior year

this was partially offset by a percentage point decrease in incentive and stock based compensation expense 
income taxes the effective tax rate was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in the effective tax during fiscal was due primarily from the lower overall profitability in fiscal and mix of canadian losses and us taxable income  as well as favorable tax accrual adjustments in fiscal see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements

cash flows from operating activities decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in net income of million  and was partially offset by the cash flow timing of operating assets and liabilities

loans under the credit facility are secured by all our assets and are guaranteed by the guarantors 
upon the occurrence of a cash dominion event as defined in the credit facility and includes either any event of default or failure to maintain availability in an amount greater than of the lesser of the borrowing base and facility commitment  our ability to borrow funds  make investments  pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock would be limited  among other limitations

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of february  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations real estate operating leases equipment operating leases employment agreements total contractual obligations the real estate operating leases included in the above table do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which amounted to approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal in addition  the above table does not include variable costs paid to landlords such as maintenance  insurance and taxes  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal we have an employment agreement with thomas p 
johnson  our chief executive officer  which is reflected in the above table 
additionally  we have a one year advisory contract with mr 
cunningham  which commenced in march the total contractual commitment for the agreement is million and is not included in the above table 
as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have a serp liability of million and other retirement plan liabilities of million at february  such liability amounts are not reflected in the table above 
we expect to make a payment in the next months of approximately million from our serp which is included in the total serp liability of million 
our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were million at february  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amount and timing of related future payments for these non current liabilities of million 
therefore these liabilities were not included in the above table 

table of contents in august  we entered into a new three year sourcing agreement with one of our sourcing agents 
the sourcing agreement may be terminated at any time during the term by mutual agreement of the parties and provided that appropriate notice is given in accordance with the agreement 
in connection with the sourcing agreement  we have a guaranteed minimum product purchase commitment of million that is measured over any consecutive two year period during the term of the agreement 
if we purchase less than this amount over the two year measurement period  then we will be obligated to pay the contracted commission on the shortfall from the guaranteed minimum 
as of february   we had met the first two year minimum product purchase commitment 
in addition  if we were to cancel purchase orders with this sourcing agent  we may have to reimburse the agent for costs and expenses  if any  that it had incurred 
all other open purchase orders are cancellable without penalty and are therefore not included in the above table 
we have not issued any other third party guarantees or commercial commitments as of february  in june  bank of america  na issued a stand by letter of credit 
as of february   the outstanding letter of credit was million and expires on june  we do not have any other stand by or commercial letters of credit as of february  the above table also does not include contingent bonus compensation agreements with certain of our employees 
the bonuses become payable if the individual is employed by us on the future payment date 
the amount of conditional bonuses that may be paid is million during fiscal and million during fiscal the above table does not reflect contingent purchase consideration related to the fourth quarter acquisition of gojane that is discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price includes contingent cash payments of up to an aggregate of million if certain financial metrics are achieved by the gojane business in the next five years 
the fair value of the contingent payments as of the acquisition date was estimated to be million based on expected probability of payment and we have recorded such liability on a discounted basis as of february  off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments set forth in the table above  we are not party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
as of february   we have not issued any letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventory or any capital expenditures 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
estimates by their nature are based on judgments and available information 
therefore  actual results could materially differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of operations and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in applying such policies  management must use significant estimates that are based on its informed judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
changes in such estimates  based on more accurate future information  may affect amounts reported in future periods 
merchandise inventory merchandise inventory consists of finished goods and is valued utilizing the cost method at lower of cost or market on a weighted average basis 
we use estimates during interim periods to record a provision for inventory shortage 
we also make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable selling price in order to assess that our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions are based on both historical experience and current information 
we believe that the carrying value of merchandise inventory is appropriate as of february  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for 
table of contents example  a difference in our estimate of the reserve on inventory at the lower of cost or market as of february  would have impacted net income by million for the fiscal year ended february  income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes asc 
under asc  income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity s financial statements and requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
for those tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are also recorded 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  accounting in interim periods  and expanded disclosure requirements see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the need to recognize impairment losses relating to long lived assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or under performing business trends 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
management makes assumptions and applies judgment to estimate future cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital 
these assumptions include factors such as historical and forecasted results and trends 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would write the asset down to fair value and we would record an impairment charge 
additionally  we have recorded store impairment charges of million for stores in fiscal compared to million for stores in fiscal and million for one store in fiscal see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
we believe that the carrying values of finite lived assets  and their useful lives  are appropriate as of february  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated which could result in additional impairments of store long lived assets in future periods  and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit retirement plan we maintain a serp  which is a non qualified defined benefit plan for certain officers 
the plan is non contributory  is not funded and provides benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment 
pension expense is determined using various actuarial cost methods to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to officers  and this cost is allocated to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the serp current liability of million and the serp non current liability of million is appropriately stated as of february  however  actual results may differ from those estimated and could have an impact on our consolidated financial statements in the future 
for example  if we had changed the expected discount rate by in fiscal  pension expense would have changed by less than  recent accounting developments see the section recent accounting developments included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and their impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of february   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
in june  bank of america  na issued a stand by letter of credit 
as of february   the outstanding letter of credit was million and expires on june  we do not have any other stand by or commercial letters of credit as of february  under the credit facility 
to the extent that we may borrow pursuant to the credit facility in the future  we may be exposed to market risk from interest rate fluctuations 
unrealized foreign currency gains and losses  resulting from the translation of our canadian subsidiary financial statements into our us dollar reporting currency  are reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the unrealized gain of approximately million is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of february  a movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a fair value translation fluctuation of approximately million  which would be recorded in other comprehensive income loss as an unrealized gain or loss 
we also face transactional currency exposures relating to merchandise that our canadian subsidiary purchases using us dollars 
these foreign currency transaction gains and losses are charged or credited to earnings as incurred 
we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation and transaction gains and losses to date have not been significant
