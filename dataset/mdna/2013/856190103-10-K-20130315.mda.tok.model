introduction the company is a bank holding company that was incorporated under the laws of the state of georgia in january to serve as the holding company for the bank 
the bank is a georgia state chartered bank that opened in october in pinehurst  georgia 
from october until july   the bank operated as a small community bank from two branch offices located in dooly county  georgia with total assets of approximately million  total loans receivable of approximately million  total deposits of approximately million and total shareholders equity of approximately million at december  on july   the bank raised approximately million in gross proceeds before expenses from investors in a private offering of its common stock 
in connection with the private offering  the fdic and the georgia department of banking and finance approved the interagency notice of change in control application filed by our new management team  which took control of the bank on july  since that date and through the date of this report  the bank has acquired billion in total assets and assumed billion in deposits from the fdic  as receiver  in twelve different failed bank transactions 
as a result of our failed bank acquisitions  the bank was transformed from a small community bank in pinehurst  georgia to a much larger commercial bank now operating full service branches throughout middle georgia and metropolitan atlanta 
as of december   our total assets were approximately billion  our total loans receivable were approximately billion  our total deposits were approximately billion and our total shareholders equity was approximately million 
our financial statements present two periods that reflect our historical basis of accounting for the period from january  through july  the predecessor period and our new basis of push down accounting for the period from july  through december  the successor period 
overview of financial results net income for the year ended december  was million  or 
per diluted share  compared with net income of million for  or per diluted share 
the following sections provide an overview of the major factors impacting the company financial performance in as well as information on certain important recent events 
total gross loans at the end of were down million  or  from december  although we experienced organic loan growth of million  or in  the resolution of our covered loans outpaced our organic growth which was driven by new loan originations 
covered loans decreased million  or  from december   as covered loans were paid down or charged off and submitted for loss share reimbursement 
total deposits at december  decreased approximately  or million  from december  during  we made a strategic decision to lower our cost of funds and strengthen our deposit mix 
as a result  our noninterest bearing deposits grew million  or  from year end  and comprised of total deposits at december  lower cost interest bearing deposits were down million  or over the same period 
higher cost time deposits at december  were down million  or compared to year end our net interest income on a taxable equivalent te basis was million for an increase of million  or  from average earning assets improved between these periods  with our net interest margin te increasing basis points to 
asset yields decreased basis points in primarily resulting from a combination of the changes in noncovered and covered loan yields  investment securities portfolio mix changes and decreased cost of funds 
our provision for loan losses was million in compared to a provision of million in the prior year 
the provision includes a covered loan loss provision and a noncovered loan loss provision 
net charge offs on noncovered loans for were  or 
of average loans  compared to net charge offs on noncovered loans of million  or 
of average loans  in the allowance for loan losses increased  to million at december  compared to million recorded at december  substantially all of the  increase came from additions to the allowance for covered loans 
the determination of allowances for noncovered and covered loans is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
noninterest income for decreased million  or  from the fdic receivable shifted from accretion to amortization in the amount of million  or during these periods as a result of changes in the re estimation of cash flows and expected losses that were less than originally projected 
also attributing to the decline in noninterest income year over year was a one time million gain on acquisitions during for  noninterest expenses of million were down million  or from the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in operating expenses in was primarily due to a decrease in the net costs of operations of other real estate as oreo activity has continued to stabilize during for  the net cost of operations of other real estate of million were down million compared to this decline was partially offset by a million increase in salaries and employee benefits resulting from increased staffing in various areas of the company 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we announced and paid two regular quarterly cash dividends to common shareholders of record 
the quarterly cash dividends were each 
per common share 
also in the fourth quarter of  the bank entered into an asset purchase agreement with altera payroll  inc  pursuant to which the bank acquired substantially all of the assets  and assumed certain liabilities of altera payroll  inc critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements  management is required to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical 
the accounting principles and methods we use conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general banking practices 
estimates and assumptions most significant to us relate primarily to the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  the accounting for acquired loans and the related fdic receivable for loss share agreements on covered assets and income taxes 
these significant estimates and assumptions are summarized in the following discussion and are further analyzed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses all we assess the adequacy of the all quarterly with respect to noncovered and covered loans  performing a separate analysis on each loan component 
the assessment begins with a standard evaluation and analysis of each loan 
all loans are consistently graded and monitored for changes in credit risk and possible deterioration in the borrower ability to repay the contractual amounts due under the loan agreement 
if a loan is impaired  under generally accepted accounting principles  we may measure the loss  or expected cash flow  either by the observable market price of the loan  the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
management evaluates the result of the all procedures performed  including the result of our testing  and makes a conclusion regarding the appropriateness of the all in its entirety 
allowance for loan losses for noncovered loans the all for noncovered loans consists of two components a specific amount representative of identified credit exposures that are readily predictable by the current performance of the borrower and underlying collateral  and a general amount  based upon historical losses  that is then adjusted for various stress factors representative of various economic factors and characteristics of the loan portfolio 
we establish the specific amount by examining impaired loans 
because the majority of our impaired loans are collateral dependent  we calculate nearly all of our specific allowances based on the fair value of the collateral  less disposal costs 
we establish the general amount by taking the remaining loan portfolio excluding those impaired loans discussed above with allocations based on our historical losses 
we then subject the calculation of the general amount to stress factors that are somewhat subjective 
the stress testing attempts to correlate the historical loss rates with current economic factors and current risks in the portfolio 
the stress factors consist of economic factors including changes in the local or national economy  the depth of experience in our lending staff  any concentrations of credit such as commercial real estate in any particular industry group  additional risks resulting from the level of speculative real estate loans in the portfolio  and seasoning of the loan portfolio 
after we assess the applicable factors  we evaluate the remaining amount based on management experience and we compare the level of the noncovered all with historical trends and peer information as a reasonableness test 
allowance for loan losses for covered loans on the date of an fdic assisted acquisition  management estimates the expected credit loss in the acquired loan portfolio and records the present value of the expected cash flows as the fair value of the acquired loans 
management determines which covered loans are placed in homogenous risk pools or reviewed specifically as part of the periodic cash flow re estimation process 
if a loan is placed in a pool  the overall performance of the pool will determine if any future all is required 
the covered loan all analysis represents management estimate of the potential additional impairment of the acquired loan portfolio over time 
typically  decreased estimated cash flows result in impairment  while increased estimated cash flows result in a full or partial reversal of previously recorded impairment and potentially the calculation of a higher effective yield 
higher actual cash flows than expected will result in a greater pay down of the covered loan  which decreases the recorded investment and therefore may cause an impairment reversal or higher effective yield 
lower actual cash flows than expected will result in a smaller pay down of the loan receivable and a higher recorded investment which may cause further impairment 
if our actual losses exceed the estimated losses  we will record a provision for loan losses on covered loans as an expense on our consolidated statement of income 
we also record an amount that will be recovered by us  under the related fdic loss share agreements  as a reduction of the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statement of income 
we review the assumptions used in the calculation of the updated expected cash flows  evaluate the impairment based on management experience  and use of peer information as part of our reasonableness test for the covered loan all 
accounting for acquired loans and related fdic receivable we account for our acquisitions under asc topic no 
 business combinations  which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting 
all identifiable assets acquired  including loans  are recorded at fair value 
no allowance for loan losses related to acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date as the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk 
loans acquired are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in asc topic no 
 exclusive of the loss share agreements with the fdic 
these fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal  interest and other cash flows 
over the life of the acquired loans  we will continue to estimate cash flows expected to be collected on individual loans or on pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics 
we evaluate at each balance sheet date whether the estimated cash flows and corresponding present value of the loans determined using the effective interest rates has decreased and if so  we will recognize a provision for loan losses in the consolidated statement of income 
for any increases in cash flows expected to be collected  we reverse any previous impairments and then  if appropriate  adjust the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan or pool 
because the fdic will reimburse us for certain loans acquired should we experience a loss  an indemnification asset the fdic loss share receivable  is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
the indemnification asset is recognized at the same time as the indemnified loan  and measured on the same basis  subject to collectability or contractual limitations 
the loss share agreements on the acquisition date reflect the reimbursements expected to be received from the fdic  using an appropriate discount rate  which reflects a discounting of future cash flows and other uncertainties 
the indemnification assets continue to be measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans 
because the acquired loans are subject to the accounting prescribed by asc topic  subsequent changes to the basis of the loss share agreements also follow that model 
deterioration in the credit quality of the loans immediately recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses would immediately increase the basis of the indemnification assets  with the offset recorded through the consolidated statement of income 
improvements in the credit quality or cash flows of loans reflected as an adjustment to yield and accreted into income over the remaining life of the loans decrease the basis of the indemnification assets  with such decreases being amortized into income over the same period or the life of the loss share agreements  whichever is shorter 
loss assumptions used in the basis of the indemnified loans are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the indemnification asset 
fair value accounting incorporates into the fair value of the indemnification asset an element of the time value of money  which is accreted back into income over the life of the loss share agreements 
upon the determination of an incurred loss  the indemnification asset will be reduced by the amount owed by the fdic 
a corresponding claim receivable is recorded until cash is received from the fdic 
the indemnification assets and claims receivable from the fdic are both included in fdic receivable for loss share agreements on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
for further discussion of the our acquisitions and loan accounting  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
income taxes income tax expense 
the calculation of our income tax expense requires significant judgment and the use of estimates 
we periodically assess tax positions based on current tax developments  including enacted statutory  judicial  regulatory  and industry guidance 
in analyzing our overall tax position  we consider the amount and timing of recognizing income tax liabilities and benefits 
in applying the tax and accounting guidance to the facts and circumstances  we adjust income tax balances appropriately through the income tax provision 
we maintain reserves for income tax uncertainties at levels we believe are adequate to absorb probable payments 
actual amounts paid  if any  could differ significantly from these estimates 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we assess deferred tax assets based on expected realizations  and we establish a valuation allowance for any amounts we do not expect to realize 
balance sheet review general at december   we had total assets of approximately billion  consisting principally of million in net noncovered loans  million in net covered loans  million in investment securities  million in fdic receivable  million in other real estate owned and million in cash and cash equivalents 
our liabilities at december  totaled billion  consisting principally of billion in deposits 
at december   our shareholders equity was million 
at december   we had total assets of billion  consisting principally of billion in net loans  million in investment securities  million in fdic receivable  million in other real estate owned and million in cash and cash equivalents 
our liabilities at december  totaled billion  consisting principally of billion in deposits 
at december   our shareholders equity was million 
investments the composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of revenue 
the investment securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral 
at december   we had million in our available for sale investment securities portfolio representing approximately of our total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at december  investment securities were down million  or  compared to december  the decreased investment in securities was due to management use of investment cash flows to reduce high cost deposits  management current projections for loan demand  and the bank overall management of interest rate risk 
investment securities with carrying values of million were pledged to secure public deposits or for other purposes at december  our investment portfolio primarily consists of us government sponsored agency mortgage backed securities  nonagency mortgage backed securities  us government agency securities  corporate bonds and municipal securities 
agency mortgage backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and are principally issued by quasi federal agencies such as federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac 
these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings  and the minimum monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
although investors generally assume that the federal government will support these agencies  it is under no obligation to do so 
other agency mortgage backed securities are issued by government national mortgage association ginnie mae  which is a federal agency  and are guaranteed by the us government 
the actual maturities of these mortgage backed securities will differ from their contractual maturities because the loans underlying the securities can prepay 
decreases in interest rates will generally cause an acceleration of prepayment levels 
in a declining interest rate environment  we may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from these prepayments in assets that have comparable yields 
in a rising rate environment  the opposite occurs prepayments tend to slow and the weighted average life extends 
this is referred to as extension risk  which can lead to lower levels of liquidity due to the delay of cash receipts  and can result in the holding of a below market yielding asset for a longer period of time 
at december   million  or  of our available for sale securities were invested in us government agencies  compared to million  or  as of december  at december   million  or  of our available for sale securities were invested in agency mortgage backed securities  compared to million  or  as of december  at december   million  or of our available for sale securities were invested in nonagency mortgage backed securities  compared to million  or  as of december  beginning in  we reduced our reinvestment of maturing fixed rate mortgage backed securities and us government agencies into floating rate nonagency mortgage backed securities 
this asset class significantly increased in value in to prices the bank no longer deemed advantageous  which moderated the degree of our reinvestment in this in class in our nonagency mortgage backed securities were purchased at significant market discounts compared to par value 
this allowed us to shorten the effective duration of the portfolio which helped position our balance sheet for a potential rising rate environment and to achieve a better mix of earning assets 
the underlying collateral consists of mortgages originated prior to with the majority being and earlier 
none of the collateral is subprime and we own the senior tranche of each bond

loans secured by real estate mortgages are the principal component of our loan portfolio 
most of our real estate loans are secured by commercial or residential property 
we do not generally originate traditional long term residential mortgages for our portfolio  but we do originate and hold traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans and home equity lines of credit 
even if the principal purpose of the loan is not to finance real estate  we obtain a security interest in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral  to increase the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan 
the current concentrations in our loan portfolio may not be indicative of concentrations in our loan portfolio in the future  as approximately of our loan portfolio at december   consisted of loans acquired in our fdic assisted acquisitions 
as our loan portfolio continues to transition from covered loans to a more traditional noncovered loan portfolio  we will attempt to maintain a relatively diversified loan portfolio to help reduce the risks inherent in concentrations in certain types of lending and collateral 
as seen below  during year ended  our noncovered loans increased by million  or  and our covered loans decreased by million  or  from december  we have planned for and expect these trends to continue 
our covered loans will decrease as they are collected  charged off or the underlying collateral is foreclosed on and sold 
our covered loans may increase in the future if we acquire more banks 
our noncovered loans will increase as we originate and purchase well underwritten loans 
due to the current economic environment  covered loans may decrease faster than noncovered loans increase  thereby resulting in a net decrease in loans receivable as experienced in the following tables summarizes the composition of our loan portfolio for the periods presented 
year ended december dollars in thousands noncovered loans covered loans total amount of gross total noncovered loans covered loans total amount of gross total noncovered loans covered loans total amount of gross total construction  land land development other commercial real estate total commercial real estate commercial industrial owner occupied real estate total commercial industrial residential real estate consumer other total gross loans receivable  net of deferred fees less allowance for loan losses total loans  net year ended december year ended december dollars in thousands noncovered loans covered loans total amount of gross total noncovered loans covered loans total amount of gross total construction  land land development other commercial real estate total commercial real estate commercial industrial owner occupied real estate total commercial industrial residential real estate consumer other total gross loans receivable  net of deferred fees less allowance for loan losses total loans  net maturities and sensitivity of loans to changes in interest rates the information in the following table is based on the contractual maturities of individual loans  including loans that may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of these loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon maturity 
actual repayments of loans may differ from the maturities reflected below because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties 
the following summarizes the loan maturity distribution by type and related interest rate characteristics at december  for our noncovered and covered loan portfolios in thousands one year or less after one but within five years after five years total noncovered loans commercial real estate commercial industrial residential real estate consumer other total gross loans gross loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates total loans covered loans commercial real estate commercial industrial residential real estate consumer other total gross loans gross loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates total loans fdic receivable for loss share agreements and clawback liability as of december   of our outstanding principal balance of loans and of our other real estate assets were covered under loss share agreements with the fdic in which the fdic has agreed to reimburse us either or of all losses incurred in connection with those assets 
we estimated the fdic reimbursement that will result from losses incurred as we dispose of covered loans and other real estate assets  and we recorded the estimate as a receivable from the fdic 
the fdic receivable for loss share agreements was million as of december  and million as of december  increases in expected losses in excess of acquisition date estimates will result in an increase in the fdic receivable 
the decline in the amount of fdic receivable is largely attributable to cash proceeds we received from the fdic related to our realized losses on covered assets  however  as cash flow estimates have improved for some loans and pools of loans  some of the reduction in has come from amortization of the related indemnification assets 
at the end of each of the loss share agreements with the fdic  with the exception of the six bank subsidiaries of security bank corporation  we may be required to reimburse the fdic in the event that losses on covered assets do not reach original expected losses  based on the initial discount received less cumulative servicing amounts for the covered assets acquired 
as of december  we have recorded a million liability to the fdic related to the northwest bank trust  community capital bank and piedmont community bank acquisitions  which is included with the fdic receivable for loss share agreements in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we recorded the fdic receivable at its estimated fair value at the date of each acquisition 
the initial fair value was established by discounting the expected cash flows with a market discount rate for like maturity and risk instruments 
the discount was to be accreted into noninterest income in connection with the expected timing of the related cash flows 
to the extent that currently estimated cash flows on covered loans are more than originally estimated and therefore projected losses are less than originally expected  the related reimbursements from the fdic contemplated in the indemnification assets are less  which produces amortization of those excess indemnification assets in noninterest income 
for the year ended december  this resulted in amortization expense on the fdic receivable of million 
we have received million from the fdic for reimbursement of losses and expenses that have occurred from the date of each acquisition through december  allowance for loan losses all the all represents the amount that management believes is necessary to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the all is critical to the portrayal and understanding of our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the determination and application of the all accounting policy involves judgments  estimates and uncertainties that are subject to change 
changes in these assumptions  estimates or the conditions surrounding them may have a material impact on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the all on our noncovered loan portfolio is determined based on factors such as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  delinquency trends  adequacy of collateral  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and economic conditions that may affect the borrower ability to pay 
the all for noncovered loans consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired 
the general component covers nonimpaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current economic factors 
historical losses are adjusted by a qualitative analysis that reflects several key economic indicators such as gross domestic product  unemployment and core inflation as well as asset quality trends  rate risk and unusual events or significant changes in personnel  policies or procedures 
the qualitative analysis requires judgment by management and is subject to continuous validation 
the all on our covered loan portfolio is determined based on expected future cash flows 
we record acquired loans at their acquisition date fair values  which are based on expected future cash flows and include an estimate for future loan losses 
on the date of acquisition  management determines which covered loans are placed in homogeneous risk pools or reviewed specifically as part of the periodic cash flow re estimation process 
if a loan is placed in a pool  the overall performance of the pool will determine if any future all is required 
the covered loan all analysis represents management estimate of the potential impairment of the acquired loan portfolio over time 
typically  decreased cash flows result in impairment  while increased cash flows result in a full or partial reversal of previously recorded impairment and potentially the calculation of a higher effective yield 
if our actual losses exceed the estimated losses  we will record a provision for loan losses on covered loans as an expense on our consolidated statement of income 
we also record an amount that will be recovered by us  under the related fdic loss share agreements  as a reduction of the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statement of income 
at december   our total all for noncovered and covered loans was million  an increase of  compared to december  the all at december  reflected net charge offs of million on noncovered and covered loans and total provisions for loan losses of million for the year ended december   net of million recorded through the fdic loss share receivable 
at december   our noncovered all increased million to million  compared to million at december  the provision for loan losses charged to expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in our noncovered all during is primarily due to loan growth 
the noncovered all to total noncovered loans held for investment was at december   compared to at december  during  we established the covered all due to evidence of additional credit deterioration in our covered loan portfolio subsequent to initial fair valuation 
at december   our covered all decreased million to million  compared to million at december   with a net provision for loan losses of million as of december   a million reduction from the million net provision as of december  the decrease in the covered all was primarily due to the continued decline in covered assets  which were reduced by million to million at december  the overall covered loan portfolio continues to perform in excess of our initial projections at the applicable acquisition dates 
however  the performance is not uniform across all asset classes and individual loans 
despite the net positive credit trends in covered loans  there remains the potential for future volatility within the provision for loan losses on covered loans 
as the majority of our covered loans are considered purchased credit impaired loans  our provision for loan losses in future periods will be most significantly influenced in the short term by differences in actual credit losses resulting from the resolution of problem loans from the estimated credit losses used in determining the estimated fair values of purchased impaired loans as of their acquisition or reestimation dates and subsequently 
for noncovered loans  the provision for loan losses will be affected by the loss potential of impaired loans and trends in the delinquency of loans  nonperforming loans and net charge offs  which may be more than our historical experience

management continuously monitors loans and transfers loans to nonaccrual status when they are days past due 
substantially all of our covered loans were acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality and are accounted for under asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
as a result  we do not consider loans acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality to be nonperforming assets as long as their expected cash flows can be estimated 
moreover  in addition to being covered by loss share agreements  these assets were marked to fair value at the time of acquisition  mitigating much of our potential loss on these assets 
at december   all loans accounted for under asc topic continue to be classified as performing loans  as the carrying value of the respective loan or pool of loans cash flows were considered estimable and probable of collection 
therefore  interest income is recognized through accretion of the difference between the carrying value of these loans and the present value of expected future cash flows 
management has included asset quality measures that excluded these loans in the table in this section 
noncovered nonaccrual loans are considered impaired and are valued at either the observable market price of the loan  the present value of expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the majority of our noncovered nonaccrual loans are collateral dependent and  therefore  are valued at the fair value of collateral 
the fair value of collateral is determined through a review of the appraised value and an assessment of the recovery value of the collateral through discounts related to various factors noted below 
when a loan reaches nonaccrual status  we review the appraisal on file and determine if the appraisal is current and valid 
a current appraisal is one that has been performed in the last twelve months  and a valid appraisal is one that we believe accurately and appropriately addresses current market conditions 
if the appraisal is more than twelve months old or if market conditions have deteriorated since the last appraisal  we will order a new appraisal 
in addition  we require a new appraisal at the time of foreclosure or repossession of the underlying collateral 
upon determining that an appraisal is both current and valid  management assesses the recovery value of the collateral  which involves the application of various discounts to the market value 
these discounts include the following length of time to market and sell the property  as well as expected maintenance costs  insurance and taxes and real estate commissions on sale 
we record other real estate owned at the estimated market value  less disposal costs  at the date of acquisition 
for noncovered loans  we will record either a specific allowance or a charge off against the allowance for loan losses if our review of the current appraisal or the new appraisal indicates a loss 
subsequently  we will review our noncovered allowance and replenish it as required by our allowance for loan loss model 
noncovered nonperforming loans remain on nonaccrual status until the factors that previously indicated doubtful collectability on a timely basis no longer exist 
specifically  we look at the following factors before returning a nonperforming loan to performing status documented evidence of debt service capacity  adequate collateral  and a minimum of six months of receiving payments as agreed 
loan modifications on noncovered loans constitute a troubled debt restructuring if we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider 
for loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings  we either compute the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  we may measure impairment based on the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral when the troubled debt restructuring is deemed collateral dependent 
we record the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the loan as a valuation allowance 
loan modifications on covered loans accounted for within a pool under asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  do not result in the removal of the loan from the pool even if the modification of the loan would otherwise be considered a troubled debt restructuring 
at december   we did not have any covered loans classified as troubled debt restructurings

total nonperforming covered assets accounted for and of total nonperforming assets at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had no accruing noncovered loans greater than days past due 
at december  and  a significant portion of the company covered loans were past due  including many that were days or greater past due 
however  as noted above  under asc  our covered loans are classified as performing  even though they are contractually past due  as long as their expected cash flows can be estimated and are probable of collection 
potential noncovered problem loans amounted to million  or  of total noncovered loans outstanding at december   compared to million  or  of total noncovered loans outstanding at december  potential noncovered problem loans are those loans where management has a concern about the financial health of a borrower that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan terms 
deposits total deposits at december  decreased approximately  or million  from december  during  we continued to enhance our deposit product offerings for both commercial and individual customers 
the level of deposits was also supported by relatively strong liquidity in our deposit base  limited alternative investment opportunities in the low rate environment and the availability of unlimited deposit insurance coverage on certain deposit products though december  interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on i interest rates offered by competitors  ii anticipated amount and timing of funding needs  iii availability and cost of alternative sources of funding  and iv anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates 
we regard our deposits as attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost 
deposits are regarded as an important part of our overall client relationship  which provide us opportunities to cross sell other services 
the overall mix of deposits improved during  with noninterest bearing deposits increasing million to approximately million and representing of total deposits  compared to at december  the increase in noninterest bearing deposits resulted primarily from new business checking accounts  many of which are related to commercial real estate lending customers 
interest bearing demand deposits decreased million in  primarily resulting from a decrease in tax receipts in some of our municipal deposit accounts  while interest bearing deposits in savings and money market accounts decreased million  primarily resulting from our ongoing strategy of lowering our cost of funds 
time deposits  which are comprised mostly of certificates of deposits cds  decreased million in the short duration of our cd portfolio provides an opportunity to aggressively reprice deposits 
due to our strategy of decreasing our cost of funds  we were not able to renew all maturing deposits 
customers with maturing cd in were offered lower rates at renewal resulting in some customers choosing not to renew or investing their deposits into other products 
the increase in demand deposits and the continued effort to reprice higher cost interest bearing deposits  resulted in an average cost of funds of basis points for the year ended compared to basis points as of december  the following table shows the composition of deposits at december   and as of december dollars in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total noninterest bearing demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market accounts time deposits less than  time deposits  or greater total deposits the following table shows the average balance amounts and the average rates paid on deposits held by us for the years ended december   and years ended december dollars in thousands amount average rate amount average rate amount average rate noninterest bearing demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market accounts time deposits less than  time deposits  or greater total deposits the maturity distribution of our time deposits of  or greater at december  was as follows in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six though twelve months over twelve months total borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities the following table outlines our various sources of borrowed funds for the years ended december   and and the amounts outstanding at the end of each period  the maximum amount for each component during such period  the average amounts outstanding for each period and the average interest rate that we paid for each borrowing source 
the maximum month end balance represents the high indebtedness for each component of borrowed funds at any time during each of the periods shown 
the bank has participation agreements with various provisions regarding collateral position  pricing and other matters where the junior participation interests were sold 
the terms of the agreements do not convey proportionate ownership rights with equal priority to each participating interest and entitles the bank to receive principal and interest payments before other participating interest holders 
therefore  the participations sold do not qualify for sale treatment in accordance with guidance provided in asc topic  accounting for transfers of financial assets  because they do not qualify as participating interests 
the bank recorded the transactions as secured borrowings 
at december   the balance of the secured borrowings were million  a decrease of approximately  from december  the loans are recorded at their gross balances outstanding on the balance sheet

at december   we exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements as shown in the table below 
at december   our shareholders equity was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at december  the primary factors affecting changes in shareholder equity were our net income and increases in accumulated other comprehensive income during  net of dividends declared and paid 
on july   the bank raised approximately million in gross proceeds before expenses from investors in a private offering of its common stock  including the sale of  shares of common stock to accredited investors at per share 
following this recapitalization  the bank raised an additional million in common equity through the sale of  shares and  warrants to acquire shares of common stock to certain investors  including officers  directors and employees of the bank 
in october  the company raised an additional  in common equity through the sale of  shares and  warrants to acquire shares of common stock to certain members of the bank senior management and one of our directors

to be considered well capitalized under capital guidelines  the bank must maintain total risk based capital  tier i capital and leverage ratios of   and  respectively 
to be considered adequately capitalized under capital guidelines  the company must maintain total risk based capital of and tier i and leverage ratios of 
although tier and tier capital increased from december   tier risk based capital and total risk based capital ratios decreased 
the increase in tier capital was mainly a result of net income retained during the year 
the tier capital increase was a result of the increase in the allowance for loan losses on both covered and noncovered loans during risk weighted assets increased from december  which offset the increases in capital 
the increase in risk weighted assets was attributable in large part to the increase in our noncovered loan portfolio at higher risk weights compared to the decrease in our covered loan portfolio at lower risk weights 
the following table shows the bank and the company regulatory capital ratios for the periods presented 
december  bank company bank company bank company leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio the company  the bank  and certain of the bank executive officers entered into a capital maintenance agreement with the fdic 
under the terms of the agreement  the bank must at all times maintain a leverage ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
the agreement terminates on december  at december  the bank was in compliance with the capital maintenance agreement 
regulatory policy statements provide that generally bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings and that the level of dividends must be consistent with current and expected capital requirements 
dividends received from our subsidiary bank have been our primary source of funds available for the payment of dividends to shareholders 
federal and state banking laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends subsidiary banks may distribute without prior regulatory approval 
as of december   our subsidiary bank had no dividend capacity to pay dividends to us without prior regulatory approval 
on september  and december   the company paid a cash dividend of 
per common share to its shareholders 
off balance sheet arrangements commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as the customer has not violated any material condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee 
at december   unfunded commitments to extend credit were million 
a significant portion of the unfunded commitments related to commercial and residential real estate and consumer equity lines of credit 
based on experience  we anticipate that a significant portion of these lines of credit will not be funded 
we evaluate each customer creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit  is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower 
the type of collateral varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and commercial and residential real estate 
at december   there were commitments totaling approximately million under letters of credit 
the credit risk and collateral involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
because most of the letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  they do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we have entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling million as of december   for the purpose of converting fixed rate loans to variable rates 
the fair value of the swaps were million as of december  and were recorded as a liability  compared to the fair value of million recorded as a liability as of december  note to the consolidated financial statements located in part ii  item of this annual report on form k provides additional information on these contracts 
except as disclosed in this report  we are not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships or commitments  unconsolidated related entities that have off balance sheet arrangements  or other off balance sheet transactions that could result in liquidity needs that significantly impact earnings 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we have various outstanding contractual obligations that will require future cash outflows 
the following table presents our largest contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year to years to years more than years operating lease obligations operating lease obligations increased as a result of a newly executed lease agreement effective january  for office space in metro atlanta 
the lease covers  square feet of office space with a term of years 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss  and the ability to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves monitoring our sources and uses of funds to meet the operating  capital and strategic needs of the company and the bank 
liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of our investment portfolio is fairly predictable and subject to a high degree of control when we make investment decisions 
net deposit inflows and outflows  however  are far less predictable and are not subject to the same degree of certainty 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through scheduled payments  maturities and repayments of loans and investment securities 
cash and short term investments such as federal funds sold and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks are also sources of funding 
as we dispose of our covered loans and assets  the collection of the fdic receivable provides an additional source of funding 
at december   our liquid assets  which consist of cash and amounts due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions and federal funds sold  amounted to million  or of total assets 
our available for sale securities at december  amounted to million  or of total assets 
investment securities and lines of credit traditionally provide a secondary source of liquidity because they can be converted into cash in a timely manner 
the liability portion of the balance sheet serves as our primary source of liquidity 
we plan to meet our future cash needs through the generation of deposits 
core customer deposits have historically provided a sizeable source of relatively stable and low cost funds 
at december   core deposits were of net loans  compared with at december  we maintain seven federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks totaling million 
we are also a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb  from whom we can borrow for leverage or liquidity purposes 
the fhlb requires that securities and qualifying loans be pledged to secure any advances 
at december   we had no advances from the fhlb and a remaining credit availability of million 
in addition  we maintain a line with the federal reserve bank discount window of million secured by certain loans in our loan portfolio 
as a result of the dodd frank act  effective as of december   unlimited fdic insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts was extended through december  this component of the dodd frank act served to extend unlimited insurance coverage which was initially established by the fdic transaction account guarantee program tagp on october  under the law  insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand deposits declined to a level of  per depositor after december  the bank did not experience any significant liquidity event due to the expiration of tagp nor does it anticipate any future liquidity event as a result of the expiration 
asset liability management market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates  which principally arise from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  deposit gathering and borrowing activities 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not generally arise in the normal course of our business 
asset liability management is the process by which we monitor and control the mix and maturities of our assets and liabilities 
the essential purposes of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize potentially adverse effects on earnings from changes in market interest rates 
our financial risk committee monitors and considers methods of managing exposure to interest rate risk 
the financial risk committee is responsible for maintaining the level of interest rate sensitivity of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities within board approved limits 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe that minimizes the changes in net interest income 
in the event of a shift in interest rates  management may take certain actions intended to mitigate the negative impact on net interest income or to maximize the positive impact on net interest income 
these actions may include  but are not limited to  restructuring of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  seeking alternative funding sources or investment opportunities and modifying the pricing or terms of loans and deposits 
we regularly review our exposure to changes in interest rates 
among the factors we consider are changes in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  interest rate spreads and repricing periods 
typically  our financial risk committee reviews  on at least a quarterly basis  our interest rate risk position 
the primary tool used to analyze our interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity is an earnings simulation model 
the bank also monitors the present value of assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios  and  to a lesser extent  monitoring the difference  or gap  between rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
this earnings simulation model projects a baseline net interest income assuming no changes in interest rate levels and estimates changes to that baseline net interest income resulting from changes in interest rate levels 
we rely primarily on the results of this model in evaluating our interest rate risk 
this model incorporates a number of additional factors including the expected exercise of call features on various assets and liabilities  the expected rates at which various rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities will reprice  the expected growth in various interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the expected interest rates on new assets and liabilities  the expected relative movements in different interest rate indexes which are used as the basis for pricing or repricing various assets and liabilities  existing and expected contractual cap and floor rates on various assets and liabilities  expected changes in administered rates on interest bearing transaction  savings  money market and time deposit accounts and the expected impact of competition on the pricing or repricing of such accounts  cash flow and accretion expectations from loans acquired in fdic transactions  and other relevant factors 
inclusion of these factors in the model is intended to more accurately project our expected changes in net interest income resulting from interest rate changes 
we typically model our changes in net interest income assuming interest rates go up basis points  up basis points  down basis points and down basis points 
for purposes of this model  we have assumed that the changes in interest rates phase in over a month period 
while we believe this model provides a reasonably accurate projection of our interest rate risk  the model includes a number of assumptions and predictions which may or may not be correct and may impact the model results 
these assumptions and predictions include inputs to compute baseline net interest income  growth rates  expected changes in administered rates on interest bearing deposit accounts  competition and a variety of other factors that are difficult to accurately predict 
accordingly  there can be no assurance the earnings simulation model will accurately reflect future results 
the following table presents the earnings simulation model projected impact of a change in interest rates on the projected baseline net interest income for the month period commencing january  based on the simulation run at december   annual net interest income would be expected to decrease approximately  if rates increased from current rates by basis points 
if rates increased basis points from current rates  net interest income is projected to decrease approximately 
if they decreased basis points from current rates  net interest income is projected to increase 
this change in interest rates assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve and does not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve shift in interest rates in basis points change in projected baseline net interest income not meaningful in the event of a shift in interest rates  management may take certain actions intended to mitigate the negative impact on net interest income or to maximize the positive impact on net interest income 
these actions may include  but are not limited to  restructuring of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  seeking alternative funding sources or investment opportunities  modifying the pricing or terms of loans and deposits and using derivatives 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets  as well as any accretion income on covered loans under our loss share agreements with the fdic  and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities and is our primary source of earnings 
net interest income depends upon the relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the ratio of interest earning assets to total assets and of interest bearing liabilities to total funding sources and movements in market interest rates 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis te was million for  an increase of million  or from the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from a million decrease in interest expense on deposits which can be attributed to our improved deposit mix and continued repricing of higher cost time deposits 
similarly in  net interest income te increased million  or from the decrease was also attributable to lower interest expense on deposits in related to our aggressively managed deposit rates and deposit mix while considering liquidity requirements  which also resulted in an overall decrease in the cost of funds 
the decrease in interest expense on deposits resulted from a decline in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits to 
in compared to in  in addition to a million decrease in the average balances outstanding 
the decrease in the average rate paid on deposits was a result of an overall decrease in market rates across all deposit products and a concerted effort to reduce cost of funding 
the cost of funds decreased basis points to 
for compared to 
for also contributing to the overall lower rate paid was a shift in deposit mix away from higher cost time deposits to lower cost transaction deposits 
noninterest bearing deposits increased to of total deposits at december  compared to at december  for the year ended december   interest expense decreased million  or from this decrease was largely affected by a decline in cost of funds by basis points during  which was mainly attributable to the shift in our funding mix along with aggressive repricing schedules 
the overall yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to in  while the net interest margin te increased basis points to 
the overall change in the earning asset yield and net interest margin is a combination of the loan portfolio shifting from higher yielding covered loans to lower yielding noncovered loans as well as the lower cost of funding 
noncovered loan yields continue to trend downward in  declining basis points from the previous year  primarily as a result of competitive pressures and the prolonged low interest rate environment 
offsetting this decline was the continued volatility in our covered loan yields  resulting in a basis point increase in compared to this volatility is a result of  but not limited to  increases in estimated cash flow  earlier than expected payoffs on covered loans and gains on closeouts of pools 
the cost of funds decreased basis points compared to primarily due to a decrease in market rates of interest across all deposit products and continued repricing of higher cost time deposits 
also attributing to the improvement in the net interest margin year over year was an increase in investment securities yields 
the overall yield on investment securities has improved basis points from to the increase is primarily attributable to a portfolio mix change which has resulted in lower yielding securities transitioning from the portfolio through payoffs and maturities while being replaced with higher yielding securities 
yields on earning assets decreased basis points in compared to the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in the yield on noncovered loans driven by a lower interest rate environment 
the basis point decline in net interest margin compared to resulted from a combination of factors including  among others  a reduced level of covered loans  decrease in noncovered loan and taxable investment securities yields  partially offset by a reduction in the average rates paid on deposits

rate volume analysis net interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volumes

this allocation is based on the absolute dollar amounts of change due solely to changes in volume or rate 
provision for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses on both noncovered and covered loans through a provision for loan losses charged as an expense on our consolidated statements of income 
we review our noncovered loan portfolio  consisting of loans that are not covered by loss share agreements with the fdic  on a quarterly basis to evaluate our outstanding loans and to measure both the performance of the portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
please see the discussion above under balance sheet review allowance for loan losses for a description of the factors we consider in determining the amount of periodic provision expense to maintain this allowance 
there was no allowance for loan losses at the dates of acquisition for the covered loans in our loan portfolio that we acquired under loss share agreements with the fdic because we recorded these loans at fair value at the time of each respective acquisition 
we periodically evaluate the recorded investment in our covered loans and compare our actual losses to estimated losses to determine whether additional allowance is necessary 
this quarterly re estimation of cash flows expected to be collected is updated based on changes to assumptions regarding default rates  loss severities and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions 
if our re estimated losses exceed the last estimated losses  we record a provision on our statement of income 
in that event  due to the fdic loss share agreements  we would bear a net expense between and of the estimated loss  depending upon the applicable loss share agreement to which the loss is related 
conversely  if expected cash flows improve from the last estimates  any previous impairment is partially or fully reversed and an adjustment to yield is recognized over the remaining life of the loan or pool 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded loan loss provisions of million  million and million  respectively related to noncovered loans 
the amount of noncovered loan loss provision recorded in each year was the amount required such that the total allowance for loan losses reflected the appropriate balance  in management opinion  to sufficiently cover probable losses in the noncovered loan portfolio 
net charge offs on noncovered loans for were  or 
of average loans  compared to net charge offs on noncovered loans of million  or  and million  or 
for and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses on covered loans was million in  compared to a provision of million in no provision expense on covered loans was recorded for the year ended december  the amount of covered loan loss provision recorded in each year was the result of re estimated cash flows 
when re estimated cash flows are less than original estimates  an immediate recognition through a provision for loan losses is recorded 
conversely  when expected cash flows improve from original estimates  any previous impairment is partially or fully reversed and an adjustment to yield is recognized over the remaining life of the loan or pool  which occurred for certain other covered loans and loan pools during both and noninterest loss income noninterest loss for totaled million  down million from during  the fdic receivable shifted from accretion of the discount on the indemnification asset to amortization of the indemnification asset itself 
also contributing to the decline was a one time gain on acquisitions during the following table presents the components of noninterest income for the three years ended december   and in thousands amortization accretion of fdic receivable for loss share agreements service charges on deposits mortgage banking income gain loss on sale of investment securities gain on fhlb stock redemptions payroll fee income gain on acquisitions atm income other total noninterest loss income net amortization of the fdic receivable totaled million for  a variance of million from the million in net accretion in to the extent that currently estimated cash flows on covered loans are more than originally estimated and therefore projected losses are less than originally expected  the related reimbursements from the fdic contemplated in the indemnification assets are less  which produces amortization of those excess indemnification assets in noninterest income 
at the same time  lower projected losses cause loan accretion yields to increase over the remaining life of the applicable covered loans 
for the year ended december  accretion income decreased million  or from similar to current year  the decrease in accretion income of the fdic receivable is due to changes in assumptions during the quarterly re estimation of cash flows 
service charges on deposits for were down  or from overdraft fees have declined  as a result of decreased utilization of our courtesy overdraft services and is largely attributable to federal government regulations  specifically the dodd frank act  that impact the nature and pricing of services offered by the bank  in addition to changes in consumer behavior 
income from service charges decreased  or from the decrease was primarily related to insufficient funds checks and the bank bounce protection product  which was also affected by customer behavior and regulatory changes 
payroll fee income of  for was the result of the acquisition of the assets and business of altera payroll  inc during third quarter of gains on federal home loan bank fhlb stock redemptions decreased million  or  compared to there were no gains on fhlb stock redemptions recorded for the year ended december  the gains are nonrecurring components of noninterest income as these gains result from original discounts recorded on acquired fhlb stock that has since been able to be redeemed at the full undiscounted cost basis of the acquired bank 
as of december   there were no discounts remaining on acquired fhlb stock 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for totaled million  down million from the following table presents the components of noninterest expense for each of the three years ended december   and in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment legal and professional fees marketing federal insurance premiums and other regulatory fees net cost of operations of real estate owned data processing amortization of intangibles other total noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits is the single largest component of noninterest expense  which increased million  or  in compared to the year over year increase is a result of a strategic decision to increase staffing in the areas of risk  audit and compliance 
salaries and employee benefits consists of salaries  stock based compensation expenses  other employee benefits and payroll taxes 
for the year ended december  salaries and employee benefits expense increased million  or from due to the addition of key positions in support areas being filled  merit increases and increases in head count due to our fdic assisted acquisitions in late occupancy and equipment expense was up million  or  in the primary component of the increase is related to a lease agreement for our administrative offices which was effective the second half of and full year lease expense related to the lease agreement was approximately million in and  in occupancy and equipment expense remained relatively stable between and  increasing  or during marketing expense for was down million  or  from a major component of marketing expense is charitable contributions which declined million from as significant donations made in were not repeated in for the year ended december   marketing expense increased  or from the stability in the change year over year was primarily impacted by the charitable contribution noted above which occurred in and federal deposit insurance premiums and fees for were down  from and for were down million from the decrease in deposit insurance premiums year over year is a result of a change in the calculation of the fdic assessment for all banks in late to base assessments on assets rather than deposits 
this change had the effect of decreasing assessments for smaller banks that are almost exclusively deposit funded 
net cost of operations of other real estate owned was down million or  from the decrease in other real estate owned expense is directly related to a reduction in volume from one period to the next of other real estate covered by loss share agreements with the fdic 
for the year ended december   these costs included gains on sales of other real estate of  and expenses related to the management and collection of other real estate of million 
for the year ended december   these costs included losses on sales of other real estate of million and expenses related to the management and collection of other real estate of million 
for the year ended december   net cost of operations of other real estate were down million  or from which also resulted from a decline in the volume of other real estate covered by loss hare agreements with the fdic 
as management continues to work through and dispose of these covered assets  the expense should continue to decline at a steady rate  absent additional acquisitions 
income taxes income tax expense is composed of both state and federal income tax expense 
income tax expense declined million  or  compared to  as a result of a decrease in taxable income  as well as  steps taken by management to utilize various available tax credits to reduce state income taxes 
for the year ended december   income tax expense decreased million  or from as a result of different tax strategies employed by us to reduce state income taxes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding income tax considerations 
fourth quarter results net income for the fourth quarter of was million  or 
per diluted common share  compared to million  or  and million  or  respectively in the third quarter of and fourth quarter of the following discussion highlights recent factors impacting our results of operations and financial position 
net interest income was million for the fourth quarter ended december  compared to million for the third quarter ended september  the increase in net interest income of million was partially a result of increased accretion income of million due to more early payoffs and a gain from a loan pool close out in the fourth quarter 
net interest expense decreased  from the third quarter and reflects our continued strategic decision to lower our cost of funds and manage deposit mix by repricing higher cost deposits 
in the fourth quarter  we recognized million in provision expense on our covered loans  a decrease of million from the third quarter 
the need for additional provision expense is primarily the result of deterioration in the expected cash flows in certain residential loan pools  as well as specifically reviewed loans 
noninterest income was a negative million for the fourth quarter ended december  compared to a negative million for the third quarter ended september  the decrease in noninterest income is due to an increase in the amortization of the fdic receivable of million during the fourth quarter related to the quarterly re estimation of cash flows 
additionally  the decrease  which was offset by increases attributed to gains on fhlb stock redemptions and payroll fee income  a new component of noninterest income associated with the acquisition of altera payroll  inc in the fourth quarter of noninterest expense was million for the quarter  an increase of million from the third quarter 
salaries and employee benefits was the largest contributing factor of expense rising million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 
this was due to an incentive accrual reversal in the third quarter of and a strategic decision to increase staffing in the areas of risk  audit and compliance 
increases in legal and professional expenses  marketing  federal insurance premiums and other regulatory fees and expenses related to other real estate further contributed million to noninterest expense
