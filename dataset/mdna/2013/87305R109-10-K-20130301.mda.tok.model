we present ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
we provide our ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of our three most recent fiscal years and our financial condition at december  except for historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a leading global provider of time critical and technologically complex printed circuit board pcb products and backplane assemblies pcbs populated with electronic components  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
we provide our customers time to market and advanced technology products and offer a one stop manufacturing solution to customers from engineering support to prototype development through final volume production 
we serve a diversified customer base in various markets throughout the world  including manufacturers of networking communications infrastructure products  touch screen tablets and mobile media devices cellular phones and smartphones 
we also serve high end computing  commercial aerospace defense  and industrial medical industries 
our customers include both original equipment manufacturers oems and electronic manufacturing services ems providers 
in april  we acquired from meadville all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of four of its subsidiaries 
these four companies and their respective subsidiaries  collectively referred to as the pcb subsidiaries  comprised meadville s pcb manufacturing and distribution business 
see note in our consolidated financial statements 
labor expense has increased in our asia pacific operating segment beginning in the second quarter of due to both prc government mandated wage increases and additional compensation offered to our labor force as a result of a reduction of overtime hours that was implemented to meet standards required by some of our global customers 
this increased labor expense reduced the gross and operating margins of our asia pacific operating segment in management believes such wage increases will continue during and may further reduce gross and operating margins in asia pacific 
while our customers include both oem and ems providers  we measure customers based on oem companies as they are the ultimate end customers 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed orders of  or more in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately  customers and as of december   we had approximately  customers 
sales to our largest customers accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 
the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated end markets aerospace defense cellular phone computing storage peripherals medical industrial instrumentation other networking communications other total 
table of contents sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 
smartphones are included in the cellular phone end market  tablet pcs are included in the computing storage peripherals end market and other mobile devices such as e readers are included in the other end market 
for pcbs  we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype  and new product introduction work  in addition to unexpected short term demand among our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and the time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time products 
we also deliver a significant percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we typically receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of pcbs and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective pcbs and backplane assemblies 
we record an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products as well as stock based compensation expense 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume  and yield 
we generally do not participate in any significant long term contracts with suppliers  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff  stock based compensation expense as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense  stock based compensation expense  bad debt expense  gains or losses on the sale or disposal of property  plant and equipment  and acquisition related expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management to make judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
these policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the 
table of contents carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  derivative instruments and hedging activities  realizability of deferred tax assets  and determining self insurance reserves 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and judgments as to expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
inventories in assessing the realizability of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
when the market value of inventory is less than the carrying value  the inventory cost is written down to its estimated net realizable value  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
we maintain certain finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements with those customers 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
sales returns and allowances we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale using our judgment based on historical information and anticipated returns as a result of current period sales 
to the extent actual experience varies from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
long lived assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  definite lived intangibles  and goodwill 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
as necessary  we make judgments regarding future cash flow forecasts in the assessment of impairment 
during the fourth quarter of each year  and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation  we perform our annual impairment assessment of goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows and market approach analyses as considered necessary 
we consider factors such as the state of the economy and reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with a decline in our market capitalization for a sustained period as indicators for potential goodwill impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for the years ended december  and  our assessment of goodwill 
table of contents impairment indicated that the carrying values of goodwill for our asia pacific reporting unit  in our asia pacific operating segment  and our shanghai backplane assembly reporting unit  in our north america operating segment  were in excess of fair value  and therefore goodwill was impaired 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also assess other long lived assets  specifically definite lived intangibles and property  plant and equipment  for potential impairment given similar impairment indicators 
when indicators of impairment exist related to our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets  we use an estimate of the undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether the carrying amount of the assets is recoverable 
measurement of the amount of impairment  if any  is based upon the difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including cost based  market and income approaches as considered necessary  which involve judgments related to future cash flows and the application of the appropriate valuation model 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the asia pacific operating segment 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
derivative instruments and hedging activities as a matter of policy  we use derivatives for risk management purposes  and we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
derivatives are typically entered into as hedges of changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and other risks 
when we determine to designate a derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge  we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  the hedging instrument  the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged  how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed  and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivative that is used in hedging transactions is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet with measurement at fair value 
fair value of the derivative instruments is determined using pricing models developed based on the underlying swap interest rate  foreign currency exchange rates  and other observable market data as appropriate 
the values are also adjusted to reflect nonperformance risk of the counterparty and the company  as necessary 
for derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  to the extent the derivative is effective at offsetting the changes in cash flow being hedged until the hedged item affects earnings 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded in earnings each period 
income taxes deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized based on our estimate of future taxable income 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to establish a valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
in addition  we are subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
additionally  our calculations of income taxes are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 

table of contents self insurance we are primarily self insured in north america for group health insurance and worker s compensation benefits provided to our us employees  and we purchase insurance to protect against annual claims at the individual and aggregate level 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not reported at the end of each reporting period 
we use our judgment using our historical claim data and information and analysis provided by actuarial and claim advisors  our insurance carriers and brokers on an annual basis to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to individual insured stop loss coverage for both programs  which is  per individual 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 
results of operations included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  are days of results of operations for the asia pacific operations for the period from april  through december  the following table sets forth the relationship of various items to net sales in our consolidated statement of operations year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of definite lived intangibles impairment of goodwill and definite lived intangibles impairment of long lived assets total operating expenses operating loss income other income expense interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt other  net total other expense  net loss income before income taxes income tax provision net loss income less net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interest net loss income attributable to ttm technologies  inc stockholders we manage our worldwide operations based on two geographic operating segments asia pacific  which consists of the pcb subsidiaries and their seven pcb fabrication plants  which include a substrate facility  and north america  which consists of seven domestic pcb fabrication plants  including a facility that provides follow on value added services primarily for one of the pcb fabrication plants  and one backplane assembly plant in shanghai  china  which is managed in conjunction with our us operations 
each segment operates predominantly in the same industry with production facilities that produce similar customized products for their customers and use similar means of product distribution 

table of contents the following table compares net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands net sales asia pacific north america total sales inter segment sales total net sales net sales total net sales decreased by million  or  from  million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  net sales for the asia pacific operating segment  excluding inter segment sales  decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   mainly due to lower demand in our networking communications and computing end markets  partially offset by increased demand in our cellular phone and other end markets 
this reduction in demand  which resulted in a decline in pcb shipments from the year ended december   was primarily due to global macroeconomic weakness as well as lower infrastructure spending by telecommunications companies 
the average pcb selling price increased by  which was driven primarily by the product mix shift from conventional pcbs and standard hdi pcbs toward higher priced advanced hdi pcbs 
net sales for the north america operating segment decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower demand in our networking communications and aerospace defense end markets 
this decrease in demand  which resulted in a decline in pcb shipments from december   was primarily due to global macroeconomic weakness  uncertainty around potential us defense spending cuts and lower telecommunications infrastructure spending 
the decline was partially offset by a increase in the average pcb selling price due to greater advanced technology product mix 
in addition  demand for backplane assemblies  largely from networking communications customers  decreased by from the year ended december  total net sales increased by million  or  from  million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  net sales for the asia pacific operating segment  excluding inter segment sales  increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of asia pacific net sales in compared to months in due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april in addition  we experienced an increase in pcb prices of approximately resulting from a product mix shift from standard hdi and conventional pcbs to advanced hdi pcbs  partially offset by a decrease of approximately in daily pcb production 
net sales from advanced hdi pcbs as a percentage of asia pacific net sales increased from approximately for the year ended december  to approximately for the year ended december  net sales for the north america operating segment decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decline in net sales reflects a decrease in pcb sales volume of and the closure of our hayward  california backplane assembly facility  partially offset by a increase in average pcb selling price and increased sales at our other backplane assembly facilities 
the inter segment sales are sales from the asia pacific operating segment to the north america operating segment 

table of contents cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased million  or  from  million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold for the asia pacific operating segment increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold for the asia pacific operating segment increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to higher labor costs in china  increased depreciation expense and lower fixed cost absorption due to the decline in net sales 
the higher labor costs in our asia pacific operating segment were driven by both prc government mandated wage increases and additional compensation offered to our labor force as a result of a reduction of overtime hours that was implemented to meet standards required by some of our global customers 
included in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  are approximately million of costs related to the temporary closure of our sye facility in dongguan  china 
these costs consist primarily of labor costs and depreciation expense 
cost of goods sold for the north america operating segment decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold for the north america operating segment increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to higher labor expense as a percentage of net sales and lower fixed cost absorption due to the decline in net sales  partially offset by a lower mix of backplane assemblies  which have a higher direct material content 
total cost of goods sold increased by million from million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold related to the asia pacific operating segment increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of costs following our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april the increase in costs was also due to higher labor costs in asia and increased overhead  mainly driven by higher depreciation expense 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold related to the asia pacific operating segment increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  for the reasons mentioned above 
cost of goods sold related to the north america operating segment decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and lower labor costs at several pcb manufacturing plants 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold for the north america operating segment increased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  gross profit as a result of the foregoing  gross profit decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  overall gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due primarily to higher labor costs and depreciation expense  lower fixed cost absorption on lower production in our conventional pcb facilities  which has caused our capacity utilization to decline  and costs related to the temporary closure of our sye facility in dongguan  china 
gross profit increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the overall gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher labor costs in china and increases in depreciation expense in our asia pacific operating segment 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in commission expense on lower net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in 
table of contents selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales is due to lower net sales and the fixed portion of selling expense  offset slightly by the decline in commission expense  as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decline in selling and marketing expense for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales is due to the inclusion of a full year of results for the asia pacific operating segment  which has lower selling expenses than our north america operating segment 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expense primarily relates to higher bad debt expense  increased stock based compensation expense as well as increased labor costs partially offset by lower incentive bonus compensation expense 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased due to increased expense and a decline in net sales for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expense for the year ended december  primarily relates to inclusion of a full year of results for the asia pacific operating segment 
the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is related primarily to million of acquisition related costs incurred in amortization of definite lived intangibles intangible amortization expense decreased by million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  due to the million impairment of customer relationships in the third quarter of see explanation below for impairment of goodwill and definite lived intangibles 
intangible amortization expense increased by million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  due to the inclusion of a full year of results for the asia pacific operating segment 
identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships  trade name and licensing agreements 
impairment of goodwill and definite lived intangibles during the third quarter of  we performed an interim evaluation of goodwill and definite lived intangibles as we believed there were impairment triggering events and circumstances which warranted an evaluation 
these circumstances included continued decreases in operating profit due to softer revenues and shifts in product mix when compared with projected results 
these factors led to weaker performance than we expected for the year ended december  as a result  we recorded a charge for the impairment of goodwill and definite lived intangibles in the amount of million for the year ended december   consisting of charges of million for goodwill and million for definite lived intangibles related to our asia pacific reporting unit 
if the market outlook and operating performance of our asia pacific reporting unit does not recover to expected levels in future quarters  further goodwill impairment may be warranted 
at december   the carrying value of goodwill in our asia pacific reporting unit amounted to approximately million 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our shanghai backplane assembly facility  which was part of our acquisition of tyco s pcb business 
as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing  giving consideration to factors such as 
table of contents weakening demand for this facility s products  as well as price pressure from a key telecommunications infrastructure customer and reduced expectations for future cash flows as indicators for potential goodwill impairment  we determined that the carrying value of our shanghai backplane assembly reporting unit  which is included as a part of our north america operating segment  exceeded its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge 
impairment of long lived assets during the third quarter of  in conjunction with the evaluation of goodwill and definite lived intangibles  we believed there were impairment triggering events and circumstances which warranted an evaluation of certain long lived assets 
these circumstances included continued decreases in operating profitability due to softer revenues and shifts in product mix when compared with projected results 
these factors led to weaker performance than we expected for the year ended december  specifically  two real estate assets in the asia pacific operating segment were evaluated for impairment due to current and expected underutilization and limited market demand 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge in the asia pacific operating segment for the two manufacturing buildings in the amount of million for the year ended december  to reduce the carrying value to its fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million to reduce the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the asia pacific operating segment 
the impairment charge includes million related to manufacturing equipment held for use at a plant acquired by meadville in we had previously reduced the carrying value for some of these assets during our purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries 
weaker than expected operating performance at this manufacturing plant in the first six months of  resulting from a downturn in the profitability of its products as well as a reduction in expected future demand for these products  resulted in an asset impairment during the second quarter of based on the undiscounted cash flows for this plant  an impairment of the manufacturing assets was indicated 
in addition  the manufacturing equipment at this plant cannot be used at our other manufacturing sites 
the fair value of these manufacturing assets was determined using a discounted cash flow model over their remaining useful life with the impairment being the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset group 
the impairment charge also includes million related to manufacturing equipment that  due to the change in market conditions noted above  has become or is expected to become technologically obsolete 
accordingly  during the year ended december   we revised our classification of these assets to assets held for sale or disposal 
the fair value of these assets was determined using third party quotes or other estimates of salvage value  and the assets carrying value was written down to salvage value 
the new carrying value of the assets held for sale or disposal is approximately million  which is included in machinery and equipment in property  plant and equipment  net in the accompanying consolidated condensed balance sheet 
other income expense other expense  net increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in other expense  net was primarily due to a million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the recent refinancing of our long term debt  a decrease in foreign currency transaction and derivative gains of approximately million  and the absence of the million realized gain for the early settlement of a related party financing obligation related to the remaining interest in meadville aspocomp bvi holdings ltd  which occurred in these increased expenses were partially offset by a million realized gain on the sale of securities in total other expense  net increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in total other expense  net for the year ended december  was primarily due to interest expense related to the debt assumed at the date of acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  partially offset by a realized gain of million related to the early settlement of a related party financing obligation related to the remaining interest in meadville aspocomp bvi holdings ltd  as well as approximately million of foreign currency transaction gains 

table of contents income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the tax provision reductions were primarily due to lower pre tax income  exclusive of impairment charges  for which a tax benefit was not recorded 
our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate changed due to the impact of impairment charges in and  for which a tax benefit was not recorded 
our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the us federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  generally lower tax rates in china and hong kong  generation of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
certain foreign losses generated are not more than likely to be realizable  and thus no income tax benefit has been recognized on these losses 
additionally  as of december  and  we had net deferred income tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize the deferred income tax assets in future periods 
as of december  and  we also had full valuation allowances on certain foreign and united states deferred tax assets amounting to million and million  respectively  where we have determined that it is not more likely than not that the underlying deferred tax assets will be realized 
the provision for income taxes decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased in primarily due to the impairment of long lived assets  for which a tax benefit was not recorded  partially offset by an increase in total earnings generated in lower tax jurisdictions  which have a lower effective tax rate than our north america operations 
in addition  our tax rate benefited from research and development credits in our north america operations 
our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the us federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  tax rates in china and hong kong  generation of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
certain foreign losses generated are not more than likely to be realizable  and thus no income tax benefit has been recognized on these losses 
additionally  as of december  and  we had net deferred income tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
based on our forecast for future taxable earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize the deferred income tax assets in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and the issuance of term and revolving debt and convertible notes 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance capital expenditures  meet debt service requirements  fund working capital requirements and finance acquisitions 
we anticipate that servicing debt  financing capital expenditures  funding working capital requirements  and acquisitions will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million compared to million as of december  this increase in working capital is primarily attributable to proceeds from the refinancing of debt during the year ended december  as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  of which approximately million was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december   million was located in asia and million was located in european countries 
cash and cash equivalents located in our asia pacific operating segment are expected to remain for use in local operations 
cash and cash equivalents located in our backplane assembly facility in shanghai  china  as well as in europe  which are managed in conjunction with our us operations  are expected to be repatriated and will be subject to us income tax 
as of december   approximately million of cash and cash equivalents was located in our shanghai  china backplane assembly plant 
other than the cash and cash equivalents located in our shanghai backplane assembly and our european locations  we do not currently expect to repatriate earnings from our other foreign subsidiaries 
our capital expenditure plan is expected to total approximately million of which approximately million relates to our asia pacific operating segment 
it will fund capital equipment 
table of contents purchases to increase production capacity  especially for substrate and rigid flex pcb manufacturing  expand our technological capabilities  comply with increased environmental regulations and replace aging equipment 
during the year ended december   one of our majority owned foreign subsidiaries declared a dividend in the amount of approximately million  which includes million paid to its noncontrolling interest shareholder during the year ended december  based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  cash on hand and cash available from borrowings under our existing credit arrangements will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditure  debt service  working capital  and acquisition needs for the next months 
we believe that there is minimal risk of not being in compliance with our existing financial covenants so as to accelerate the maturity of the new credit agreement 
credit agreement we are party to a new facility agreement new credit agreement consisting of a million senior secured term loan  a million senior secured revolving loan and a secured million letters of credit facility 
the term loan and letters of credit facility will mature on september   and the revolving loan will mature on march  the new credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of our asia pacific operating segment and is senior to all our other debt  including the convertible notes 
we have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the full and punctual payment of all obligations of the asia pacific operating segment under the new credit agreement 
borrowings under the new credit agreement bear interest at a floating rate of libor term election by us plus an applicable interest margin 
borrowings bear interest at a rate of libor plus under the term loan and revolving loan 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the new credit agreement was 
borrowings under the new credit agreement are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include maintaining maximum total leverage ratios and minimum net worth  current assets  and interest coverage ratios for both us and our asia pacific operating segment 
in addition  our new credit agreement includes a covenant that the principal shareholders as defined in the shareholders agreement dated april  as amended on september  will not reduce their shareholding below percent of ttm s issued shares 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on any unused portion of the loans and letters of credit facility granted under the new credit agreement 
we incurred million for the year ended december  in commitment fees related to the unused portion of any loan or facility under the new credit agreement and the recently terminated credit agreement entered into on november  as of december   the term loan of million  which is included as long term debt  was outstanding  million of the revolver was outstanding  and million of letters of credit were outstanding 
available borrowing capacity under the revolving loan was million as of december  convertible notes in may  we issued million of convertible notes 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest is payable semiannually in arrears on may and november of each year 
the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally to our future unsecured senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness 
offering expenses are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes 
at any time prior to november   holders may convert their convertible notes into cash and  if applicable  into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment  under the following circumstances during any calendar quarter beginning after june  and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day of such preceding calendar quarter  during the five business day period after any consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each 
table of contents day of that consecutive trading day period is less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on such day  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described in the prospectus supplement related to the convertible notes  which can be found on the sec s website at www 
sec 
gov 
as of december   none of the conversion criteria had been met 
on or after november  until the close of business on the third scheduled trading day preceding the may  maturity of the convertible notes  holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
upon conversion  for each  principal amount of notes  we will pay cash for the lesser of the conversion value or  and shares of our common stock  if any  based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the applicable trading day observation period 
the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion  subject to certain conversion rate adjustments  would be approximately million shares 
we are not permitted to redeem the notes at any time prior to maturity 
in the event of a fundamental change or certain default events  as defined in the prospectus supplement  holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into a convertible note hedge and warrant transaction call spread transaction  with respect to our common stock 
this option expires on may  and can only be executed upon the conversion of the convertible notes 
additionally  we sold warrants for the option to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the call spread transaction has no effect on the terms of the convertible notes and reduces potential dilution by effectively increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes to per share of our common stock 
other letters of credit in addition to the letters of credit obtained pursuant to the new credit agreement  we maintain several unused letters of credit a million standby letter of credit expiring on december  associated with its insured workers compensation program  and two standby letters of credit in the amount of million in aggregate expiring on december  and february  related to the lease of two of its production facilities  and one other letter of credit in the amount of million related to purchases of machinery and equipment  which expired in february contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides information on our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt obligations convertible debt obligations interest on debt obligations interest rate swap liabilities foreign currency forward contract liabilities equipment payables purchase obligations operating lease commitments total contractual obligations unrecognized uncertain tax benefits of million are not included in the table above as we are not sure when the amount will be paid 

table of contents estimated environmental liabilities of million  not included in the table above  are accrued and recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
seasonality as a result of the product and customer mix of our asia pacific operating segment  a portion of our revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
these fluctuations include seasonal patterns in the computer and cellular phone industry  which together have become a significant portion of the end markets that we serve 
this seasonality typically results in higher net sales in the third and fourth quarters due to end customer demand for fourth quarter sales of consumer electronics products 
seasonal fluctuations also include the chinese new year holidays in the first quarter  which typically results in lower net sales 
in addition  our accounting calendar causes the first quarter of the fiscal year to have fewer days than the other quarters  especially the fourth quarter 
in some cases  the number of days can differ by as many as twelve days between the first and fourth quarters  which can cause significantly lower first quarter sales 
subsequent to december  we will modify our accounting calendar so that the first quarter ends on the monday closest to april and the last quarter always ends on december  reducing the difference in the number of days between the first and fourth quarters 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate as we expect that we generally will be able to continue to pass along component price increases to our customers 
severe increases in inflation  however  could affect the global and us economies and have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may not be able to pass along to our major customers significant increases in the costs of gold  copper and other commodities used in our products  which could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margins 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update that would require that an entity provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this update does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted the amendment on january   and our adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued an update to an accounting standard related to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  whereby an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived 
table of contents intangible asset is impaired 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   and early adoption is permitted 
we adopted the amendments in conjunction with our annual impairment test performed for fiscal year our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an update to an accounting standard related to testing goodwill for impairment whereby an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
we adopted the amendments on january   and our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an update to an accounting standard related to comprehensive income  whereby an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted 
we adopted the amendments on january   and our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business operations we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we have not experienced any losses to date on any derivative financial instruments due to counterparty credit risk 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward positions  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with their underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
interest rate risk our business is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
our interest expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of libor interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
increases in interest rates would increase interest expenses relating to the outstanding variable rate borrowings of certain foreign subsidiaries and increase the cost of debt 
fluctuations in interest rates can also lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of the debt obligations 
in conjunction with the november  credit agreement  we entered into a two year pay fixed  receive floating month libor  amortizing interest rate swap arrangement with an initial notional amount of million  for the period beginning april  and ending on april  the interest rate swap applied a fixed interest rate against the first interest payments of a portion of the million term loan related to the november  credit agreement  over the term of the interest rate swap 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases to zero over its term  consistent with our risk management objectives 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  we would pay a fixed rate of and would receive floating month libor during the swap period 
we had designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge  and during the years ended 
table of contents december  and  the interest rate swap increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
there was no impact to interest expense for the year ended december  as the interest rate swap did not hedge interest payments until the period beginning april  as of december   we no longer designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge as the borrowings attributable to this interest rate swap were paid in full during the year ended december  the notional value underlying the swap at december  was million 
as of december  and  the fair value of the swap was recorded as a liability of million in other accrued liabilities and million in other long term liabilities  respectively 
the change in the fair value of this interest rate swap is recorded as other  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   approximately of our long term debt was based on fixed rates  including notional amounts related to interest rate swaps 
based on our borrowings as of december   an assumed change in variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by million 
foreign currency risks we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the us dollar as a normal part of the reporting process 
our asia pacific operations utilize the chinese renminbi rmb and the hong kong dollar hkd as the functional currencies  which results in us recording a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
our foreign exchange exposure results primarily from employee related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries  foreign currency denominated purchases and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary foreign exchange exposure is to the rmb 
we do not generally engage in hedging to manage foreign currency risk related to revenue and expenses denominated in rmb and hkd nor do we currently use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to foreign currency risk for loans due from our foreign subsidiaries 
however  we may consider the use of derivatives in the future 
in general  our prc customers pay us in rmb  which partially mitigates this foreign currency exchange risk 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to reduce the volatility of purchases and other obligations generated in currencies other than the functional currencies 
our foreign subsidiaries may at times purchase forward exchange contracts to manage their foreign currency risks in relation to certain purchases of machinery denominated in foreign currencies other than our foreign functional currency 
the notional amount of the foreign exchange contracts at december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
we have designated certain of these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges
