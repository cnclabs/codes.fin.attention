established over years ago  the red lion brand is regionally recognized and is particularly well known in the western united states  where our hotels are located 
as of december   our hotel network was comprised of hotels located in nine states and one canadian province  with  rooms and  square feet of meeting space as provided below

red lion owned and leased hotels continuing operations discontinued operations red lion franchised hotels total we operate in three reportable segments the hotels segment derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage operations at our owned and leased hotels 
as of december   we operated hotels  of which are wholly owned and five are leased 
one of the owned hotels is classified as discontinued operations and not included in any reported hotel statistics from continuing operations 
the franchise segment is engaged primarily in licensing the red lion brands to franchisees 
this segment generates revenue from franchise fees that are typically based on a percent of room revenues and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brands and access to our central services programs 
these programs include our reservation system  guest loyalty program  national and regional sales  revenue management tools  quality inspections  advertising and brand standards 
as of december   we had franchised hotels operating under the red lion brands 
the entertainment segment derives revenues from promotion and presentation of entertainment productions under the operations of westcoast entertainment  and from ticketing services under the operations of ticketswest 
the ticketing service business offers ticketing inventory management systems  call center services  and outlet electronic channel distribution for event locations 
our remaining activities  none of which constitutes a reportable segment  have been aggregated into other 
results of operations our reported numbers for the periods presented in this report reflect results of the seattle property for the full years prior to but not the full year of  as the sale of that property closed on june  in addition  our reported numbers for the periods presented reflect the results of the helena property through july   when the sale of that property closed and reflect the results of the denver southeast property through october   when the sale of that property closed 
these properties were reported in continuing operations since we have significant continuing involvement in the operations of these properties that now operate as franchised hotels 
in order to help investors distinguish changes from results of continuing operations versus changes due to the sales of these hotel properties  we will discuss operating results from continuing operations as reported and also discuss certain operating results and data for periods included in the report on a comparable hotel basis 
comparable hotels are properties that are owned or leased by us for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared 
therefore  the seattle  helena and denver southeast properties are excluded from the comparable owned and leased hotel statistics and operating results 
during the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million or per share 
included in the continuing operations for the year ended december  is an aggregate of million in non cash  pre tax impairment charges on the missoula  helena  pendleton and denver southeast properties 
the net loss also includes non cash  pre tax impairment charges of million on the medford and kalispell mall properties and the red lion hotel sacramento sacramento property which are included in discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   our net loss was million or per share  which includes non cash  pre tax goodwill and asset impairment charges in continuing operations of million and million respectively and a million pre tax gain on the sale of the seattle property 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying amount of the hotel reporting unit exceeded its fair value  which was estimated based on a combined income and market approach 
accordingly  a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized in the hotel reporting unit 
the goodwill did not have any tax basis  which resulted in a permanent difference between book and tax income and the unusual situation of having income tax expense for the year on a book loss 
the pre tax impairment charges to continuing operations were on the missoula  helena  denver southeast and vancouver properties 
the helena and denver southeast properties were listed for sale and subsequently sold in and were written down to their estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 
the missoula property was listed for sale in  was not sold in and was written down to its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 
the vancouver property is subject to a right of way acquisition by the state to build a replacement bridge  and we have determined the carrying

the net loss in also includes a million pre tax asset impairment charge in discontinued operations related to the medford property 
during  we reported a net loss of million or per share  which includes  in discontinued operations  a pre tax impairment charge of million related to the termination of a franchise and sublease agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we agreed to terminate the franchise and sublease agreement with the operator of the sacramento property 
we subsequently entered into an agreement with a new franchisee and subtenant 
as a result of the original contract termination  we recognized an impairment charge of million 
we also recognized a net credit adjustment of million reflecting the recognition of deferred sublease income of million partially offset by million in expenses associated with uncollectible accounts and accrued expenses of the former subtenant  included in continuing operations 
also included in the net loss is million of expense related to the separation of our former president and chief executive officer

see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
hotel facility and land lease costs declined million to million in compared to primarily resulting from the acquisition from istar financial in november of a number of properties that we previously leased 
during  we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million in continuing operations related to our missoula  denver southeast  helena and pendleton properties  which were classified as assets held for sale in the carrying values of these properties were adjusted to their estimated fair value less costs to sell based upon the listing prices or other evidence of their estimated fair value 
net gain on asset dispositions decreased by million in compared to because the prior year included a million gain on the sale of our seattle property 
we did not have a similar gain in undistributed corporate expenses increased by million in compared to the increase primarily relates to higher directors and officers insurance premiums and higher investor relations costs 
undistributed corporate expenses include general and administrative charges such as corporate payroll  stock compensation expense  director fees  legal expenses  charitable contributions  director and officers insurance  bank service charges and outside accountants and various other consultants expense 
we consider these expenses to be undistributed because the costs are not directly related to our business segments and therefore are not further distributed 
however  costs that can be identified with a particular segment  such as accounting  human resources and information technology  are distributed and included in direct expenses of the segments to which they are allocated 
compared to direct hotel expenses as reported were million in compared to million in the sale of the seattle property is the primary driver of the overall decline in hotel expenses because only a partial year of expenses was incurred in compared to a full year of expenses in on a comparable basis  direct hotel expenses were million compared to million  representing a increase 
rooms related expenses increased million or driven by occupancy related costs  primarily labor  promotional and reservation costs 
we also incurred additional expense related to sales  marketing  maintenance and energy costs during on a comparable basis  the segment recorded direct margin in of compared to in direct costs from the franchise segment increased million in from primarily reflecting additional costs associated with the former subtenant and franchisee of our sacramento property 
entertainment direct costs increased million  or  reflecting the impact of the costs associated with the successful production during of the broadway play wicked 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense declined by million in compared to the primary drivers of the decline were the sale of the seattle property in june and also the marketing of four additional properties for sale during the year 
when these properties were classified as assets held for sale  we ceased recording depreciation on them as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
hotel facility and land lease costs decreased million to million in compared to million in the primary driver of the decline was savings of approximately million in the last two months of resulting from the acquisition from istar financial in november of a number of properties that we previously leased 
this benefit was partially offset by a lease renewal at our property in anaheim  california at a contractually higher rate 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
during our annual impairment testing  we determined the carrying amount of the hotel reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized in the hotel reporting unit to impair all of the remaining goodwill associated with the hotel reporting unit 
also during  we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million 
of that amount  million relates to our missoula property  million relates to our helena property  million relates to our denver southeast property and million relates to our vancouver property 
the helena and denver southeast properties were both listed for sale and subsequently sold in and were adjusted to their estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 
the missoula property was listed for sale in  was not sold in and was written down to its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 
the vancouver property is subject to a right of way acquisition by the state in order to build a replacement of a bridge  and we have determined the carrying value is not recoverable 
in  the net gain on asset dispositions reflects the gain recognized on the sale of our seattle property in the amount of million 
additionally  this line includes the ongoing recognition of deferred gains on a previously sold hotel for which we entered into a long term lease arrangement  offset by asset disposition losses throughout the year 
undistributed corporate expenses decreased by million in compared to the prior year included million in executive severance cost 
undistributed corporate expenses include general and administrative charges such as corporate payroll  legal expenses  director and officers insurance  bank service charges  outside accountants and various other expenses 
we consider these expenses to be undistributed because the costs are not directly related to our business segments and therefore are not further distributed 
however  costs that can be identified to a particular segment are distributed  such as accounting  human resources and information technology  and are included in direct expenses of the segments to which they are allocated 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million compared to million recorded in the decline is primarily attributable to a decline in the principal amount of debt outstanding in our average pre tax interest rate on debt during was compared to in interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million compared to million recorded in the decline is primarily attributable to a decline in the principal amount of debt outstanding in our average pre tax interest rate on debt during was compared to in income taxes our effective income tax rate with respect to income from continuing operations for was as compared to  and for and  respectively 
the variance in our rate is due primarily to the impairment of million of book basis goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes 
other items giving rise to a difference between our statutory us federal tax rate of and our effective rate include state taxes and incentive tax credits allowed under federal law 
we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense or benefit for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which typically arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  and in the determination of tax credits and other items that impact our income tax expense or benefit 
based on our current assessment of future taxable income  including scheduling of the reversal of our taxable temporary differences  we anticipate that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our recorded deferred tax assets  and therefore we did not record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december  
table of contents discontinued operations during the year ended december   we concluded that we did not intend to maintain continuing involvement with our retail shopping center in kalispell  montana which was listed for sale 
additionally  we determined that we would not have continuing involvement in certain real estate ownership in sacramento  california 
accordingly  the results of these operations have been classified as discontinued operations in our statements of operations for all periods presented 
during the year ended december   we concluded that we did not intend to maintain continuing involvement with our hotel listed for sale located in medford  oregon 
accordingly  the operations of this hotel have been classified as discontinued operations in our statements of operations for all years presented 
for the year ended december   we concluded that a leased hotel in astoria  oregon had reached the end of its useful life and the hotel was closed 
accordingly  the operations of that hotel have been classified as discontinued operations for all years presented

liquidity and capital resources at december   we had total long term debt due within one year of million 
this includes a million term loan under our wells fargo credit facility that matures on june   and other debt with a balance of million maturing on july  our current liabilities at december  exceeded our current assets  excluding assets held for sale  by million 
as discussed further below  we are actively pursuing financing alternatives to address maturing indebtedness and to supplement working capital 
we have up to million of revolving credit available under our current wells fargo facility  subject to certain financial covenants 
we had no amounts drawn on the revolving line at either december  or the date of filing for this form k 
we continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants  to generate positive cash flow from operations and to have adequate liquidity to fund our ongoing operating activities  however there can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debts when they mature or to invest in our hotels to remain competitive at our current rates 
principal payments of million are required on the wells fargo term loan on the last day of each calendar quarter or the first business day thereafter 
additional principal payments will be required if a property securing the loan is sold or we raise new equity 
in the case of a property sale  the additional payment required will be the greater of i of the net proceeds from the sale or ii of the appraised market value of the property that is sold 
in the case of an equity issuance  the additional payment required will be of the net offering proceeds 
the maturity of the credit facility was recently extended by three months  so all remaining unpaid amounts on the term loan and the revolving line of credit are now due on june  interest during under the term loan and revolving line of credit was payable at our option i at a fluctuating rate above a base rate in effect from time to time  or ii at a rate above libor under one  three or six month terms

during the year ended december   three hotel properties located in sacramento  california  helena  montana  and aurora  colorado that were included as collateral for the credit facility were sold and we made additional required payments of million in aggregate 
the credit facility requires us to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants  as well as financial covenants relating to leverage and to debt service coverage ratios 
it also includes customary events of default 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  we are committed to keeping our properties well maintained and attractive to our customers in order to enhance our competitiveness within the industry and keep our hotels in the midscale category 
this requires ongoing access to capital for replacement of outdated furnishings as well as for facility repair  modernization and renovation 
over the last four to five years  our levels of capital expenditures for these purposes have been lower than normal due to the general economic conditions impacting our industry 
as a result  we will be required over the next months to invest significant amounts in hotel renovations  updates and maintenance in order to support the room rates that we have historically charged 
we have announced a listing for sale or the intent to sell some of our real estate assets 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail

we cannot assure that such funds  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
if we sell additional assets  these sales may result in future impairments or losses on the final sale 
furthermore  current assets held for sale may have future impairments related to the marketing process or final sale

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million  a million increase from net cash provided by operating activities of million during and a million decrease from million net cash provided in the primary drivers of the increase from are favorable timing of accounts payable payments and the timing of accrued payroll based upon the pay dates in in addition to the timing of our liabilities we have seen an increase in accounts receivable collection and the use of restricted cash for payments of capital purchases for our cmbs debt properties

inflation the effect of inflation  as measured by fluctuations in the us consumer price index  has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
table of contents the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we consider a critical accounting policy to be one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements  however  we have also identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates below 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
revenue recognition and receivables revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
when we receive payment from customers before our services have been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the service has been completed 
we recognize revenue from the following sources hotels room rental and food and beverage sales from owned and leased hotels 
revenues are recognized when our services have been performed  generally at the time of the hotel stay or guest visit to the restaurant 
this treatment is consistent with others within our industry 
our revenues are significantly impacted by global  national and regional economic conditions affecting the travel and hospitality industry  as well as the relative market share of our hotels compared with our competitors 
franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of our brand names 
franchise revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the franchise agreements 
entertainment computerized event ticketing services and promotion of broadway style shows and other special events 
where we act as an agent and receive a net fee or commission  it is recognized as revenue in the period the services are performed 
when we are the promoter of an event and are at risk for the production  revenues and expenses are recorded in the period of the event performance 
we review the ability to collect individual accounts receivable on a routine basis 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
a receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection attempts fail 
long lived assets property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make judgments regarding estimated future cash flows from the respective properties  which is dependent upon internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which our cash flows will occur  the determination of real estate market values  asset appraisals and  if available and appropriate  current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers or net sales proceeds from previous  comparable transactions 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings as an asset impairment 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
changes to our plans  including a decision to sell  dispose of or change the intended use of an asset  could have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset 
to determine estimated fair value  we use level inputs for our discounted cash flow analyses 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available  thereby allowing for situations in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date 
level inputs used include growth rate  property level pro forma financial information and remaining lives of the assets 
management bases these assumptions on historical data and experience and future operational expectations 
for certain assets  we use recent asset appraisals or valuations performed by third parties  which we deemed to be level inputs  to support our estimate of fair value 

table of contents intangible assets our intangible assets include brands and goodwill  which we do not amortize 
instead  we test for impairment annually or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  subject to the same general assumptions discussed above for long lived assets 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts fair value measurement through our company estimated weighted average cost of capital used to determine discount rate  and through our common stock price that is used to determine market capitalization 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term move or a longer term trend 
our other intangible assets include marketing and lease contracts  the values of which are amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average life of the agreements 
new and future accounting pronouncements adopted accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu
