on october   dss entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with lexington technology group inc  lexington pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of dss will merge with and into lexington  with lexington surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of dss merger 
defined terms contained in the descriptions of the merger which follow shall have the meanings described to them in the merger agreement  filed with the securities and exchange commission on october  assuming the merger had been completed on december   the following aggregate number of dss securities would have been issued in the merger to the holders of lexington common stock and preferred stock  shares of dss common stock   shares of dss common stock to be held in escrow  up to  shares of dss common stock if lexington s cash balance exceeds million to a maximum of million at the effective time of the merger  up to  warrants with an exercise price of per share that are exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of dss common stock  additional shares of dss convertible preferred stock  or warrants with an exercise price of 
per share if the proposal to authorize dss preferred stock is not approved by dss stockholders  to any lexington preferred stockholder that would beneficially own more than of dss common stock as a result of this merger  and for lexington option holders only   options to purchase dss common stock in exchange for their options to purchase  shares of lexington common stock 
lexington is a private intellectual property monetization company that recently acquired a patent portfolio of six patents and four pending patent applications relating to technology invented by thomas bascom the bascom portfolio 
lexington is focused on the economic benefits of intellectual property assets through acquiring or internally developing patents or other intellectual property assets or interests therein and then monetizing such assets through a variety of value enhancing initiatives  including  but not limited to licensing  customized technology solutions such as applications for medical electronic health records  strategic partnerships  and litigation 
on october   lexington  through its wholly owned subsidiary  bascom research  initiated patent infringement lawsuits in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia against five companies  including facebook  inc and linkedin corporation  for unlawfully using systems that incorporate features claimed in patents owned by bascom research 
the patents in suit relate to the data structure used by social and business networking web sites and web corporate intranets 
starting on december   the lawsuits were transferred to the united states district court in the northern district of california 
immediately following the completion of the merger  the former stockholders of lexington are expected to own approximately of the outstanding common and preferred stock if approved  or 
warrants of the combined company on a fully diluted basis including options and warrants without taking into effect the beneficial ownership condition and the current stockholders of dss are expected to own approximately of the outstanding common stock and preferred stock of the combined company 
these calculations exclude dss common stock held by lexington s stockholders prior to the completion of the merger 
these percentages of ownership include the  shares held in escrow  which are eligible to be voted while in escrow 
if the escrow shares are terminated which will be determined one year after the effective date  lexington shareholders would own a  with dss shareholders owning on a fully diluted basis including options and warrants without taking into effect the beneficial ownership condition 
we have expended significant effort and management attention on the proposed merger transaction 
there is no assurance that the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement will be consummated 
if the merger transaction is not consummated for any reason  our business and operations  as well as the market price of our stock and warrants may be adversely affected 
for accounting purposes  based on our preliminary assessment  lexington was identified as the acquirer  as it is defined in fasb topic asc as a result  in the post combination consolidated financial statements  lexington s assets and liabilities will be presented at its pre combination amounts  and our assets and liabilities will be recognized and measured in accordance with the guidance for business combinations in asc however  the assumptions used for this assessment may change which could result in dss being identified as the accounting acquirer on date of the merger 
the company has filed a form s registration statement with the sec regarding the proposed merger 
the merger requires approval by the stockholders of both lexington and dss  and if approved  we currently estimate that the merger will close sometime during the first half of results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and revenue year ended year ended december  december  change revenue printing   packaging   plastic ids and cards   licensing and digital solutions   total revenue   revenue for the year ended december   revenue was approximately million  an increase of from the year ended december  the revenue increase was primarily due to a significant increase in the company s packaging sales which benefitted from increased order activity from its largest customers during the year 
in addition  the company s licensing and digital solutions saw a increase in revenue in  as compared with  which was primarily the result of the company s acquisition of extradev in may of the company s printing revenues decreased during the year as the company reduced its outbound sales efforts on certain lower margin commercial printing projects to focus its efforts on security printing which are generally at higher margins 
the company s plastic division s revenues increased as it saw increases in sales of its rfid and other smart card offerings offset by a reduction in it driver s license sales as one driver s license project the company had in did not recur in gross profit year ended year ended december  december  change costs of revenue printing   packaging   plastic ids and cards   licensing and digital solutions   total cost of revenue   gross profit printing   packaging   plastic ids and cards   licensing and digital solutions   total gross profit   gross profit percentage gross profit costs of revenue increased in as compared to compared to a increase in the company s revenue over the same period 
as a result  gross profit increased during  as compared to the company saw a significant increase in gross profits from its printing group as it benefited from a lower cost structure and a more favorable product mix 
in addition  each of the company s packaging and plastics groups realized gross profit gains as a result of their increases in revenue 
gross profits from licensing and digital solutions sales increased in  as compared with  primarily due to the addition of gross profits from the company s acquisition of extradev  which occurred in may operating expenses year ended year ended december  december  change operating expenses sales  general and administrative compensation  professional fees   sales and marketing   rent and utilities   other   other operating expenses non production depreciation and amortization   research and development  including research and development costs paid by equity instruments   stock based compensation   amortization of intangibles   total operating expenses   sales  general and administrative compensation costs  excluding stock based compensation  increased in as compared to primarily due to the addition of employees as a result of the company s acquisition of its cloud computing division in may  offset by reductions of personnel in the company s printing and packaging divisions 
professional fees increased in from due to an increase in intellectual property consulting and investor relations costs  and approximately  of legal  accounting and consulting fees incurred during the third and fourth quarters of in connection with the company s proposed merger with lexington 
sales and marketing decreased during compared to  as the company significantly decreased its marketing costs  including costs incurred during to redesign the company s logo  websites  sales collateral and trade show booths  which did not re occur in rent and utilities expenses in decreased due to the elimination of rent at the company s packaging division as a result of that division s purchase of its facility in august  offset by an increase in rent due to the company s acquisition of extradev in may other expenses consist primarily of equipment maintenance and repairs  office supplies  it support  bad debt expense and commercial liability and director and officer liability insurance costs 
other expenses for increased and included a one time placement agent fee related to the placement of a convertible note and subsequent conversion in march research and development costs consist primarily of compensation costs for research personnel  third party research costs  and consulting costs 
during  the company s research and development costs increased primarily due to payments and stock based compensation costs for warrants issued to ipcapital group  inc  a third party consulting firm assisting the company with its goal of increasing its intellectual property portfolio of patents and trade secrets in the security field 
stock based compensation includes expense charges for all stock based awards to employees  directors and consultants  except for stock based compensation allocated to research and development 
such awards include option grants  warrant grants  and restricted stock awards 
stock based compensation for increased as compared with  primarily due to the estimated value of warrants issued in february to the company s investor relations provider and warrants issued to a consultant in july  along with the estimated value of options issued to certain of the company s senior management and board that will vest upon the company s merger with lexington  which the company deems is more likely than not to occur during the second quarter of amortization of intangibles increased in compared to are due to the increase in the company s other intangible asset basis due to the acquisition of extradev in may other income and expenses year ended year ended december  december  change other income expense change in fair value of derivative liability  interest expense   amortizaton of note discount  other income expense  net   change in fair value of derivative liability in late  the company issued various financial instruments to an investor in connection with a stock purchase agreement  which contained certain provisions that resulted in a derivative liability 
on february  the company entered into certain amendments with the investor for the purpose of modifying the terms of the financial instruments that among other things eliminated the provisions of the warrants and later investment that had created the derivative liabilities 
as a result  the company determined the fair value of the derivative liability as of the modification date of february  and recorded the change in fair value of the derivative liability since december  of  in the statement of operations 
interest expense during  interest expense decreased generally as the result of the decrease in debt carried by the company s packaging division as compared to amortization of note discount on february   the company entered into a convertible note 
the holder of the note had the right to convert the principal and any interest due under the note into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in conjunction with this conversion option  the company recorded a beneficial conversion feature of approximately  which the company was to expense over the term of the note 
in march  the holder exercised the conversion option on the note 
pursuant to the conversion  the company issued an aggregate of  shares of its common stock to the holder for full payment of note and accrued interest 
in conjunction with the conversion  the company recorded a note discount amortization expense of the entire  of remaining unamortized debt discount expense during the first quarter of income taxes year ended december  year ended december  change income tax expense benefit  net   in  the company recognized a  deferred tax benefit during as a result of its acquisition of extradev a temporary difference between the book fair value and tax basis for the equipment and other intangible assets acquired was created resulting in a deferred tax liability and additional goodwill 
with the increase in deferred tax liability the company reduced the deferred tax asset valuation account and recognized a deferred tax benefit 
net loss and loss per share year ended year ended december  december  change net loss   net loss per share  basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding  basic and diluted   in  the company had a net loss of  which represented a increase from the net loss of  in the increase in net loss was primarily due to three items  of immediate amortization of note discount expense recorded in the first quarter of  a  one time other income recorded in the first quarter of due to a change in the fair value of a derivative liability that did not re occur in  and approximately  of legal  accounting and consulting expenses related to potential merger with lexington 
these three items in aggregate amounted to  absent these items  net loss during would have decreased approximately 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically met its liquidity and capital requirements primarily through the private placement of equity securities and debt financings 
as of december   the company had cash of approximately million 
in addition  the company had approximately  available to its packaging and digital divisions under revolving credit lines  net of sweep account 
the company believes that its current cash resources and credit line resources provide it sufficient resources in order to fund its operations and meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months 
during  the company increased its cash position and reduced its debt by selling shares of its common stock and issuing shares of its common stock pursuant to debt conversions and warrant exercises 
on february   the company sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately  in a private placement of equity 
on february   the company entered into an agreement whereby an existing commercial term note in the original principal amount of  was sold and transferred to an investor for a purchase price of  the outstanding principal at the time of the sale 
in connection with the sale and transfer of the commercial term note  the company agreed to structure the note as a convertible note at a conversion price of per share 
in march  the holder converted the full amount of the remaining indebtedness under the note  in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock  and the note was retired 
during  the company received cash proceeds of approximately  from the exercise of warrants 
in addition  in october  the company sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately  in a private placement of equity 
operating cash flow during  the company used approximately  of cash for operations  a increase from the company s use of cash for operations during  which generally reflect the increase in net loss caused by the approximately  of professional fees incurred by the company during related to its pending merger with lexington  along with a difference in the timing of cash flows from accounts receivables between and  which resulted in an approximately  decrease in operating cash flow in investing cash flow during  the company used approximately  on equipment additions across all of its divisions  and approximately  of legal and consulting costs which were capitalized as patent assets 
financing cash flows during  the company raised approximately million from the sale of equity in two private placements  as described above  and from the exercise of warrants made by certain holders 
in addition  the company made scheduled debt and capitalized lease payments during of approximately  and paid down the balance of its packaging division s revolving line of credit by approximately  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  an effect on our financial condition  financial statements  revenues or expenses 
inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during or as we are generally able to pass the increase in our material and labor costs to our customers  or absorb them as we improve the efficiency of our operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  goodwill impairments  inventory allowances  revenue recognition  stock based compensation valuations  the valuation of intangible assets  and allocation of assets in business combinations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost 
depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of five to thirty nine years using the straight line depreciation method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term 
intangible assets consist primarily of royalty rights  contractual rights  customer list  and patent acquisition  application and defense costs 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of five to twenty years using the straight line depreciation method 
for patent related assets  the remaining legal life of the patent is used as the estimate useful life unless circumstances determine that the useful life will be less than the legal life 
long lived assets to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets based on estimated future cash flows from and the estimated fair value of such long lived assets  and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicated the carrying amount may be impaired 
asc topic provides an entity with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if the two step impairment test is necessary  a fair value based test is applied at the reporting unit level  which is generally one level below the operating segment level 
the test compares the fair value of an entity reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
this test requires various judgments and estimates 
the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using a market approach in combination with a discounted operating cash flow approach 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
an adjustment to goodwill will be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually in conjunction with preparation of its annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the company performed the annual assessment and has determined that no impairment is necessary during the years ended december  and other intangible assets other intangible assets consists of costs associated with the application  and acquisition of the company s patents and contractual rights to patents and trade secrets associated with the company s technologies  a non exclusive licensing agreement  and customer lists obtained as a result of acquisitions 
the company s patents and trade secrets are for document anti counterfeiting and anti scanning technologies and processes that form the basis of the company s document security business 
patent application costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the patent  which generally approximates its legal life 
the company amortizes its other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
patents are amortized over the remaining legal life  up to years 
intangible asset amortization expense is generally classified as an operating expense 
the company believes that the decision to incur patent costs is discretionary as the associated products or services can be sold prior to or during the application process 
the company accounts for other intangible amortization as an operating expense  unless the underlying asset is directly associated with the production or delivery of a product 
to date  the amount of related amortization expense for other intangible assets directly attributable to revenue recognized is not material 
conventional convertible debt when the convertible feature of the conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value  this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature bcf 
prior to the determination of the bcf  the proceeds from the debt instrument were first allocated between the convertible debt and any embedded or detachable free standing instruments that are included  such as common stock warrants 
we record a bcf as a debt discount pursuant to fasb asc topic in those circumstances  the convertible debt will be recorded net of the discount related to the bcf 
we amortize the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method 
revenue recognition sales of security and commercial printing products  packaging  and plastic cards are recognized when a product or service is delivered  shipped or provided to the customer and all material conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed 
the company recognizes revenue from printing technology licenses once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the right and ability to use the product or technology has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
for digital solutions sales  revenue is recognized in accordance with the fasb asc accordingly  revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service or product has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and the collection of our fees is reasonably assured 
we recognize cloud computing revenue  including data backup  recovery and security services  on a monthly basis  beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services 
professional services are recognized in the period services are provided 
business combinations business combinations and non controlling interests are recorded in accordance with the business combination topic of the fasb asc 
under the guidance  the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values is recorded as goodwill 
if the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds the purchase price and the liabilities assumed then a gain on acquisition is recorded 
under the guidance  all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset 
the application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
share based payments we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for which awards are expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes merton model requires the use of subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services the company determines the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendor s performance is complete 
in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants  the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the black scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table for the years ended december volatility expected option term years years risk free interest rate expected forfeiture rate expected dividend yield income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
fasb asc requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets on an annual basis and a valuation allowance is provided or released  as necessary 
since the company has cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggest that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
as a result  as of the years ended december  and  the company has elected to record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to zero 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provisions benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value measurement topic of the fasb asc establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions  such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the immediate or short term maturity of these financial instruments 
the fair value of revolving credit lines  notes payable and long term debt approximates their carrying value as the stated or discounted rates of the debt reflect recent market conditions 
derivative instruments are recorded as assets and liabilities at estimated fair value based on available market information 
derivative instruments the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate swap contracts to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility 
the company has two interest rate swaps that change variable rates into fixed rates on two term loans 
these swaps qualify as level fair value financial instruments 
these swap agreements are not held for trading purposes and the company does not intend to sell the derivative swap financial instruments 
the company records the interest swap agreements on the balance sheet at fair value because the agreements qualify as a cash flow hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings 
when the hedged item is realized  gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci to the consolidated statement of operations on the same line item as the underlying transaction 
the valuations of the interest rate swaps have been derived from proprietary models of the bank based upon recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions and may reflect certain other financial factors such as anticipated profit or hedging  transactional  and other costs 
the notional amounts of the swaps decrease over the life of the agreements 
the company is exposed to a credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to the interest rate swap agreements 
however  the company does not anticipate non performance by the counter parties 
the cumulative net loss attributable to this cash flow hedge recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and other liabilities at december   was approximately   december  
the company has notional amounts of approximately  as of december  on its interest rate swap agreements for its citizens bank debt 
the company has two interest rate swaps that change variable rates into fixed rates on two term loans and the terms of these instruments are as follows notional amount variable rate fixed cost maturity date  february   august  the company accounts for warrants and other rights to acquire capital stock with exercise price reset features  or down round provisions  as derivative liabilities 
similarly  down round provisions for issuances of common stock are also accounted for as derivative liabilities 
these derivative liabilities are measured at fair value with the changes in fair value at the end of each period reflected in current period income or loss 
the fair value of derivative liabilities is estimated using a binomial model or monte carlo simulation to model the financial characteristics  depending on the complexity of the derivative being measured 
a monte carlo simulation provides a more accurate valuation than standard option valuation methodologies such as the black scholes merton binomial option models when derivatives include changing exercise prices or different alternatives depending on average future price targets 
in computing the fair value of the derivatives  the company uses significant judgments  which  if incorrect  could have a significant negative impact to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the input values for determining the fair value of the derivatives include observable market indices such as interest rates  and equity indices as well as unobservable model specific input values such as certain volatility parameters 
future changes in the fair value of the derivatives liabilities  if any  will be recorded in the statement of operations as gains or losses from derivative liabilities 
the derivative liability resulting from the warrant and later investment is classified as a level measurement 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu  technical corrections and improvements 
this asu makes certain incremental improvements to us gaap  including  among other revisions  conforming amendments that identify when the use of fair value should be linked to the definition of fair value in asc the majority of the amendments in asu were effective upon issuance on october  for both public entities and nonpublic entities 
for public entities  the more substantive amendments that are subject to transition guidance are effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this asu requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
public companies are required to comply with the requirements of asu for all reporting periods interim and annual beginning after december  currently  the adoption of this standard will only impact the change in the company s interest rate swap  and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
