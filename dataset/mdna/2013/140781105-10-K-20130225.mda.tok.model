item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview carbo ceramics inc generates revenue primarily through the sale of products and services to the oil and gas industry 
the company s principal business consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant and resin coated sand for use primarily in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
falcon technologies  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  uses proprietary technology to provide products that are designed to enable its clients to extend the life of their storage assets  reduce the potential for hydrocarbon spills and provide containment of stored materials 
the company also provides the industry s most popular hydraulic fracture simulation software fracpro  as well as hydraulic fracture design and consulting 
during  the company began production of resin coated ceramic carbobond lite and resin coated sand carbobond rcs proppants 
the introduction of carbobond lite addresses a market in which oil and natural gas wells are subject to a high risk of proppant flow back 
the adhesive property of the resin allows the ceramic proppant pack to adhere in place and therefore reduce the risk of proppant flow back 
in the case of carbobond rcs  the company made the strategic decision to offer a lower cost  lower conductivity alternative to its ceramic proppants thereby broadening its proppant suite of products 
management of the company believes that this is a natural extension of its core business and enhances the company s highly conductive proppant offering 
the company s products and services help oil and gas producers increase production and recovery rates from their wells  thereby lowering overall reservoir development costs 
as a result  the company s business is dependent to a large extent on the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
although the company s ceramic proppants are more expensive than alternative non ceramic proppants  the company has been able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products to numerous operators of oil and gas wells through increased technical marketing activity 
the company believes its future prospects benefit from both an increase in drilling activity worldwide and the desire of industry participants to improve production results and lower their overall development costs 
the company believes international sales will continue to represent an important role in its business 
international revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
management believes the addition of new manufacturing capacity is critical to the company s ability to continue its long term growth in sales volume and revenue for ceramic proppant  resin coated ceramic proppant and resin coated sand 
in regards to expansion  the company has been issued an air quality permit for its proposed ceramic proppant manufacturing plant in millen  georgia 
the company is moving forward with site work and construction of the first million pound line and anticipates the millen plant could commence operations near the end of the first quarter of upon the completion of the first line  the company s total ceramic proppant stated capacity is expected to be billion pounds per year 
a second resin coating production line in new iberia  louisiana was completed during  bringing the company s total resin coating capacity to million pounds per year 
also during  the company began to utilize its own carbo northern white sand in its sand processing facility in marshfield  wisconsin 
construction of a resin coating facility at this same site in marshfield has been deferred at this time 
the company will consider resuming construction when warranted by market conditions 
although the company has operated near or at full capacity at times during the previous ten years  the addition of significant new capacity  as well as the addition of resin coating capacity  could adversely impact operating profit margins if the timing of this new capacity does not match increases in demand for the company s products 
in addition  the ability to construct new capacity will be contingent upon the receipt of all needed environmental emission permits 
see item business and item a risk factors 
operating profit margin for the company s ceramic proppant business is principally impacted by manufacturing and distribution costs  sales price and the company s production levels as a percentage of its capacity 
although most direct production expenses have been relatively stable or predictable over time  the company has experienced volatility in the cost of natural gas  which is used in production by the company s 
table of contents domestic manufacturing facilities  and bauxite  which is the primary raw material for production of the company s high strength ceramic proppant 
the cost of natural gas has been a significant component of total monthly domestic direct production expense over the last four years 
in an effort to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas purchases and reduce exposure to short term spikes in the price of this commodity  the company contracts in advance for portions of its future natural gas requirements 
despite the efforts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices  it is possible that  given the significant portion of manufacturing costs represented by this item  gross margins as a percentage of sales may decline and changes in net income may not directly correlate to changes in revenue 
investments continue to be made to enhance the company s distribution capabilities 
the company recently completed an expansion of its distribution center in south texas 
the company is targeting the completion of an additional distribution center in the bakken region in the second half of with regard to resin coating and sand operations  during the company completed a second resin coating line at its new iberia  louisiana facility and began to utilize its northern white sand in its sand processing facility in marshfield  wisconsin 
the production of resin coated sand is a different process than the manufacture of ceramic proppant  and profit margins associated with resin coated sand are not as high as those historically received for the company s manufactured ceramic proppant 
as the company has expanded its operations in both domestic and international markets  there has been an increase in activities and expenses related to marketing  research and development  and finance and administration 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in recent years 
in the future  the company expects to continue to actively pursue new business opportunities by increasing marketing activities globally  and focusing on new product development 
the company expects that these activities will generate increased revenue 
as such  selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in from levels as the company pursues these opportunities and continues to expand its operations 
general business conditions the company s proppant business is impacted by the number of natural gas and oil wells drilled in north america  and the need to hydraulically fracture these wells 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are also influenced by the overall level of drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant is based on comparing the higher initial costs to the future value derived from increased production and recovery rates  the company s business is influenced by the current and expected prices of natural gas and oil 
during the second half of  the north american drilling rig count improved from the lows experienced during the second half of and stabilized during late in  a severe decline in natural gas prices led certain customers to reduce drilling activities and capital spending in natural gas basins and increase these items in liquids rich basins 
low natural gas prices continued throughout and operations were impacted by the shift in drilling activity away from natural gas basins 
the impact resulting from this shift included higher distribution costs due to the logistical challenges in these infrastructure limited regions and competitive pricing pressures resulting from an over supply of chinese ceramic proppant 
while natural gas fundamentals remain weak  the continued strength in oilfield activity by the company s clients in oily  liquids rich plays is encouraging 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

table of contents revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer generally upon delivery of products or at the time services are performed 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to two major customers  both of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in trade accounts receivable was attributable to those two customers 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of collectability risk and periodically evaluates the allowance based on a review of trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are periodically reviewed for collectability based on customers past credit history and current financial condition  and the allowance is adjusted  if necessary 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  the company s estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount and the allowance for doubtful accounts could be increased by a material amount 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million 
the company values inventory using the weighted average cost method 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to market value  as necessary 
future changes in demand and market conditions could cause the company to be exposed to additional obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  lower of cost or market adjustments may be required 
income taxes are provided for in accordance with asc topic  income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
long lived assets  which include net property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangibles and other long term assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying values of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period
