item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion is intended to provide insight into the financial condition and results of operations of united and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
operating earnings loss and operating earnings loss per diluted share are non gaap performance measures 
united s management believes that operating performance measures are useful in analyzing the company s financial performance trends since they exclude items that are non recurring in nature and therefore most of the discussion in this section will refer to operating performance measures 
a reconciliation of these operating performance measures to gaap performance measures is included in the table on pages and while united continues to experience challenges in its loan portfolio caused by the weakened housing and commercial real estate markets  the company s financial condition improved considerably in united was able to experience loan growth  despite the fragile economic conditions in its markets and intense competition for quality loans 
united reported net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in  which primarily reflected the credit losses taken in the first quarter associated with the execution of a plan to sell approximately million in substandard and nonperforming loans  and to accelerate the disposition of approximately million in foreclosed properties the problem asset disposition plan 
diluted earnings per common share was 
for the year ended december   compared with a diluted loss per common share of for united s approach to managing through the challenging economic cycle has been to aggressively deal with credit problems and dispose of troubled assets quickly  taking losses as necessary 
united s provision for loan losses was million in compared with million in  reflecting the improvement in the credit quality of united s loan portfolio 
net charge offs for were million compared with million in during the second quarter of  in conjunction with a bulk sale transaction the bulk loan sale  performing substandard loans with a carrying amount of million and nonperforming loans with a carrying amount of million were sold for million 
since the execution of the problem asset disposition plan in the first quarter of  united s allowance for loan losses analysis has indicated a lower allowance requirement each quarter than the previous quarter  resulting in provisions for loan losses being below the amount of net charge offs 
the only exception was the third quarter of  due to the classification of united s largest lending relationship 
as united s historical loss experience and other credit measures have improved  the amount of estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio  as measured by united s quarterly analysis of the allowance for loan losses  has decreased accordingly 
as of december   united s allowance for loan losses was million  or of loans compared to million  or of loans at the end of nonperforming assets of million  which excludes assets that are covered by loss sharing agreements with the fdic  were of total assets at december   compared to as of december  taxable equivalent net interest revenue was million for  compared to million in the million  or decrease in net interest revenue  was primarily the result of lower yields on the loan and securities portfolios  which were due to loan pricing competition and the reinvestment of maturing and called securities proceeds at record low interest rates 
the decrease in net interest revenue was substantially offset by lower deposit costs 
net interest margin increased basis points from in to in due primarily to the smaller balance of interest earning assets 
during the financial crisis  united maintained levels of liquidity well in excess of the level carried during periods of more stable economic conditions 
the higher levels of liquidity inflated the balance sheet at a slightly negative spread 
beginning in and continuing throughout  united has removed much of the excess liquidity from its balance sheet as credit concerns and economic conditions began to stabilize 
also contributing to the margin improvement was a higher average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits 
fee revenue of million was up million  or  from overdraft fees declined  or  as a result of regulatory changes requiring customer consent before using overdraft services 
this decline was more than offset by a million increase in atm and debit card fee revenue 
in addition  beginning january   united began assessing service fees on low balance demand deposit accounts which increased other deposit service charges by million over mortgage loan and related fees increased million compared to the prior year  due to higher origination volumes that were driven by record low mortgage rates 
hedge ineffectiveness gains recognized in were  compared with million in 
table of contents for  operating expenses of million were down million  or  from the same period in the prior year 
lower salary and employee benefits expense accounted for million of the decrease  due to the reduction in staff levels 
at december   united had  staff compared with  at december   a reduction of staff 
foreclosed property costs were million lower in  due to the problem asset disposition that drove up foreclosed property costs in united s focus on reducing costs and improving operational efficiency resulted in the reduction of most expense categories in as of december   united established litigation reserves of million by recording a charge to other operating expenses 
the litigation reserves are described in more detail below in transaction with fletcher international legal disputes 
loans at december  were billion  up million from the end of this was the first year over year loan growth since much of the loan growth resulted from united s focus on owner occupied commercial real estate and small business lending 
united has also been running a successful home equity line of credit promotion that added million in new loans in the second half of the year 
in addition  united purchased million of indirect auto loans during totaling million  residential construction loans at december  represented of outstanding loans  down from at the end of  a decrease of million 
deposits were down million to billion  as united focused on reducing interest expense by allowing attrition in higher rate certificates of deposit by not aggressively competing with rates 
united s focus was to increase low cost core transaction deposits which grew million in  excluding public funds deposits 
at the end of  total equity capital was million  up million from december   reflecting the company s return to profitability in at december   all of united s regulatory capital ratios were above well capitalized levels 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include united s accounting for the allowance for loan losses  fair value measurements and income taxes 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon future events 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record the valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies for united are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements 
management considers the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on non impaired loans based on historical loss experience  management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is based on analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on impairment analyses of all nonaccrual loans over  accruing substandard loans in relationships over million and troubled debt restructured loans tdrs  which are all considered impaired loans 
these analyses involve judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the historical loss element is determined using the weighted average of actual losses incurred over the prior eight quarters for each type of loan  updated quarterly 
the weighted average is weighted toward the most recent quarters loss experience 
the historical loss experience is adjusted for known changes in economic conditions and credit quality trends such as changes in the amount of past due and nonperforming loans 
the resulting loss allocation factors are applied to the balance of each type of loan after removing the balance of impaired loans and other specifically allocated loans from each category 
the loss allocation factors are updated quarterly 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations of credit and changes in portfolio mix 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetectable losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  the unallocated allowance includes a component that accounts for the inherent imprecision in loan loss estimation based on historical loss experience as a result of united s growth through acquisitions  which have expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates  and changed its portfolio mix 
also  loss data representing a complete economic cycle is not available for all sectors 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical losses used in developing loss allocation factors may not be representative of actual losses inherent in the portfolio 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its processes for determining the allowance adequately considers all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
additional information on united s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses can be found in the sections of management s discussion and analysis titled asset quality and risk elements and nonperforming assets and in the sections of part i  item titled lending policy and loan review and nonperforming assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes additional information on united s accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses 
fair value measurements united s impaired loans and foreclosed assets may be measured and carried at fair value  the determination of which requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments 
at december   the percentage of total assets measured at fair value was 
see note fair value in the consolidated financial statements herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
when a loan is considered impaired  a specific valuation allowance is allocated  if necessary  so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
in addition  foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost  fair value  less cost to sell  or listed selling price less cost to sell  following foreclosure 
fair value is defined by gaap as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
gaap further defines an orderly transaction as a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets 
it is not a forced transaction for example  a forced liquidation or distress sale 
recently in the bank s markets there have been very few transactions in the type of assets which represent the vast majority of the bank s impaired loans and foreclosed properties which reflect orderly transactions as so defined 
instead  most transactions in comparable assets have been distressed sales not indicative of fair value 
accordingly  the determination of fair value in the current environment is difficult and more subjective than it would be in a stable real estate environment 
although management believes its processes for determining the value of these assets are appropriate and allow united to arrive at a fair value  the processes require management judgment and assumptions and the value of such assets at the time they are revalued or divested may be significantly different from management s determination of fair value 
in addition  because of this increased subjectivity in fair value determinations  there is greater than usual grounds for differences in opinions  which may result in increased disagreements between management and the bank s regulators  disagreements which could cause the bank to change its judgments about fair value 

table of contents the fair values for available for sale and held to maturity securities are generally based upon quoted market prices or observable market prices for similar instruments 
united utilizes a third party pricing service to assist with determining the fair value of its securities portfolio 
the pricing service uses observable inputs when available including benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids and offers 
these values take into account recent market activity as well as other market observable data such as interest rate  spread and prepayment information 
when market observable data is not available  which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities  the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management 
as of december   united had  of available for sale securities valued using unobservable inputs 
this amount represents less than 
of total assets 
united periodically reviews available for sale securities that are in an unrealized loss position to determine whether other than temporary impairment exists 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
the primary factors united considers in determining whether impairment is other than temporary are long term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments  and united s ability and intent to hold the security until the amortized cost basis is recovered 
united uses derivatives primarily to manage interest rate risk 
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices  dealer quotes and internal pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data 
united mitigates the credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit 
in addition  certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to united when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits 
income tax accounting income tax liabilities or assets are established for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are also established for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and deductions that can be carried forward used in future years 
the valuation of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is considered critical as it requires management to make estimates based on provisions of the enacted tax laws 
the assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of regulatory agencies and federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
at december   united reported no net deferred tax asset  due to a full valuation allowance of million 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
united s management considers both positive and negative evidence 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
because of the significant weight given to recent losses  management determined that a full valuation allowance was necessary 
regulatory risk based capital rules limit the amount of deferred tax assets that a bank or bank holding company can include in tier capital 
generally  deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of such deferred tax assets that the bank expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on its projected future taxable income for that year or ii of the amount of the bank s tier capital 
mergers and acquisitions united selectively engages in the evaluation of strategic partnerships 
mergers and acquisitions present opportunities to enter new markets with an established presence and a capable management team already in place 
united employs certain criteria to ensure that any merger or acquisition candidate meets strategic growth and earnings objectives that will build future franchise value for shareholders 
additionally  the criteria include ensuring that management of a potential partner shares united s community banking philosophy of premium service quality and operates in attractive markets with excellent opportunities for further organic growth 
united will continue to evaluate potential transactions as they are presented  including acquisitions of failed banks to the extent we are permitted to bid on them 
discontinued operations effective march   united sold its brintech subsidiary 
as a result  the operations of brintech are being accounted for as a discontinued operation 
all revenue  including the gain from the sale  expenses and income taxes relating to brintech have been deconsolidated from the consolidated statement of operations and are presented on one line titled loss income from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
because brintech s assets  liabilities and cash flows were not material to the consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows  no such adjustments have been made to those financial statements 

table of contents gaap reconciliation and explanation this form k contains non gaap financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with gaap 
such non gaap financial measures include  among others  the following taxable equivalent interest revenue  taxable equivalent net interest revenue  operating provision for loan losses  operating fee revenue  total operating revenue  operating expense  operating income loss  operating earnings loss per share and operating earnings loss per diluted share 
management uses these non gaap financial measures because it believes they are useful for evaluating our operations and performance over periods of time  as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our operations and performance 
management believes these non gaap financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial results and credit trends  as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies 
a reconciliation of these operating performance measures to gaap performance measures is included on the tables on pages and in  united recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter 
also in  united received a partial recovery of million  net of recovery costs  in the fourth quarter resulting from fraud losses incurred in relating to two failed real estate developments near spruce pine  north carolina 
in  united recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million during the third and first quarters  respectively 
in addition  united recorded severance costs of million during the first quarter of and a bargain purchase gain on the acquisition of southern community bank in the amount of million during the second quarter of net operating income loss excludes the effect of the goodwill impairment charge of million and the million fraud loss partial recovery in  the goodwill impairment charges of million  the million bargain purchase gain on acquisition  and the million in severance costs in  because management believes that the circumstances leading to those items were isolated  non recurring events and do not reflect overall trends in united s earnings and financial performance

united has no ownership interest in the llcs 
the asset sale transaction was completed on april  with the bank selling nonperforming commercial and residential construction loans and foreclosed properties having a carrying value of million in exchange for cash of million and notes receivable for million 
the loans made to the llcs in connection with their respective purchases have the same terms for all six loans 
the loans have an initial term of five years and principal and interest payments are based on a year amortization schedule 
the assets in the llcs are cross pledged as collateral on all six loans 
correspondingly  prepayments on the loans are required as properties are sold in order for the collateral to be released upon sale 
the interest rate during the loan term is fixed at for all loans and  accordingly  each loan was recorded at a discount as the interest rate was considered below market 
at the time the llcs were formed  they were capitalized with sufficient cash to make the required down payment on the purchase and of the purchase price in cash and securities to cover the first three years of required cash flows 
these funds are held in escrow as additional collateral on the loans and cannot be removed by fletcher without united s consent 
the securities that can be held by the llcs are marketable equity securities and funds managed by fletcher affiliates 
carrying costs include debt service payments  servicing fees and other direct costs associated with holding and managing the underlying properties 
cash flow from expected sales of underlying assets loans foreclosed real estate is expected to be sufficient to service the loans for another five to six quarters 
while recent news articles and other sources have questioned the financial health of fletcher and its affiliates  the loans to the llcs have performed according to their contractual terms since inception 
however  during the third quarter of  united determined that the ultimate repayment of the million loan relationship through the sale of the underlying collateral is unlikely due to the lack of sales activity and further decline in real estate values 
as a result  united recorded a loan loss provision of million during the third quarter of and recorded a partial charge off in the same amount during the fourth quarter 

table of contents as part of the transaction  united and fletcher entered into a servicing agreement whereby united will act as servicer of the nonperforming assets for fletcher in exchange for a servicing fee of basis points 
because the servicing arrangement is considered a normal servicing arrangement and the fee is appropriate for the services provided  united did not recognize a servicing asset or liability related to the servicing agreement 
also on april   united and fletcher international ltd 
fletcher ltd  together with fletcher inc and their affiliates  fletcher  entered into a securities purchase agreement the securities purchase agreement pursuant to which fletcher ltd 
agreed to purchase from united  shares of united s series c convertible preferred stock  par value per share the convertible preferred stock  at a purchase price of  per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million  subject to certain conditions precedent 
concurrently with the payment of the million deposit under the asset purchase agreement by fletcher  united also granted a million warrant to fletcher to purchase non voting common stock equivalent junior preferred stock junior preferred stock 
the warrant may only be exercised by net share settlement cashless exercise and is exercisable for nine years from may   subject to limited extensions upon certain events and certain conditions precedent 
the junior preferred stock could be convertible into  common shares exercisable at a price equivalent to per share 
accounting treatment although the asset purchase agreement and the securities purchase agreement were two separate agreements  they were accounted for as part of one transaction because they were entered into simultaneously and the securities purchase agreement was dependent upon the sale of nonperforming assets 
united evaluated this transaction to determine whether the transfer should be accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing and whether the fletcher llcs should be consolidated with united 
when evaluating whether the transfer should be accounted for as a sale  united primarily evaluated whether control had been surrendered  the rights of fletcher to exchange and pledge the assets  and whether united retains effective control  which included evaluating any continuing involvement in the assets 
based on the evaluation  the transfer of assets under the asset purchase agreement meets the definition as a sale under current accounting standards and was accounted for as such 
united further evaluated whether the fletcher llcs should be consolidated which included evaluating whether united has a controlling financial interest and is therefore the primary beneficiary 
this evaluation principally included determining whether united directs the activities that have the most significant impact on the llcs economic performance and whether united has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the llcs 
based on that evaluation  the llcs have not been included as part of the consolidated group of subsidiaries in united s consolidated financial statements 
in addition to evaluating the accounting for the transfer of assets  united considered whether the warrant and the option to purchase convertible preferred stock with an additional warrant should be accounted for as liabilities or equity instruments 
in making this evaluation  united considered whether fletcher or any subsequent holders of the instruments could require settlement of the instruments in cash or other assets rather than common or preferred stock 
because the transaction was structured so that the warrants and option to purchase convertible preferred stock and the additional warrant can only be settled through the issuance of common or preferred stock  united concluded that the warrant and option to purchase convertible preferred stock with an additional warrant should be accounted for as equity instruments 
all of the components of the transaction  including all equity instruments issued under the securities purchase agreement and the notes receivable received as consideration from the sale of nonperforming assets were recorded at fair value 
because the value of the equity instruments and assets exchanged in the transaction exceeded the value of the cash and notes receivable received  united recorded a loss of million on the transaction with fletcher

filb co filed a lawsuit against united with respect to purported contractual rights under the securities purchase agreement that filb co claimed were assigned to it by fletcher 
fletcher made the purported assignment to filb co in response to redemption requests to fletcher by several investors in one of fletcher s funds leveraged 
fletcher then transferred its interests in filb co to those investors  who challenged fletcher s attempted redemption as commercially worthless in liquidation proceedings commenced in the grand court of the cayman islands 
as the result of those proceedings  the cayman court ordered the liquidation of leveraged  and a court appointed liquidator was appointed to manage filb co 
subsequently  fletcher filed for bankruptcy protection in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
fletcher has stated that it did not assign the warrant or its right to an alleged registration failure penalty under the securities purchase agreement apart from a claim for a portion thereof to filb co  and united has received purported partial warrant exercise notices from fletcher that include incorrect calculations of the number of settlement shares fletcher would receive upon exercise and demands for the payment of such a penalty 
united believes that any current exercise of the warrant would not result in the issuance of any settlement shares because  among other things  the warrant may only be exercised for net shares via a cashless exercise formula  and  following united s reclassification of its common stock in the form of for reverse stock split  or recombination  the reverse stock split adjusted market price component of that formula does not exceed the exercise price to yield any net shares 
united also believes that no registration failure penalty is due 
as a result  united has responded to fletcher with united s calculations related to the warrant and denied any liability for any such penalty 
in connection with the filb co settlement  united recorded million in litigation charges which includes the establishment of litigation reserves associated with claims that may be made against united by fletcher 
the settlement with filb co is expected to be completed promptly following completion of a definitive agreement and the receipt of necessary court approvals 
results of operations the remainder of this financial discussion focuses on operating earnings  which excludes the goodwill impairment charge and partial fraud loss recovery in  the goodwill impairment charges  and the gain on acquisition and severance costs in  except for the discussion of income taxes 
operating and gaap earnings were the same in  and for additional information on operating earnings measures  refer to the preceding section on non gaap financial measures 

table of contents there are a few large items included in operating earnings that are generally nonrecurring in nature that affect comparability between periods 
although credit losses in all periods were elevated  reflecting the weak economic cycle of the past four years  in  united s credit losses reflected the execution of the problem asset disposition plan 
that plan included the bulk loan sale which removed united s most challenging problem assets and resulted in a significant decrease in the level of problem assets 
as a result  the problem asset disposition plan accelerated united s return to profitability following the first quarter of capital transaction 
in addition  operating earnings in included a million charge to operating expense resulting from the fletcher transaction  which increased the net loss per share by  and the million income tax expense related to establishment of a full deferred tax valuation allowance 
united reported net earnings of million for the year ended december  this compared to a net loss of million for the same period in diluted earnings per common share for was 
this compared to diluted loss per share for of 
net interest revenue taxable equivalent net interest revenue the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities is the single largest component of united s revenue 
united actively manages this revenue source to provide optimal levels of revenue while balancing interest rate  credit  and liquidity risks 
taxable equivalent net interest revenue totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  from taxable equivalent net interest revenue for decreased million  or  from the decrease in net interest revenue in compared to was primarily due to lower yields on the securities and loan portfolios and smaller balances of interest earning assets 
the decrease in net interest revenue in compared to was due primarily to lower levels of average loan balances which were substantially offset by lower rates on deposits and a more favorable deposit mix 
united continued its focus on loan and deposit pricing  in an effort to maintain a steady level of net interest revenue 
the average yield on loans for decreased basis points from  reflecting the continuing effect of the low interest rate environment and competition for a limited number of quality lending opportunities 
average loans decreased million in  or  from the decrease in the loan portfolio has begun to stabilize  however  there is a high level of competition for quality lending relationships  which continues to put pressure on loan pricing 
loan charge offs  foreclosure activity and management s efforts to rebalance the loan portfolio by reducing the concentration of residential construction loans have contributed to declining loan balances 
while loan balances have declined  united continues to make new loans and in  united experienced the first positive year over year growth in loan balances since the increase in residential real estate loans is primarily the result of the promotion of a new home equity line product in mid average interest earning assets for the year decreased million  or  from due primarily to the decrease in average loans mentioned above and management s efforts to more effectively manage liquidity 
during the financial crisis  management maintained liquidity above normal levels 
beginning in and through  management reduced excess liquidity as the economic environment began to stabilize and credit quality and earnings performance began to improve 
average investment securities for increased million from a year ago  however the average yield decreased basis points as management was unable to reinvest the cash proceeds of maturing securities at yields comparable to those of the securities they replaced 
the combined effect of lower loan and investment securities yields drove the average yield on interest earning assets for to  down basis points from in abnormally high prepayment activity on mortgage backed securities also suppressed the securities portfolio yield in by accelerating the amortization of bond purchase premiums  and the yields at which the proceeds were reinvested fell short of the yields on the bonds they replaced 
partially offsetting the lower loan and securities yields was a higher average yield on other interest earning assets  due primarily to the use of reverse repurchase agreements including collateral swap transactions where united enters into a repurchase agreement and reverse repurchase agreement simultaneously with the same counterparty subject to a master netting agreement 
in these transactions  the offsetting balances are netted on the balance sheet 
average interest bearing liabilities in decreased million  or  from the prior year due to the rolling off of higher cost brokered deposits and certificates of deposit  as noninterest bearing demand deposits increased million and overall funding needs decreased 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for was 
compared to for  reflecting united s concerted efforts to reduce deposit pricing 
also contributing to the overall lower rate on interest bearing liabilities was a shift in the mix of deposits away from more expensive time deposits toward lower rate transaction deposits 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest revenue the net interest spread and the net interest margin 
the net interest spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the effect of non interest bearing deposits and other non interest bearing funding sources and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is an indication of the profitability of a company s overall balance sheet management activities and is defined as net interest revenue as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  which includes the positive effect of funding a portion of interest earning assets with customers non interest bearing deposits and with shareholders equity 

table of contents for  and  united s net interest spread was   and  respectively  while the net interest margin was   and  respectively 
the improvement in both ratios in compared to was primarily due to united shrinking the balance sheet by reducing some of the excess liquidity that had built up during the financial crisis and by lower rates paid on certificates of deposit and brokered deposits 
in  interest reversals on performing loans classified as held for sale as part of the bulk loan sale reduced net interest margin by three basis points

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio and corresponding analysis of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each reporting period 
the operating provision for loan losses was million in  compared with million in  and million in as a percentage of average outstanding loans  the operating provision was  and  respectively  in  and the amount of provision recorded in each year was the amount required such that the total allowance for loan losses reflected the appropriate balance  in the estimation of management  and was sufficient to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was million lower than the provision  primarily due to the improvement in credit trends during as well as the elevated level of charge offs in resulting from the execution of the problem asset disposition plan 
in addition  during the third quarter of  united recorded an additional loan loss provision of million specifically related to the classification of its largest lending relationship 
in  the increase in the provision for loan losses compared to was primarily due to the increased level of charge offs in the first quarter of recorded in conjunction with the problem asset disposition plan and transfer of loans to the held for sale category in anticipation of the bulk loan sale 
the ratio of net loan charge offs to average outstanding loans for was compared with for and for  excluding the million partial recovery 
as the residential construction and housing markets have struggled  it has been difficult for many builders and developers to produce cash flow needed to service debt from selling lots and houses 
this deterioration that began in the residential construction and housing market was the primary factor that resulted in higher credit losses and an increase in nonperforming assets over the last four years 
although a majority of the loan charge offs have been within the residential construction and development portion of the portfolio  credit quality deterioration migrated to other loan categories as pressure resulting from economic conditions has persisted and unemployment levels have remained high throughout united s markets

atm and debit card interchange fees were higher due to an increase in debit card transaction volumes 
mortgage loan and related fees of million were up million  or  from in  united closed  mortgage loans totaling million compared with  loans totaling million in origination volumes were driven by the changing interest rate environment which had a significant impact on refinancing activities

united also recognized losses from the prepayment of fhlb advances and structured repurchase agreements totaling million and  in and  respectively 
the losses were part of the same balance sheet management activities that resulted in the securities gains 
the balance sheet management activities included the sale of million in securities and the prepayment of million in fixed rate borrowings  the effect of which was to reduce sensitivity to rising interest rates and to improve the net interest margin 
the net gain was net of  in impairment charges in the first quarter of  on trust preferred securities of a bank whose financial condition had deteriorated 
the impairment charge was more than offset by realized gains from securities sales 
in  united recognized  in revenue from hedge ineffectiveness compared with million in hedge ineffectiveness for is reported net of  in accelerated amortization of prepaid broker fees on brokered certificates of deposit that were called during the year 
the brokered cds were called at the same time the callable swaps that were hedging the brokered cds were called 
the accelerated amortization is presented as a component of hedge ineffectiveness as the broker fees were embedded in the swap contracts that were hedging the fair value of the brokered cds and therefore resulted in an offsetting gain at the time the swaps were called 
much of the hedge ineffectiveness in and related to terminated cash flow hedges where the gains realized on the terminated positions are being deferred over the original term of the derivative instrument 
the ineffectiveness  which is caused by a decrease in qualifying prime based loans  resulted in the accelerated recognition of the deferred gains 
in  the hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses resulted primarily from ineffectiveness on fair value hedges of brokered deposits 

table of contents other fee revenue of million for was up million  or  from the prior year 
fees from customer swap transactions earned under united s back to back customer swap program accounted for  of the increase

nonrecurring items in include a million charge for goodwill impairment 
the million loss on the sale of nonperforming assets to fletcher was incurred during the second quarter of although the loss from the bulk sale of nonperforming assets in resulted from an isolated event  because disposition of nonperforming assets is considered an operating activity  it is not excluded from operating expenses as a nonrecurring item  but has been separated to make trend comparisons more meaningful 
including the loss on sale of nonperforming assets and those nonrecurring charges  operating expenses for were million 
salaries and employee benefits expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from the decrease was due to a combination of reduced staffing  lower group medical insurance costs and a reduction in the matching contribution on united s k and profit sharing plan that became effective on april  headcount totaled  at december  compared to  at december   a decrease of positions 
both and included severance charges that affect comparability between periods

professional fees were million for  a decrease of  or  from the decrease was primarily due to approximately million in professional services costs associated with the bulk loan sale in foreclosed property expenses include foreclosure and carrying costs and realized losses and write downs of foreclosed properties 
foreclosure and carrying costs for were million  a decrease of million from while these costs have remained elevated throughout the weak economic cycle  the decrease from is due to the lower level of foreclosed properties 
the foreclosure and carrying costs category includes legal fees  property taxes  marketing costs  utility services  and maintenance and repair charges 
realized losses and write downs on foreclosed property totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the decrease reflects higher writedowns in the first half of on foreclosed properties to expedite sales under the problem asset disposition plan 
fdic assessments and other regulatory charges expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from the fdic s change to an asset based formula effective april  was favorable to united which lowered the assessment going forward 
united s assessment rate was reduced further late in the second quarter of other expenses totaled million for  a increase of million  or  from the increase is primarily due to a million charge in to establish litigation reserves that was partially offset by an elevated level of property taxes and other loan collateral costs incurred to prepare loans for the bulk loan sale in the prior year 
as part of the transaction  the purchaser required united to pay all unpaid property taxes on collateral supporting the sold loans 

table of contents income taxes income tax expense was million in  compared to income tax benefit of million in and income tax expense of million in  respectively

the tax benefit included the reversal of previously established reserves for uncertain tax positions of million as a result of the tax returns upon which the tax positions were claimed no longer being subject to audit as a result of statute expiration and due to the settlement of a state tax dispute 
with the full valuation allowance on united s net deferred tax asset  united s tax expense on its pre tax earnings mostly represents adjustments to its reserve for uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under the federal alternative minimum tax 
at december  and  united reported no net deferred tax assets due to a full valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
management considers both positive and negative evidence and analyzes changes in near term market conditions as well as other factors which may impact future operating results 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
the deferred tax assets are analyzed quarterly for changes affecting realizability 
because management has determined that the objective negative evidence outweighs the positive evidence  management has established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
currently  the significant positive evidence in our analysis includes stronger capital levels and a return to profitability for five consecutive quarterly periods that were driven by significant increases in fee revenue and lower operating expenses coupled with lower credit costs due to solid improvements in credit measures and asset quality ratios 
the most significant negative evidence continues to be the historic losses resulting from the financial and economic crisis  including a cumulative three year operating loss position 
however  with continued positive trends and experience of our financial performance and credit quality during  the reliability of the financial and credit projections may be given more weight in future periods if our current trends and performance continue 
management will continue to evaluate and weigh the positive and negative evidence going forward and  if the weight of evidence shifts such that in management s estimation  the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence  the valuation allowance will be adjusted or completely reversed as appropriate 
as of february   united adopted a tax benefits preservation plan designed to protect its ability to utilize its substantial tax assets 
those tax assets include net operating losses that it could utilize in certain circumstances to offset taxable income and reduce its federal income tax liability and the future tax benefits from potential net unrealized built in losses 
united s ability to use its tax benefits would be substantially limited if it were to experience an ownership change as defined under section of the internal revenue code 
in general  an ownership change would occur if united s percent shareholders  as defined under section  collectively increase their ownership in united by more than over a rolling three year period 
the tax benefits preservation plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that united will experience an ownership change by discouraging any person or group from becoming a beneficial owner of or more of united s common stock then outstanding 

table of contents in connection with the tax benefits preservation plan  on february   united entered into a share exchange agreement with the elm ridge parties to transfer to the company  shares of united s common stock in exchange for  shares of the company s series d preferred shares and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
prior to entering into the share exchange agreement  collectively  the elm ridge parties were united s largest shareholder 
by exchanging the elm ridge parties common stock for the series d preferred shares and warrants  united eliminated its only percent shareholder and  as a result  obtained further protection against an ownership change under section additional information regarding income taxes  including a reconciliation of the differences between the recorded income tax provision and the amount of income tax computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fourth quarter discussion taxable equivalent net interest revenue for the fourth quarter of decreased million  or  to million from the same period a year ago  primarily due to lower yields on our investment securities and loan portfolios  as well as the overlap of debt financing that resulted from the issuance of senior debt at the beginning of the fourth quarter to replace subordinated debt that matured late in the fourth quarter of the net interest margin decreased seven basis points from the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of the lower yield on the loan portfolio for the fourth quarter of reflected the ongoing pricing pressure on new and renewed loans  as well as a new home equity loan product offering with a low introductory rate that will reprice in also impacting the margin was the reduction in investment interest revenue which resulted from the reinvestment of cash flows at record low rates

the decrease in the loan portfolio began with deterioration in the residential construction and housing markets 
the deterioration resulted in part from an oversupply of lot inventory  houses and land within united s markets  which further slowed construction activities and acquisition and development projects 
despite the continued weak economy and intense competition for quality credits  united continued to pursue lending opportunities 
the rate of decrease in the loan portfolio dropped significantly following the execution of the problem asset disposition plan in the first quarter of and has continued to stabilize  resulting in the modest growth in while period end loans were up at december  from a year ago  the daily average balance of loans was down as noted above due to the loans included in the bulk loan sale that increased average balances in the first quarter 
the increase in residential mortgage loans reflects a successful home equity line promotion that has gained traction in united s footprint

additional information on united s credit administration function is included in item under the heading loan review and nonperforming assets 
united classifies performing loans as substandard when there is a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardizes the repayment by the borrower and there is a distinct possibility that united could sustain some loss if the deficiency is not corrected 
united s home equity lines  which are a component of the residential mortgage portfolio  generally require the payment of interest only for a set period after origination 
after this initial period  the outstanding balance begins amortizing and requires the payment of both principal and interest 
at december  and  home equity loans totaled million and million  respectively 
approximately of the home equity loans at december  were amortizing and only a very small percentage will begin amortizing in the next twelve months 
of the million in balances outstanding at december   million  or  were first liens 
the balance at december  represents of the total committed lines 

table of contents united monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similar to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary allowance 
united also receives notification when the first lien holder is in the process of foreclosure and upon that notification  united obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge offs or reserves are warranted

commercial secured by real estate and residential construction showed the most significant decreases 
reviews of substandard performing and non performing loans  troubled debt restructures  past due loans and larger credits  are conducted on a regular basis and reported to management each quarter and are designed to identify risk migration and potential charges to the allowance for loan losses 
these reviews are presented by the responsible lending officers and specific action plans are discussed along with the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  past loan loss experience  anticipated loan losses  changes in risk profile  the effect of prevailing economic conditions on the borrower and other factors specific to the borrower and its industry 
in addition to united s internal loan review  united also uses external loan review to ensure the independence of the loan review process 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings was based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the amount each quarter is dependent upon many factors  including growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  net charge offs  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral  and other macro economic factors and trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed quarterly by management through an analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
the decreases in the provision and the stabilization of the level of the allowance for loan losses compared to the previous periods reflects stabilizing trends in substandard loans  leading to an expectation that charge off levels will continue to decline 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical data  subjective judgment and estimates and  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in united s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
consequently  management believes that the unallocated allowance appropriately reflects probable inherent but undetected losses in the loan portfolio

during the third quarter of  united recorded a provision for loan losses of million related to classifying its largest lending relationship to nonaccrual status and recorded a million partial charge off during the following quarter 

table of contents management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  reflects the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this assessment involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
the amount of any changes could be significant if management s assessment of loan quality or collateral values changes substantially with respect to one or more loan relationships or portfolios 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require adjustments to the provision for loan losses in future periods if  in their opinion  the results of their review warrant such additions

when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current interest revenue 
interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to reduce outstanding principal 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were on nonaccrual status at december   although in certain isolated cases  united executed forbearance agreements whereby united will continue to fund construction loans to completion as long as the borrower meets the conditions of the forbearance agreement 
united may also fund other amounts necessary to protect the bank s collateral such as amounts to pay past due property taxes 
the table below summarizes nonperforming assets at year end for the last five years 
it excludes assets acquired through the acquisition of scb in that are covered by loss sharing agreements with the fdic

during  there was no interest revenue recognized on loans while they were impaired 
united s policy is to discontinue the recognition of interest revenue for loans classified as impaired under asc  receivables  when a loan meets the criteria for nonaccrual status 
impaired loans decreased from to  as the level of united s nonaccrual and substandard accruing loans over million began to subside 
this decline was offset by an increased level of tdrs  which are considered impaired

during the first quarter of  million in loans transferred to held for sale were placed on nonaccrual  million in payments were received on nonaccrual loans transferred to held for sale and million in charge offs were recorded on nonaccrual loans transferred to held for sale to write them down to the expected proceeds from the sale 
foreclosed property is initially recorded at fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
if the fair value  less estimated costs to sell at the time of foreclosure  is less than the loan balance  the deficiency is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
if the lesser of fair value less estimated costs to sell  or the listed selling price less the cost to sell of the foreclosed property decreases during the holding period  a valuation allowance is established with a charge to foreclosed property expense 
when the foreclosed property is sold  a gain or loss is recognized on the sale for the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property 
financed sales of foreclosed property are accounted for in accordance with asc  real estate sales

during the first quarter of  united recorded million in write downs on foreclosed properties in order to expedite sales in the following quarters as part of its problem asset disposition plan 
investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects united s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of revenue 
the investment securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowings  including repurchase agreements 
total investment securities at december  decreased million from a year ago 
at december  and december   united had securities held to maturity with a carrying value of million and million  respectively  and securities available for sale totaling billion and billion  respectively 
at december  and  the securities portfolio represented approximately and of total assets  respectively 
at december   the effective duration of the investment portfolio based on expected maturities was years compared with years at december  
table of contents the following table shows the carrying value of united s securities

mortgage backed securities rely on the underlying pools of mortgage loans to provide a cash flow of principal and interest 
the actual maturities of these securities will differ from the contractual maturities because the loans underlying the security can prepay 
decreases in interest rates will generally cause an acceleration of prepayment levels 
in a declining or prolonged low interest rate environment  united may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from these prepayments in assets that have comparable yields 
in a rising rate environment  the opposite occurs 
prepayments tend to slow and the weighted average life extends 
this is referred to as extension risk  which can lead to lower levels of liquidity due to the delay of cash receipts  and can result in the holding of a below market yielding asset for a longer period of time 
united s asset backed securities include securities that are backed by student loans and collateralized loan obligations 
at december   united had of its total investment securities portfolio in mortgage backed securities  compared with at december  due to a lack of loan demand  united continued to purchase mortgage backed securities in order to obtain a favorable yield with low risk 
united did not have securities of any issuer in excess of of equity at year end or  excluding us government issues 
approximately of the securities portfolio is rated below a or unrated and is rated aaa 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of investment portfolio and related fair value and maturity information 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the premium paid for acquired companies above the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including separately identifiable intangible assets 
united did not report any goodwill at december  or other intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles representing the value of united s acquired deposit base  are amortizing intangible assets that are required to be tested for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
there were no events or circumstances that lead management to believe that any impairment exists in united s other intangible assets 
deposits total average deposits for were billion  a decrease of million  or  from average non interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased million  or  due to the success of core deposit programs 
united pursues customer transaction deposits by emphasizing its high customer satisfaction scores 
also impacted by the programs were now  money market and savings accounts of billion on average for  which increased million  or  from 
table of contents at december   total deposits were billion compared with billion at the end of  a decrease of million  or 
average time deposits for  including brokered time deposits  were billion  down from billion in united continued to offer low rates on certificates of deposit  allowing the balances to decline as united s funding needs declined due to weak loan demand and a shift to lower cost transaction account deposits

through this affiliation  fhlb secured advances totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
united anticipates continued use of this short and long term source of funds 
fhlb advances outstanding at december  had fixed interest rates of

during and  united prepaid million and million  respectively  of fixed rate advances and incurred prepayment charges of million and  respectively 
united will prepay advances from time to time as funding needs change 
additional information regarding fhlb advances  including scheduled maturities  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december  and  united had million and million in repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings outstanding 
during the second quarter of  united prepaid million in structured repurchase agreements and incurred prepayment charges of million 
united takes advantage of these additional sources of liquidity when rates are favorable compared to other forms of short term borrowings  such as fhlb advances and brokered deposits 
liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available  at reasonable cost  to meet ongoing operational cash needs and to take advantage of revenue producing opportunities as they arise 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending upon a variety of factors  it is the primary goal of united to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in all expected economic environments 
liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and the ability to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining united s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
in addition  because united is a separate entity and apart from the bank  it must provide for its own liquidity 
united is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its common and preferred shareholders  and interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities 
substantially all of united s liquidity is obtained from subsidiary service fees and dividends from the bank  which are limited by applicable law and the bank mou 
united currently has internal capital resources to meet these obligations and based on the bank s earnings  the bank is qualified to pay a dividend of up to million to united subject to regulatory approval 
two key objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities to optimize interest revenue 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both requirements 

table of contents the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities  as well as the ability to use these as collateral for borrowings on a secured basis 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
at december   we had million in such funds 
also  mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  federal reserve short term borrowings  fhlb advances  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional sources of liquidity and represent united s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are generally short term in nature are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs

united also has the ability to raise substantial funds through brokered deposits 
in addition to these wholesale sources  united has the ability to attract retail deposits at any time by competing more aggressively on pricing

other assets decreased million primarily due to the receipt of a prior year tax refund resulting from a loss carryback claim and the reduction of the prepaid fdic insurance assessment 
net cash used in investing activities of million consisted primarily of billion of purchases of securities  an increase in loans of million  and purchases of premises and equipment of million  that were offset by proceeds from sales of securities of million  maturities and calls of investment securities of million  and net proceeds from sales of other real estate of million 
funds collected from the fdic under loss sharing agreements were million  providing another source of cash flows from investing activities 
the million of net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of a net decrease in deposits of million and a decrease in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements of million 
united also repaid million in long term debt which was offset by the issuance of million in senior notes 
in the opinion of management  united s liquidity position at december  was sufficient to meet its expected cash flow requirements

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as extending loan facilities to customers 
those commitments are primarily issued to local businesses 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
united uses the same credit underwriting procedures for making commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees  as it uses for underwriting on balance sheet instruments 
united evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of the collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include unimproved and improved real estate  certificates of deposit  personal property or other acceptable collateral 
all of these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the total amount of these instruments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements because a significant portion of these instruments expire without being used 
united is not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments  or that could significantly affect earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off balance sheet arrangements 
at december  and  united had million and million  respectively  in offsetting repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements that were netted in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  at december   united had million in offsetting securities lending agreements that were netted in the consolidated balance sheet 
united enters into these collateral swap arrangements from time to time as a source of additional revenue 
capital resources and dividends shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million from december  accumulated other comprehensive income  which includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale  the unrealized gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  and unamortized prior service cost and actuarial gains and losses on united s modified retirement plan  is excluded in the calculation of regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
excluding the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income  shareholders equity increased million  or  from december  united accrued million in dividends  including accretion of discounts  on series a  series b and series d preferred stock in united accrued million in dividends  including discount accretion  on series a and series b preferred stock  for the year ended december  united granted a warrant to fletcher to purchase common stock equivalent junior preferred stock that could be convertible into  common shares exercisable at a price equivalent to per share 
united has received purported partial warrant exercise notices from fletcher with respect to its warrants that included incorrect calculations of the number of settlement shares fletcher would receive upon exercise 
on june   united completed a reclassification of its common stock in the form of for reverse stock split  or recombination 
united believes that any current exercise of fletcher s warrant would not result in the issuance of any settlement shares because the warrant may only be exercised for net shares via a cashless exercise formula  and the reverse stock split adjusted market price component of that formula does not exceed the exercise price to yield any net shares 
united has responded to fletcher with united s calculations related to the warrant 
in november  united entered into an informal memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the georgia department of banking and finance that superseded the board resolution previously requested by the federal reserve 
the holding company mou provides  similar to the superseded resolution  that united may not incur additional indebtedness  pay cash dividends  make payments on our trust preferred securities or subordinated indebtedness or repurchase outstanding stock without prior approval of the federal reserve and dbf 
additionally  the holding company mou requires  among other things  that united ensures that the bank functions in a safe and sound manner 
united believes it is in compliance with all requirements of the holding company mou 
the bank is currently subject to an informal memorandum of understanding with the federal deposit insurance corporation and the georgia department of banking and finance 
the bank mou requires  among other things  that the bank maintain its tier leverage ratio at not less than and its total risk based capital ratio at not less than during the life of the bank mou 
additionally  the bank mou requires  among other things  that prior to declaring or paying any cash dividends to united  the bank must obtain the written consent of its regulators 
the bank believes it is in compliance with all requirements of the bank mou 

table of contents the board of governors of the federal reserve has issued guidelines for the implementation of risk based capital requirements by us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk weighted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier capital 
however  to be considered well capitalized under the guidelines  a total risk based capital ratio is required  of which must be tier capital 
under the risk based capital guidelines  assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor  or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
the aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with the category 
the resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are added together  and generally this sum is the company s total risk weighted assets 
risk weighted assets for purposes of united s capital ratios are calculated under these guidelines 
tier capital consists of shareholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income  intangible assets goodwill and deposit based intangibles  and disallowed deferred tax assets  plus qualifying capital securities 
united s tier capital totaled million at december  tier capital components include supplemental capital such as the qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
tier capital plus tier capital is referred to as total risk based capital and was million at december  the ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier capital divided by average assets adjusted for goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required  the federal reserve board requires a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio of greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
on december   united participated in treasury s cpp by selling  shares of series b preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares  shares  as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and a reduction following united s stock offering of united s common stock to treasury 
the proceeds of million were allocated between the series b preferred stock and the warrant based on their relative fair values at the time of the sale 
of the million in proceeds  million was allocated to the series b preferred stock and million was allocated to the warrant 
the discount recorded on the series b preferred stock that resulted from allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrant is being accreted directly to retained earnings over a five year period applying a level yield 
the exercise price of the warrant is per share per share  as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and is exercisable at any time on or before december  the series b preferred stock qualifies as tier capital under risk based capital guidelines and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
the series b preferred stock may be redeemed after december  at the stated amount of  per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series b preferred stock is non voting except for class voting rights on matters that would adversely affect the rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock 
united has outstanding junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities totaling million at december  the related trust preferred securities of million excluding common securities qualify as tier capital under risk based capital guidelines provided that total trust preferred securities do not exceed certain quantitative limits 
at december   all of united s trust preferred securities qualified as tier capital 
further information on united s trust preferred securities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
united has subordinated debentures outstanding that qualify as tier capital under the risk based capital guidelines 
the securities begin to lose their tier capital treatment as they approach maturity  losing per year in each of the five years leading up to maturity 
of the million in subordinated debt that united had outstanding at december   million qualified as tier capital under risk based capital guidelines

effect of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important effect on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than nominal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
united s management believes the effect of inflation on financial results depends on united s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary effect on performance 
united has an asset liability management program to monitor and manage united s interest rate sensitivity position 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity management the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant effect on united s profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changing interest rates  in order to achieve united s overall financial goals 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
united s net interest revenue  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
united manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the alco and approved by the board of directors 
alco meets periodically and has responsibility for formulating and recommending asset liability management policies to the board of directors  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing united s interest rate sensitivity 
one of the tools management uses to estimate the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changes in interest rates is an asset liability simulation model 
resulting estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  loan and deposit re pricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
alco periodically reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations  however  actual net interest revenue may differ from model results 
the primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over time using multiple interest rate scenarios 
the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared to in order to measure the change in net interest revenue 
policy limits are based on immediate rate shock scenarios  as well as gradually rising and falling rate scenarios  which are compared to the base scenario 
another commonly analyzed scenario is a most likely scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on the slope of the forward yield curve 
other scenarios analyzed may include delayed rate shocks  yield curve steepening or flattening or other variations in rate movements 
while policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame  longer time horizons are also modeled 
all policy scenarios assume a static balance sheet 

table of contents united s policy is based on the month impact on net interest revenue of interest rate shocks and ramps that increase or decrease from to basis points from the base scenario 
in the shock scenarios  rates immediately change the full amount at the scenario onset 
in the ramp scenarios  rates change by basis points per month 
united s policy limits the change in net interest revenue over the first months to a decrease for each basis point change in the increasing and decreasing rate ramp and shock scenarios 
historically low rates on december  and made use of the down scenarios problematic 
the following table presents united s interest sensitivity position at december  and table interest sensitivity increase decrease in net interest revenue from base scenario at december  change in rates shock ramp shock ramp basis point increase basis point decrease interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the effect of interest rate changes on net interest revenue 
united may have some discretion in the extent and timing of deposit repricing depending upon the competitive pressures in the markets in which it operates 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly even when the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  due to the two instruments repricing according to different indices 
this is commonly referred to as basis risk 
in order to manage its interest rate sensitivity  united periodically enters into off balance sheet contracts that are considered derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments can be a cost effective and capital effective means of modifying the repricing characteristics of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
these contracts generally consist of interest rate swaps under which united pays a variable rate  or fixed rate  as may be the case and receives a fixed rate or variable rate  as may be the case 
united s derivative financial instruments are classified as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
the change in fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income 
fair value hedges recognize currently in earnings both the effect of the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and the offsetting effect of the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability associated with the particular risk of that asset or liability being hedged

table of contents in addition to derivative instruments  united uses a variety of balance sheet instruments to manage interest rate risk such as investment portfolio holdings  wholesale funding and bank issued deposits 
from time to time  united will terminate swap or floor positions when conditions change and the position is no longer necessary to manage united s overall sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
in those situations where the terminated swap or floor was in an effective hedging relationship at the time of termination and the hedging relationship is expected to remain effective throughout the original term of the contract  the resulting gain or loss is amortized over the remaining life of the original contract 
at december   united had  in gains from terminated derivative positions included in other comprehensive income that will be amortized into earnings over the next twelve months 
united s policy requires all non customer derivative financial instruments be used only for asset liability management through the hedging of specific transactions or positions  and not for trading or speculative purposes 
management believes that the risk associated with using derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk sensitivity is minimal and should not have any material unintended effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in order to mitigate potential credit risk  from time to time united may require the counterparties to derivative contracts to pledge securities as collateral to cover the net exposure
