our md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k  as well as the risk factors set forth in item a above 
summary net sales and operating revenues decreased million  or  to  million when compared with last year 
this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in comparable store sales  which was partially offset by increased sales in our target mobile centers that were open for all of but not all of the decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by sales decreases in our consumer electronics and mobility platforms at our us radioshack company operated stores  which were partially offset by increased sales in our signature platform and increased comparable store sales at our target mobile centers 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to  million when compared with last year 
this decrease was primarily driven by decreased gross profit in our postpaid wireless business in our us radioshack company operated stores 
gross margin rate decreased by percentage points from last year to 
the decrease in our consolidated gross margin rate was a result of the decrease in the gross margin rate of our postpaid wireless business 
when excluding the postpaid wireless business  the gross margin rate for the balance of our business was comparable to selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased million when compared with last year 
this decrease was primarily driven by decreased advertising expense  decreased rent and occupancy expense  and decreased compensation expense in the second half of additionally  sg a in was lower due to a one time million charge in related to our transition from t mobile to verizon and a one time million charge in related to the closure of our chinese manufacturing plant 
these decreases were partially offset by increased costs in the first half of to support additional target mobile centers that were not open in the same period in and severance costs of million in connection with the departure of our chief executive officer combined with the termination of employment of certain corporate headquarters support staff in the third quarter of as a result of the factors above  we incurred an operating loss of million  compared with operating income of million last year 
operating income for our us radioshack company operated stores segment was million  compared with million last year 
the operating loss for our target mobile centers was million  compared with an operating loss of million last year 
our effective tax rate for was a negative  compared with for the effective tax rate was affected by a valuation allowance in the amount of million that we established to reduce our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was partially offset by an income tax benefit related to our current year operating loss 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information regarding our income tax expense and valuation allowance 
loss from continuing operations was million  or per share  in  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in executive overview during our operating results were significantly affected by our postpaid wireless business in our us radioshack company operated stores and our target mobile segment 
postpaid wireless business the combination of the following factors at our us radioshack company operated stores contributed to more than half of our million decrease in consolidated gross profit from total postpaid units sold decreased by from the average cost per unit sold increased by from the average revenue per unit sold increased by from these factors were also present at our target mobile centers  however  gross profit increased at our target mobile centers in due to increased sales primarily from the additional target mobile centers that were open for the full first six months of but were not open for the full first six months of the decrease in the number of postpaid units sold at our us radioshack company operated stores was primarily driven by decreased unit sales in our sprint and at t postpaid wireless businesses 
some of the factors contributing to our lower unit sales were changes in sprint s customer and credit models and the discontinuation of sprint s early upgrade program for certain customers that began in mid  higher sales in the third quarter of related to a special wireless handset promotion  the soft postpaid market due to consumer anticipation of the iphone launch  and inventory supply constraints during the initial iphone launch period 
the increase in average cost per unit was driven by the change in our sales mix towards higher cost smartphones such as the apple iphone and android based smartphones 
the increase in the average revenue per postpaid unit was primarily driven by a change in our sales mix towards higher priced smartphones  which was partially offset by an increase in commissions repaid to wireless service providers related to customers whose wireless handsets were deactivated from a wireless network because either they could not afford to  or chose not to  pay the higher monthly payments for wireless service associated with their smartphones 
we have undertaken initiatives to reduce wireless service deactivations in for further discussion of our accounting for these service deactivations  see critical accounting policies and estimates later in this md a

us radioshack company operated stores segment net sales and operating revenues year ended december  in millions mobility signature consumer electronics net sales and operating revenues sales in our us radioshack company operated stores segment decreased million or in sales in our mobility platform which includes postpaid and prepaid wireless handsets  commissions and residual income  prepaid wireless airtime  e readers  and tablet devices decreased in this decrease in sales was primarily driven by decreased sales in our postpaid wireless business 
this decrease was partially offset by increased sales of tablet devices 
the sales decrease in our postpaid wireless business was driven by a decrease in the number of postpaid units sold  which was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per unit sold 
the decrease in the number of postpaid wireless handsets sold was primarily driven by decreased unit sales in our sprint and at t postpaid wireless businesses 
some of the factors contributing to our lower unit sales were changes in sprint s customer and credit models and the discontinuation of sprint s early upgrade program for certain customers that began in mid  higher sales in the third quarter of related to a special wireless handset promotion  the soft postpaid market due to consumer anticipation of the iphone launch  and inventory supply constraints during the initial iphone launch period 
the increase in the average revenue per postpaid unit was primarily driven by a change in our sales mix towards higher priced smartphones  which was partially offset by an increase in commissions repaid to wireless service providers related to wireless handset deactivations 
see the executive summary of this md a for further discussion of these wireless handset deactivations 
sales in our signature platform which includes accessories for wireless  tablet  music  and home entertainment products  batteries and power products  and technical products increased in product categories with sales increases during this period included wireless accessories  headphones  and tablet accessories 
product categories with sales decreases during the period included home entertainment accessories and personal computer accessories 
sales in our consumer electronics platform which includes laptop computers  residential telephones  toys  gps units  digital music players  personal computing products  cameras  and other consumer electronics products decreased in this sales decrease was driven by sales declines in laptop computers  cameras  music players  gps devices  and televisions 
the decrease in sales for many of these categories has been driven by the migration of the capabilities of these products into smartphones 
target mobile centers sales in our target mobile centers segment increased million or in this sales increase was driven primarily by increased sales at our target mobile centers in the first half of  when compared with the same period in this increase in target mobile center sales was driven by the additional target mobile centers that were open for the full first six months of but were not open for the full first six months of in october  we exercised our contractual right to notify target of our intention to stop operating the target mobile centers if we could not amend the current arrangement 
an acceptable arrangement was not negotiated  therefore  we will exit this business by april  other sales amounts in other sales reflect our business activities that are not separately reportable  including sales to our independent dealers  sales generated by our www 
radioshack 
com website  and sales at our mexican subsidiary 
each of these business activities accounted for less than of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues in other sales were essentially flat for  when compared with last year 
our sales increased at our mexican subsidiary due to new store openings  but this increase was substantially offset by decreased sales to our us independent dealers 
additionally  we recognized million of franchise fee revenue in the third quarter related to the opening of our first franchised stores in southeast asia 
gross profit consolidated gross profit and gross margin are as follows year ended december  in millions gross profit gross profit decrease increase gross margin rate consolidated gross profit and gross margin for were  million and  respectively  compared with  million and  respectively  in  resulting in a decrease in gross profit dollars and a percentage point decrease in our gross margin 
these decreases were primarily driven by decreased gross profit of the postpaid wireless business in our us radioshack company operated stores 
the decrease in gross profit dollars of the postpaid wireless business in our us radioshack company operated stores was the result of decreases in in the number of units sold and in the average gross profit dollars per unit sold  when compared with average gross profit dollars per unit sold decreased because our average cost per unit increased from last year at a higher rate than the increase in our average revenue per unit 
the increase in average cost per unit was driven by the change in our sales mix towards higher cost smartphones such as the apple iphone and android based smartphones 
the decrease in our consolidated gross margin rate was a result of the decrease in the gross margin rate of the postpaid wireless business in our us radioshack company operated stores and target mobile centers 
the decrease in the gross margin rate of our postpaid wireless business was driven by a change in our sales mix towards lower margin smartphones and a decrease in the average gross profit dollars per unit sold 
when excluding the postpaid wireless business  the gross margin rate for the balance of our business was comparable to selling  general and administrative expense our consolidated sg a expense decreased  or million  in sg a as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues was essentially flat when compared with the table below summarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated sg a expense and their related percentages of total net sales and operating revenues 
year ended december  dollars of sales revenues dollars of sales revenues dollars of sales revenues in millions compensation rent and occupancy advertising other taxes excludes income taxes utilities insurance credit card fees professional fees repairs and maintenance licenses printing  postage and office supplies recruiting  training and employee relations travel matching contributions to savings plans other the decrease in sg a expense was driven by decreased advertising expense  decreased rent and occupancy expense  and decreased compensation expense in the second half of additionally  sg a in was lower due to a one time million charge in related to our transition from t mobile to verizon and a one time million charge in related to the closure of our chinese manufacturing plant 
these decreases were partially offset by increased costs in the first half of to support additional target mobile centers that were not open in the same period last year and severance costs of million in connection with the departure of our chief executive officer combined with the termination of employment of certain corporate headquarters support staff in the third quarter of we announced on september   that our board of directors and mr 
james f 
gooch had agreed that mr 
gooch would step down from his position as chief executive officer and as a director of the company  effective immediately 
under mr 
gooch s employment agreement  he was entitled to a specified cash payment and the accelerated vesting of certain stock awards 
during the third quarter ended september   we recorded million of employee separation charges in connection with mr 
gooch s departure 
this included a cash charge of million and a non cash charge of million related to the accelerated vesting of stock awards 
during the third quarter ended september   we recorded million of employee separation charges in connection with the termination of the employment of approximately employees  who worked primarily at our corporate headquarters 
depreciation and amortization the table below provides a summary of our total depreciation and amortization by segment 
year ended december  in millions us radioshack company operated stores target mobile centers other unallocated total depreciation and amortization from continuing operations the table below provides an analysis of total depreciation and amortization 
year ended december  in millions depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization included in cost of products sold total depreciation and amortization from continuing operations impairment of long lived assets and goodwill impairment of long lived assets was million in compared with million in target mobile centers in october we exercised our contractual right to notify target of our intention to stop operating the target mobile centers by no later than april if we could not amend the current arrangement 
we concluded that the cash flows generated by our target mobile centers under our current contractual arrangements would not recover the net book value of our long lived assets held and used in these locations 
therefore  the long lived assets at these locations with a total carrying value of million were written down to their fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million that was included in our operating results for the third quarter of we will exit this business by april  the fair value of these in use assets was based on the projected cash flows at each location under our current contractual arrangements 
us radioshack company operated stores impairments for long lived assets held and used in certain stores were million in compared with million in this increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of stores that were evaluated for impairment throughout because of their decreased operating results 
if our operating results do not improve  we will continue to incur a similar or higher amount of long lived asset impairments for us radioshack company operated stores in future periods 
goodwill impairment for the first half of  we experienced a significant decline in the market capitalization of our common stock  which was driven primarily by lower than expected operating results 
our market capitalization was lower than our consolidated net book value for much of this period 
we determined that these facts were an indicator that we should conduct an interim goodwill impairment test in the third quarter 
after reviewing our reporting units  we determined that the fair value of our us radioshack company operated stores reporting unit could not support its million of goodwill due to our lower market capitalization 
this resulted in a million impairment charge that was included in our operating results for the third quarter of our us radioshack company operated stores reporting unit is comprised of our us radioshack company operated stores operating segment  our overhead and corporate expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments  and all of our interest expense 
net interest expense consolidated net interest expense  which is interest expense net of interest income  was million in  compared with million in in and  interest expense consisted primarily of interest paid at the stated coupon rate on our outstanding notes  the non cash amortization of the discounts on our long term debt  and interest paid on our term loans 
interest expense increased million in this increase was driven by the increased average amount of long term debt outstanding during non cash interest expense was million in compared with million in income tax expense our effective tax rate for was a negative  compared with a positive for the effective tax rate was affected by a valuation allowance in the amount of million that we established to reduce our us deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was partially offset by an income tax benefit related to our current year operating loss 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information regarding our income tax expense and valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate was affected by the realization of job retention credits generated pursuant to the hiring incentives to restore employment act 
these credits lowered the effective tax rate by percentage points 
compared with net sales and operating revenues net sales and operating revenues for increased million  or  to  million when compared with comparable store sales decreased 
the increase in our net sales and operating revenues was driven primarily by sales at the target mobile centers that were open on december   but not on december  the increase in sales that was driven by our additional target mobile centers was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales 
the decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by sales decreases in our consumer electronics and signature platforms  which were partially offset by an increase in our mobility platform sales 
us radioshack company operated stores segment sales in our us radioshack company operated stores segment for decreased million or when compared with sales in our mobility platform increased in this sales increase was driven by increased sales in our at t postpaid business  sales in our verizon postpaid business  and sales of tablet devices 
these sales increases were partially offset by decreased sales in our t mobile postpaid wireless business and decreased sales in our sprint postpaid wireless business 
the decreased sales in our sprint postpaid wireless business were due to changes in sprint s customer and credit models  which resulted in fewer new and upgrade activations in the last three quarters of sales in our signature platform decreased in this sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales of digital to analog television converter boxes and related television antennas  music accessories  and media storage  but was partially offset by increased sales of headphones and tablet accessories 
sales in our consumer electronics platform decreased in this sales decrease was driven by sales declines in substantially all of the categories in this platform  but was primarily driven by decreased sales of digital music players  digital cameras and camcorders  and gps devices 
the convergence of these products functionality into smartphones contributed to these sales decreases 
target mobile centers sales in our target mobile centers segment for increased million when compared with this sales increase was driven primarily by sales at the target mobile centers that were open on december   but not on december  other sales other sales decreased million  or  in this sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales to our independent dealers  which was partially offset by a sales increase at our mexican subsidiary 
our mexican subsidiary accounted for less than of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues in gross profit consolidated gross profit and gross margin for were  million and  respectively  compared with  million and  respectively  in  resulting in a decrease in gross profit dollars and a percentage point decrease in our gross margin rate 
gross margin decreased by percentage points from to 
this decrease was primarily driven by a change in our sales mix within our mobility platform towards lower margin smartphones and tablets  combined with the overall growth of our mobility platform through our target mobile centers and us radioshack company operated stores 
smartphones generally  and the apple iphone in particular  carry a lower gross margin rate given their higher average cost basis 
revenue from smartphones as a percentage of our mobility platform in was percentage points higher than in additionally  our gross margin rate was negatively affected by more promotional pricing in the fourth quarter of when compared with the same period in the gross margin rate for our us radioshack company operated stores segment decreased by percentage points in  primarily due to a change in sales mix towards lower margin smartphones as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expense our consolidated sg a expense increased  or million  in this represents a percentage point increase as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues compared to the increase in sg a expense was primarily driven by increased costs to support our target mobile centers of approximately million  a one time charge of million related to our transition from t mobile to verizon classified as other sg a  and million in costs related to the closure of our chinese manufacturing plant 
these increases were partially offset by decreased incentive compensation expense in our other retail channels as well as our corporate office 
depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization from continuing operations for declined million or 
impairment of long lived assets impairments of long lived assets were million and million in and  respectively 
in these amounts were related primarily to underperforming us radioshack company operated stores 
in this amount was related primarily to underperforming us radioshack company operated stores and certain test store formats 
net interest expense consolidated net interest expense  which is interest expense net of interest income  was million in  compared with million in in and  interest expense primarily consisted of interest paid at the stated coupon rate on our outstanding notes  the non cash amortization of the discounts on our long term debt  cash received on our interest rate swaps  and the non cash change in fair value of our interest rate swaps 
interest expense increased million in this increase was driven by the increased average amount of long term debt outstanding during  the increased debt discount amortization related to our convertible notes  and increased commitment fees related to the five year million asset based revolving credit facility we entered into on january   with a group of lenders with bank of america  na  as administrative and collateral agent the credit facility 
non cash interest expense was million in compared with million in income tax expense our effective tax rate for was  compared with for the effective tax rate was affected by the realization of job retention credits generated pursuant to the hiring incentives to restore employment act 
these credits lowered the effective tax rate by percentage points

these discrete items lowered the effective tax rate by percentage points 
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note summary of significant accounting policies under the section titled new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow overview operating activities cash used in operating activities in was million  compared with cash provided by operating activities of million in cash flows from operating activities are comprised of net income or loss plus non cash adjustments to net income or loss and the net changes in assets and liabilities 
the amounts of cash provided by net income or loss plus non cash adjustments to net income or loss were million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in net income plus non cash adjustments was primarily driven by our net loss in of million compared with a net income of million in the amount of cash used by the net changes in assets and liabilities was million in  compared with cash provided by the net changes in assets and liabilities of million in the increase in cash used by the net changes in assets and liabilities in was primarily driven by cash used for our increased inventory balance at december   which was partially offset by income tax refunds of million and by cash provided by our increased accounts payable balance 
our inventory balance was larger at december   than it was at december   primarily due to a higher average unit cost of  and larger quantities of  wireless handsets 
the increase in inventory was also driven by increased inventory in our higher margin signature platform  which was primarily driven by increased wireless accessories and headphones 
investing activities the amounts of cash used in investing activities were million and million in and  respectively 
this change was driven by the increase in our restricted cash balance  which was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures in for further discussion of our restricted cash  see cash requirements later in this md a 
capital expenditures were million in compared with million in this decrease was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures for our target mobile centers in when we opened many of these locations 
capital expenditures primarily related to our us radioshack company operated stores and information system projects in and our capital expenditures in also related to our target mobile centers 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared with net cash used in financing activities of million in our net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the million of new borrowings 
these borrowings were partially offset by the purchase of million principal amount of our convertible notes and our dividend payments of million 
our net cash used in financing activities for was primarily driven by the repurchase of million of our common stock and the payment of a million annual dividend 
free cash flow our free cash flow  defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property  plant and equipment  was a negative million in  million in  and million in the decrease in free cash flow for was attributable to decreased cash flow from operating activities as described above 
we believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt  change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value 
see liquidity outlook later in this md a for further discussion of our sources of liquidity and our cash requirements in future periods 
the comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is net cash flows provided by or used in operating activities 
net cash flows used in operating activities was million in  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million in and  respectively 
we do not intend for the presentation of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  nor do we intend to imply that free cash flow represents cash flow available for discretionary expenditures 
the following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow 
year ended december  in millions net cash used in provided by operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment dividends paid free cash flow sources of liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared with million as of december  the table below lists our credit commitments from various financial institutions at december  in millions commitment expiration per period credit commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years lines of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments at december   our maximum availability for revolving borrowings was million 
no revolving borrowings have been made under the facility  and letters of credit totaling million had been issued as of december   resulting in million of availability for revolving borrowings 
credit facility in august we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement restated credit facility or credit facility with a group of lenders with bank of america  na  as the administrative and collateral agent 
the restated credit facility amends and restates the company s existing asset based revolving credit agreement the original credit facility 
the restated credit facility revised the terms of the original credit facility to  among other things  provide for million of term loans 
like the original credit facility  the restated credit facility matures on january   and provides for an asset based revolving credit line of million  subject to a borrowing base  which was million at december  as with the original credit facility  obligations under the restated credit facility are secured by substantially all of our inventory  accounts receivable  cash  and cash equivalents 
obligations under the restated credit facility are also secured by certain real estate 
as with the original credit facility  revolving borrowings under the restated credit facility bear interest at our choice of a bank s prime rate plus to or libor plus to 
the applicable rates in these ranges are based on the aggregate average availability under the facility 
the restated credit facility also contains a million sub limit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit 
the issuance of letters of credit reduces the amount available under the facility 
letter of credit fees are to for standby letters of credit and to for commercial letters of credit 
we pay commitment fees to the lenders at an annual rate of of the unused amount of the facility 
the maximum availability for revolving borrowings under the credit facility is determined at the end of each month and is calculated as the lesser of million  or our borrowing base for revolving borrowings less million calculated as million at december   or our borrowing base for revolving borrowings up to a maximum amount of million less the greater of currently million or million if we do not meet a specified consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio during a trailing twelve month period calculated as million at december  
as of december   our maximum availability for revolving borrowings under the credit facility was million as a result of us not meeting the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio at december  as of december   no revolving borrowings had been made under the facility  and letters of credit totaling million had been issued  resulting in million of availability for revolving borrowings under the credit facility 
we believe that we will not meet the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio for at least the next twelve months 
if at any time the outstanding revolving borrowings and term loans under the credit facility exceed the sum of the revolving borrowing base and the term loan borrowing base  we will be required to repay an amount equal to such excess 
no payments whether optional or mandatory may be made in respect of the principal amount of these term loans unless all revolving borrowings have been repaid  any outstanding letters of credit have been cash collateralized  and all other commitments under the restated credit facility have been repaid or otherwise satisfied 
the revolving borrowing base and term loan borrowing base are subject to customary reserves that may be implemented by the administrative agent at its permitted discretion 
the restated credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are substantially consistent with those contained in the original credit facility 
these covenants could  among other things  restrict certain payments  including dividends and share repurchases 
we do not believe the limitations contained in the credit facility will  in the foreseeable future  adversely affect our ability to use the credit facility and execute our business plan 
cash requirements capital expenditures the nature of our capital expenditures is comprised of a base level of investment required to support our current operations and a discretionary amount related to our strategic initiatives 
the base level of capital expenditures required to support our operations ranges from million to million 
the remaining amount of anticipated capital expenditures relates to strategic initiatives as reflected in our annual plan 
these capital expenditures are discretionary and  therefore  may not be spent if we decide not to pursue one or more of our strategic initiatives 
we estimate that our capital expenditures for will range from million to million based on our operating performance during the year 
us radioshack company operated store remodels and relocations and information systems projects will account for the majority of our anticipated capital expenditures 
cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities will be used to fund future capital expenditure needs 
additionally  our credit facility could be utilized to fund capital expenditures 
restricted cash restricted cash totaled million at december   and is included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
this cash is pledged as collateral for a standby letter of credit issued to our general liability insurance provider 
we have the ability to withdraw this cash at any time and instead provide a letter of credit issued under our credit facility similar to the letter of credit that was issued under our credit facility at december  we have elected to pledge this cash as collateral to reduce our costs associated with our general liability insurance 
seasonal inventory buildup typically  our annual cash requirements for pre seasonal inventory buildup from august to november range between million and million 
the funding required for this buildup will be primarily from cash and cash equivalents and any cash generated from operating activities 
additionally  our credit facility could be utilized to fund the inventory buildup  if necessary 
operating leases we use operating leases  primarily for our retail locations and our corporate campus  to lower our capital requirements 
contractual obligations the table below contains our known contractual commitments as of december  in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total for more information regarding long term debt  refer to note indebtedness and borrowing facilities of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for more information regarding lease commitments  refer to note commitments and contingencies of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
purchase obligations primarily include our product commitments and marketing agreements 
these long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet represented contractual obligations for which we could reasonably estimate the timing of cash payments 
additionally  we had a million non current deferred tax liability that we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which this liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  this amount has not been included in the table 
the remaining non current liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet did not represent contractual obligations for future cash payments 
in we entered into a million secured term loan due in january  a million secured term loan due in september  and a million secured term loan due in september we borrowed these amounts in advance of the maturity of our convertible notes 
these new loans represented approximately of the original million principal amount of the convertible notes 
we repurchased million principal amount of the convertible notes at a discount in we plan to repay the remaining million of convertible notes with cash on hand and borrowings from our credit facility  if necessary 
for more information regarding our long term debt  refer to note indebtedness and borrowing facilities of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
liquidity outlook as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared with million in additionally  we had a credit facility of million with availability of million as of december  this resulted in a total liquidity position of million at december  we experienced a loss of million in  and our cash flows from operating activities declined from cash provided by operations of million in to cash used in operations of million in although we do not anticipate borrowing under our credit facility during  we may cause letters of credit to be issued under this credit facility  which would reduce our total liquidity position 
if our results of operations for are significantly worse than  or if our trade payables decrease  we could be required to utilize more of our credit facility in the form of borrowings or additional letters of credit 
however  in this event  we could implement cash conservation activities such as reducing our spending for professional fees  reducing our capital expenditures  reducing our spending for advertising  lowering our inventory balances or not taking advantage of discounts for early payments to vendors 
we have considered the impact of our financial projections on our liquidity analysis and have evaluated the appropriateness of the key assumptions in our forecast such as sales  gross profit and sg a expenses 
we have analyzed our cash requirements  including our inventory position  other working capital changes  capital expenditures and borrowing availability under our credit facility 
based upon these evaluations and analyses  we expect that our anticipated sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our obligations without disposition of assets outside the ordinary course of business or significant revisions of our planned operations through if the trend in our results of operations continues or worsens after  we may be required to borrow more under our credit facility  or to take additional actions to improve our liquidity that would be outside the ordinary course of business 
these actions could include incurring additional debt at higher interest rates  reducing our capital expenditures to amounts below those required to support our current level of operations  closing a significant number of stores  further reducing our employee headcount  or selling one or more subsidiaries 
capitalization the declaration of dividends  the dividend rate  and the amount and timing of share repurchases are at the sole discretion of our board of directors  and plans for future dividends and share repurchases may be revised by the board of directors at any time 
the following table sets forth information about our capitalization on the dates indicated 
december  dollars in millions dollars of total capitalization dollars of total capitalization short term debt long term debt total debt stockholders equity total capitalization our debt to total capitalization ratio increased in from  primarily due to the million of new borrowings under the secured term loans due in and these borrowings were partially offset by purchase of million principal amount of the convertible notes 
dividends we paid per share dividends in the first and second quarters of on july   we announced that we were suspending our dividend 
we paid per share annual dividends of and in and  respectively 
our dividend payments totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively  and were funded from cash on hand 
share repurchase program in october our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to million of our common stock to be executed through open market or private transactions 
during the fourth quarter of  we paid million to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock in open market purchases 
as of december   there was million available for share repurchases under this program 
we announced on january   that we had suspended further share repurchases under this program 
share repurchase program in november we completed a million accelerated share repurchase asr program that we entered into in august we repurchased million shares under the asr program 
in addition  after the conclusion of the asr program in november  we repurchased million worth of shares in the open market  representing million shares 
during the second quarter of  we paid million to purchase million shares of our common stock in open market purchases 
this completed our purchases under our share repurchase program 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or special purpose entities 
inflation inflation has not significantly affected us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant effect on our operations in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management s judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition  inventory valuation  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  and stock based compensation 
we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the selection  application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition description our revenue is derived principally from the sale of name brand and private brand products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless telephone handsets  require the customer to use the services of a third party wireless service provider 
the wireless service provider pays us an upfront commission for obtaining a new customer or upgrading an existing customer and  in some cases  a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
for certain new customers the upfront commission revenue is repaid to the wireless service provider if the wireless handset is subsequently deactivated from the wireless network during a specified period 
our sale of an activated wireless handset is the single event required to meet the delivery criterion for both the upfront commission and the recurring residual revenue 
upfront commission revenue  net of estimated wireless service deactivations  is recognized at the time an activated wireless handset is sold to the customer at the point of sale 
recurring residual revenue  which is not fixed and determinable at the point of sale  is recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the wireless service provider  which is typically as the wireless service provider bills its customer  generally on a monthly basis 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our revenue recognition accounting methodology requires us to make certain judgments regarding the estimate of future sales returns and wireless service deactivations 
our estimates for product refunds and returns  wireless service deactivations and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items 
based on our extensive history in selling activated wireless handsets  we have been able to establish reliable estimates for wireless service deactivations 
however  our estimates for wireless service deactivations can be affected by certain characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers 
these factors include changes in the quality of their customer service  the quality and performance of their networks  their rate plan offerings  their policies regarding extensions of customer credit  and their wireless handset product offerings 
these factors add uncertainty to our estimates 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate sales returns or wireless service deactivations during the past three fiscal years 
we continue to update our estimate for wireless service deactivations to reflect the most recently available information regarding the characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers discussed above 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to these or various other factors  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected 
a difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately million in inventory valuation description our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of cost on a first in first out basis or market 
the cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost  which is net of vendor allowances  and certain allocated freight  distribution  warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the location where it is offered for sale 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate typically  the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost 
determination of the market value may be very complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer trends  competitive pricing  performance of similar products or accessories  planned promotional incentives  technological obsolescence  and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions 
if the estimated market value  calculated as the amount we expect to realize  net of estimated selling costs  from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory  is determined to be less than the recorded cost  we record a provision to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate our inventory valuation reserves 
differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold 
if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve 
we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our inventory valuation reserves 
however  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances for self insurance  income taxes  and litigation contingencies description the amount of liability or valuation allowance we record related to insurance claims  tax positions  and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expense that will ultimately be incurred or the realization of certain assets 
we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  property and other liability claims  with deductibles up to million per occurrence 
this insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that result in liability in excess of the deductible 
we also have a self insured health program administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period 
this estimate is based on historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other factors we deem relevant 
we are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
our accounting for tax estimates and contingencies requires us to evaluate tax issues and establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of the probability of realizing these tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years  therefore  our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred tax asset if based on the consideration of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
we evaluate our deferred income taxes quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering available evidence  including historical and projected taxable income and tax planning strategies 
any deferred tax asset subject to a valuation allowance is still available to us to offset future taxable income  and we will adjust a previously established valuation allowance if we change our assessment of the amount of deferred income tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized 
we are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
our accounting for legal contingencies requires us to estimate the probable losses in these matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside legal counsel and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our liabilities for insurance  tax and legal contingencies contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with these items 
we use our history and experience  as well as the specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially affect our results of operations and financial position or liquidity 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate our insurance  tax  or legal contingencies reserves during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions for these items 
however  a change in our insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million 
as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our estimates 
additionally  for claims that exceed our deductible amount  we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries  since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant 
although we believe that our insurance  tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
these actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill description long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as insufficient cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
the carrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
we estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value  and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded 
additionally  if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new existing carrying value of the asset and the new remaining useful life 
our policy is to evaluate long lived assets for impairment at a store level for retail operations 
we have acquired goodwill related to business acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we review our goodwill balances on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit might exceed its fair value 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we recognize an impairment loss for this difference 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our impairment loss calculations for long lived assets contain uncertainties because they require us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives and assumptions about market performance 
we also apply judgment in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in our current business model 
our impairment loss calculations for goodwill contain uncertainties because they require us to estimate fair values of our reporting units 
we estimate fair values based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and comparable market analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require us to make judgments and assumptions regarding future profitability  industry factors  planned strategic initiatives  discount rates and other factors 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies we use to assess impairment loss for long lived assets or goodwill during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in calculating goodwill impairment 
if actual results or performance of certain business units are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges  which could be material to our results of operations 
for example  if the profitability of our us radioshack company operated stores segment does not increase from our level  there could be a material increase in the impairment of long lived assets at certain of our us radioshack company operated stores in future periods 
the total value of our goodwill at december   was million 
of this amount  million related to goodwill from the purchase of radioshack de mexico 
based on our most recent review of goodwill impairment  we noted that the fair values of our reporting units that had goodwill balances were substantially greater than their carrying values 
stock based compensation description we have historically granted certain stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted stock and deferred stock units 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock based incentive plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a more complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
at the date an award is granted  we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which typically is the period over which the award vests 
the restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a lattice model with monte carlo simulations 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate the black scholes merton and lattice models require management to apply judgment and use subjective assumptions  including expected option life  volatility of stock prices  and employee forfeiture rate 
we use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and employee forfeiture rate  and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies used to record stock based compensation during the past three years 
while the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
additionally  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods 
a change in our stock based compensation expense in would have affected our net income by approximately million 
factors that may affect future results matters discussed in our md a and in other parts of this annual report on form k include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act 
these forward looking statements are statements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of words such as expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  intend  potential or similar words 
these matters include statements concerning management s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions 
we specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report  including any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and  therefore  involve a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we held no derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our cash equivalents of million and our million of term loans that bear interest at variable rates  in each case at december  a hypothetical increase in short term interest rates would result in a corresponding decrease in annual net interest expense of approximately million 
short term liquid investments at variable interest rates currently yield less than on an annualized basis 
a hypothetical decrease of short term interest rates to zero would result in a corresponding increase in annual net interest expense of approximately million 
this hypothetical example assumes no change in the proportionate relationship between our cash equivalent balance and the amount of our variable interest rate debt 
we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our purchase of inventory from manufacturers located in china and other areas outside the us our purchases are denominated in us dollars  and any weakening of the us dollar against the chinese currency  or other currencies  could cause our vendors to increase the prices of items we purchase from them 
it is not possible to estimate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our purchases of this inventory 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to our mexican subsidiary  which accounted for less than of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues in
