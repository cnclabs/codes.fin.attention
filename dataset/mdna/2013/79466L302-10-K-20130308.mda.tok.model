overview we are a provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions 
we were founded on the simple concept of delivering customer relationship management  or crm  applications via the internet  or cloud 
we introduced our first crm solution in february and we have expanded our offerings with new editions  solutions and enhanced features  through internal development and acquisitions 
we sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis 
our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers  partners  employees and products in entirely new ways 
our objective is to deliver solutions to help companies transform the way they sell  service  market and innovate 
with our four core services sales cloud  service cloud  marketing cloud and the salesforce platform customers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies 
key elements of our strategy include strengthening our market leading core solutions  innovating in high growth markets  improve renewal rates  deepening relationships with our existing customer base  pursuing new customers aggressively  building our business in top markets globally  and encouraging the development of third party applications on our cloud computing platforms 
we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services  the availability  performance and security of our service  our ability to continue to release  and gain customer acceptance of  new and improved features  our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies  successful customer adoption and utilization of our service  acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers  the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors  the location of new data centers  third party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms  our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel  and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services  delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates 
to address these factors  we will need to  among other things  continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions  upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition or arrangements such as a social enterprise license agreement  provide high quality technical support to our customers  
table of contents encourage the development of third party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal 
our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity  the hiring of additional personnel  particularly in direct sales  other customer related areas and research and development  the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities  continuing to develop our brands  the addition of distribution channels  the upgrade of our service offerings  the development of new services  the integration of acquired technologies  the expansion of our marketing cloud and salesforce platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth 
we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses  joint ventures  services and technologies  and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings 
we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry 
as a result of our aggressive growth plans  specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities  we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a gaap basis 
as we continue with our growth plan  we anticipate we will have net losses on a gaap basis for the next several quarters 
in november  we purchased approximately acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco  california  including entitlements and improvements associated with the land 
we have capitalized all pre construction activities related to the development of the land  including interest costs and property taxes since the november purchase 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we suspended pre construction activity 
the total carrying value of the land  building improvements and perpetual parking rights was million as of january  we continue to evaluate our future needs for office facilities space and our options for the undeveloped real estate 
we expect marketing and sales costs  which were percent of our total revenues for fiscal and percent for fiscal  to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers  and build greater brand awareness 
on august   we acquired the outstanding stock of buddy media  inc  buddy  a social media marketing platform 
we acquired buddy for the assembled workforce  expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating buddy s social media marketing platform with our current offerings 
the financial results of buddy are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the total purchase price for buddy was million 
we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in making that assessment  we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine  based on the weight of available evidence  whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in our evaluation  we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence as of october  and recorded a one time  non cash charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal in the amount of million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
this accounting treatment has no effect on our actual ability to utilize deferred tax assets such as loss carryforwards and tax credits to reduce future cash tax payments 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on january references to fiscal  for example  refer to the fiscal year ending january  
table of contents sources of revenues we derive our revenues from two sources subscription revenues  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees  and related professional services such as process mapping  project management  implementation services and other revenue 
other revenue consists primarily of training fees 
subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues during fiscal subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers  varying service types  the price of our service and service renewal rates 
we define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity eg  a company  a distinct business unit of a large corporation  a partnership  etc 
that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services 
we define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer authorized users  and we refer to each such user as a subscriber 
the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands 
none of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal   or subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract 
the typical subscription and support term is to months  although terms range from one to months 
our subscription and support contracts are non cancelable  though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform 
we generally invoice our customers in advance  in annual or quarterly installments  and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue  or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in general  we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 
professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training 
our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis 
we also offer a number of training classes on implementing  using and administering our service that are billed on a per person  per class basis 
our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues  we consider a number of factors  which are described in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below 
prior to february   the deliverables in multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
if the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately  the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement 
a significant portion of our multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables 
additionally  in these situations  we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu which amended the previous multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance 
pursuant to the new guidance  objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement separately 
instead  arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis 
we applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after february  which was the beginning of our fiscal 
table of contents seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service 
over percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service 
we generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we introduced greater operational discipline around annual invoicing  for both new business and renewals which resulted in an increase in deferred revenue 
the fourth quarter of fiscal marks the one year anniversary of this operational shift  therefore the incremental benefit to deferred revenue from annual invoicing was lower than it was in the fourth quarter of fiscal occasionally  we bill customers for their multi year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue 
we typically issue renewal invoices days in advance of the renewal service period  and depending on timing  the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters 
this may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable 
there is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns 
our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals 
the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 
accordingly  the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below in thousands april  july  october  january  fiscal accounts receivable  net deferred revenue  current and noncurrent in thousands april  july  october  january  fiscal accounts receivable  net deferred revenue  current and noncurrent in thousands april  july  october  january  fiscal accounts receivable  net deferred revenue  current and noncurrent unbilled deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year  non cancelable subscription agreements 
unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and  accordingly  are not recorded in deferred revenue 
unbilled deferred revenue was approximately billion as of january  and approximately billion as of january  due to our sales to large enterprise accounts  we are experiencing longer contractual commitments by our customers which is reflected in our growing unbilled deferred revenue 
also as a result  our average contract length has grown and is now between and months 
this has a positive impact on our renewal rate 
we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons  including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements  varying billing cycles of subscription agreements  the specific timing of customer renewals  foreign currency fluctuations  the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue  and changes in customer financial circumstances 
for multi year subscription agreements billed annually  the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period  zero 
table of contents just prior to renewal  and increases if the agreement is renewed 
low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer 
accordingly  we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year to year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle 
such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support  the costs of data center capacity  depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software  allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies 
we allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure  rent and occupancy charges based on headcount 
employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services  including stock based expenses  the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead 
the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 
we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services 
for example  we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future 
additionally  as we acquire new businesses and technologies  the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues 
the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  in the affected periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead 
we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services  integrating acquired technologies  increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services 
our proprietary  scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application 
as a result  we do not have to maintain multiple versions  which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 
we expect that in the future  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new  and improve existing  technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  for our sales and marketing staff  including commissions  payments to partners  marketing programs and allocated overhead 
marketing programs consist of advertising  events  corporate communications  brand building and product marketing activities 
we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  building brand awareness  attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events 
the timing of these marketing events  such as our annual and largest event  dreamforce  will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter 
we expect that in the future  marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  for finance and accounting  legal  internal audit  human resources and management information systems personnel  legal costs  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in the future  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute 
table of contents dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs  professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion 
we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters 
stock based expenses 
our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non employee directors 
we recognize our stock based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods 
these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases  as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 
for fiscal  we recognized stock based expense of million 
as of january   the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was billion 
we expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal  and million during fiscal the expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of january  and assumes no forfeiture activity 
we expect to continue to issue stock based awards to our employees in future periods 
amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations 
our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts  trade names  customer lists and customer relationships 
we expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues from two sources subscription revenues  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee  and related professional services such as process mapping  project management  implementation services and other revenue 
other revenue consists primarily of training fees 
we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been or is being provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our subscription service arrangements are non cancelable and do not contain refund type provisions 

table of contents subscription and support revenues subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract  which is the date our service is made available to customers 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
professional services and other revenues the majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis 
when these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting  as discussed below  these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts  and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts 
training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 
multiple deliverable arrangements we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include subscription  premium support  and professional services 
prior to february   the deliverables in multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
if the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately  the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement 
a significant portion of our multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables 
additionally  in these situations  we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu which amended the previous multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance 
pursuant to the updated guidance  objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement separately 
instead  arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis 
we have applied the updated accounting guidance to those multiple deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after february  which was the beginning of fiscal the adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended january  as of january   the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are million and approximately million  respectively  which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period 
under the updated accounting guidance  in order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting  the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery 
if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery  we account for each deliverable separately 
subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately 
in determining whether professional services have standalone value  we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the 
table of contents services from other vendors  the nature of the professional services  the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date  and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer s satisfaction with the professional services work 
to date  we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value 
under the updated accounting guidance  when multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy 
we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe  if available  or our best estimate of selling price besp  if vsoe is not available 
we have determined that third party evidence tpe is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third party pricing information 
the amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue  if any 
for certain professional services  we have established vsoe as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range 
we have not established vsoe for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency  the introduction of new services and other factors 
accordingly  we use our besp to determine the relative selling price 
we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions 
significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices  the size and volume of our transactions  the customer demographic  the geographic area where our services are sold  our price lists  our go to market strategy  historical standalone sales and contract prices 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management  taking into consideration the go to market strategy 
as our go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in relative selling prices  including both vsoe and besp 
deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year  non cancelable subscription agreements 
deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
we generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments 
deferred revenue is influenced by several factors  including seasonality  the compounding effects of renewals  invoice duration  invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter 
as a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described  billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to february  were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term 
deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent 
deferred commissions 
we defer commission payments to our direct sales force 
the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers  which are typically to months 
the commission payments  which are paid in full the month after the customer s service commences  are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements 
the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non cancelable customer contracts 
we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 

table of contents during fiscal  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
during the same period a year ago  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled million at january  and million at january  goodwill and long lived assets 
we make estimates  assumptions  and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  market conditions  and information obtained from the management of acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology  and the expected use of the acquired assets 
these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 
the value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as  but not limited to a substantial decline in our market capitalization  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  and unanticipated competition 
we evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events or changes in circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if a long lived asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
strategic investments 
we report our investments in non marketable equity and debt securities  which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately held companies  at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
management evaluates financial results  earnings trends  technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies  as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other than temporary impairment 
business combinations 
accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre acquisition contingencies 
we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts  professional services contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s trade name  trademark and existing customer relationship  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings  
table of contents uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
stock based options and awards 
we recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan espp 
the fair value of each option or award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates 
inputs into the black scholes option pricing model include the estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life 
the estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our espp is based on the two purchase periods within the month offering period  the risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a us government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights  and the future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations 
we believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world 
we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority  based on the technical merits 
the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision 
we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in making that assessment  we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis to determine  based on the weight of available evidence  whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
examples of positive and negative evidence include historical taxable income or losses  forecasted income or losses  the estimated timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized 
our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed 
our tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates  certain non deductible expenses  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws and accounting principles as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders equity

benefit from provision for income taxes 
fiscal year ended january  variance dollars in thousands benefit from provision for income taxes effective tax rate we recorded a tax provision of million during fiscal  which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of percent 
the effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of percent primarily due to the tax charge of million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in our evaluation  we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence 
during fiscal  we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of million 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
due to the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods 
see note income taxes to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of million during fiscal  which resulted in an effective tax rate of percent 
the effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of percent primarily due to federal and california tax credits and the impact of the radian acquisition 
the combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and non deductible amounts 
the effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pre tax loss

fiscal year ended january  variance dollars in thousands benefit provision for income taxes effective tax rate the benefit for income taxes was million during fiscal  compared to an income tax provision of million during fiscal our effective tax rate was percent for fiscal compared to percent for fiscal the higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and california tax credits and a tax benefit related to the may acquisition of radian the combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in the foreign tax rate differential 
foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal pre tax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal pre tax income 
the combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal effective tax rate 
the lower fiscal state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items 
first  california enacted several income tax law changes  which generally benefited california based companies 
the result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate 
second  the company was subject to minimum state taxes  which reduced the state tax benefit 
the combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal state tax benefit

 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value 
otherwise  the quantitative impairment test is not required

liquidity and capital resources at january   our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling billion and accounts receivable of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal and million during the same period a year ago 
cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization  amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations  amortization of debt discount  and the expense associated with stock based awards  the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities  the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments  the timing of collections from our customers  which is our largest source of operating cash flows  and changes in working capital accounts 

table of contents our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets 
claims against working capital include accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes 
our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods  certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal  such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings 
as described above in seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable  our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals 
the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 
additionally  due to continually increased annual cycle billing patterns  the value of customer billings during the fourth quarter of fiscal contributed to a higher accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of january  than as of january  we generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments 
we typically issue renewal invoices days in advance of the renewal service period  and depending on timing  the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters 
such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue  which is reflected on the balance sheet 
the operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and changes in working capital accounts which include the establishment of the tax valuation allowance during the year 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal and million during the same period a year ago 
the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal primarily related to the purchase of rypple  inc rypple in february  the purchase of buddy in august  the purchase of goinstant  inc goinstant in september  capital expenditures  investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal and million during the same period a year ago 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal consisted primarily of million of proceeds from equity plans and million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans offset by million of principal payments on capital leases 
in january  we issued million of convertible senior notes due january  the notes and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges the note hedges and separate warrant transactions the warrants 
the notes will mature on january   unless earlier converted 
upon conversion of any notes  we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and  with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes  shares of our common stock  cash  or a combination of both 
to date  there has been a nominal amount of conversions 
for trading days during the consecutive trading days ended october   our common stock traded at a price exceeding of the conversion price of per share applicable to the notes 
accordingly  the notes were convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending january  the notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  for trading days during the consecutive trading days ended january   our common stock traded at a price exceeding of the conversion price of per share applicable to the notes 
accordingly  the notes will be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending april   and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations  us treasury securities  us agency obligations  government obligations  collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage backed securities  time deposits  money market mutual funds and municipal securities 
as of january   we have a total of million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space 
to date  no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit  which renew annually and mature at various dates through december we do not have any special purpose entities  and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
additionally  we currently do not have a bank line of credit 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center  and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
at january   the future non cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows in thousands in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations facilities space computer equipment and furniture and fixtures convertible senior notes  including interest contractual commitments total the majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 
purchase orders are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
during fiscal and future fiscal years  we expect to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity 
we plan to upgrade and or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the company 
additionally  we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal than in fiscal as a result of continued office build outs  other leasehold improvements and data center investments 
in the future  we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures  services and technologies  and intellectual property rights 
we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 

table of contents non gaap financial measures regulation s k item e  use of non gaap financial measures in commission filings  defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non gaap financial information 
our measures of non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit  non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share each meet the definition of a non gaap financial measure 
non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit and non gaap net income we use the non gaap measures of non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit and non gaap net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period 
in addition to our gaap measures we use these non gaap measures when planning  monitoring  and evaluating our performance 
we believe that these non gaap measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business  as they exclude certain expenses 
these certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period  but are made for our long term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period 
we define non gaap net income as our total net income excluding the following components  which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses 
in each case  for the reasons set forth below  we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us  in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non cash items on our gross margin and operating performance 
additionally  as significant  unusual or discrete events occur  the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur 
stock based expenses 
the company s compensation strategy includes the use of stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives 
it is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long term employee retention  rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period 
thus  stock based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
the company views amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts  trade names  customer lists and customer relationships  as items arising from pre acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition 
while it is continually viewed for impairment  amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense  one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period 
amortization of debt discount 
under gaap  certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate 
accordingly  for gaap purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the company s million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in january the imputed interest rate is approximately  while the coupon interest rate is 
the difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense  net of the interest amount capitalized  is excluded from management s assessment of the company s operating performance because management believes that this non cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance 
management believes that the exclusion of the non cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the company s operational performance 
one time tax charge 
as a result of the company assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets  in the third quarter of fiscal the company recorded a one time  non cash charge to income tax 
table of contents expense to establish a valuation allowance against a significant portion of those assets 
the company applied significant judgment as part of this analysis including considering the company s past operating results  cumulative losses and forecasts of future taxable income 
as part of establishing a valuation allowance with respect to the company s deferred tax assets  the company will assess and record any necessary quarterly changes to the valuation allowance and the corresponding income tax expense or benefit 
management believes that the exclusion of this non cash charge is appropriate to provide investors with a better view of the company s operational performance 
income tax effects and adjustments 
the company s non gaap tax provision excludes the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal year s ordinary operating results 
examples of such tax items include  but are not limited to  changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets  certain acquisition related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items 
management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the company s operational performance we define non gaap gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues  as reported on our consolidated statement of operations  excluding the portions of stock based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues 
we define non gaap operating profit as our non gaap gross profit less operating expenses  as reported on our consolidated statement of operations  excluding the portions of stock based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses 
non gaap earnings per share management uses the non gaap earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation 
we define non gaap earnings per share as our non gaap net income  which excludes the above components  which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses  divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding 
limitations on the use of non gaap financial measures a limitation of our non gaap financial measures of non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit  non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions 
our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies  including peer companies  and therefore comparability may be limited 
thus  our non gaap measures of non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit  non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  or in isolation from  measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
additionally  in the case of stock based expense  if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock based expense  the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 
we compensate for these limitations by reconciling non gaap gross profit  non gaap operating profit  non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per share to the most comparable gaap financial measure 
we encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety  not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non gaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar and japanese yen 
we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts 
any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures 
in accordance with our policy  the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months 
additionally  by policy  we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling billion at january  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds  time deposits  corporate notes and bonds  government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes 
our investments are made for capital preservation purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points at january  could result in a million market value reduction or increase of the same amount 
this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 

table of contents at january   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling billion 
the fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in market value changes of million 
market risk and market interest risk in january  we issued at par value million of convertible senior notes due the notes 
holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  may be paid in cash or stock at our option 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants 
these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 
for the three months ended january  the notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder 
for trading days during the consecutive trading days ended january   our common stock traded at a price exceeding of the conversion price of per share applicable to the notes 
accordingly  the notes will be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending april  and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are convertible 
the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of and therefore  we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes 
however  the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price 
the carrying value of our notes was million as of january  this represents the liability component of the million principal balance as of january  the total estimated fair value of our notes at january  was  million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was 
we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies  many of which are in the development stage
