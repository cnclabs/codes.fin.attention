the sabine pass lng terminal has regasification facilities owned by cheniere partners wholly owned subsidiary  sabine pass lng  lp sabine pass lng that includes existing infrastructure of five lng storage tanks with capacity of approximately bcfe  two docks that can accommodate vessels of up to  cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately bcf d 
cheniere partners is developing natural gas liquefaction facilities the liquefaction project at the sabine pass lng terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities through a wholly owned subsidiary  sabine pass liquefaction  llc sabine pass liquefaction 
we plan to construct up to six trains each in sequence  train  train  train  train  train and train  which are in various stages of development 
each train has a nominal production capacity of approximately mmtpa 
we also own and operate the creole trail pipeline  which interconnects the sabine pass lng terminal with natural gas markets in north america 
approximately one half of the receiving capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal is contracted to two multinational energy companies 
one of our subsidiaries  cheniere marketing  llc cheniere marketing  is marketing lng and natural gas on its own behalf and on behalf of cheniere partners  in an effort to monetize the other half of the lng receiving capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal during construction of the liquefaction project 
we are in various stages of developing other projects  including lng terminal and associated pipeline related projects  each of which  among other things  will require acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make a final investment decision 
overview of significant events our significant accomplishments since january  and through the filing date of this form k  include the following cheniere we repaid or converted to equity all of our debt  excluding debt of cheniere partners subsidiaries  we raised approximately billion of net proceeds from certain equity offerings  which we used for general corporate purposes  repayment of debt  and to invest in the liquefaction project  we entered into a unit purchase agreement cei unit purchase agreement with cheniere partners  pursuant to which we purchased in a series of transactions from cheniere partners million class b units in the aggregate at a price of per unit for total consideration of million  which has been used by cheniere partners to fund part of the equity portion of the costs of developing  constructing and placing into service the liquefaction project  and the department of energy doe granted us authority to export bcf per year of domestically produced lng to free trade agreement fta countries from the proposed corpus christi liquefaction lng terminal

we expect the cash needs for cheniere partners operating activities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months will be met through operating cash flows from sabine pass lng  existing unrestricted cash  project debt and equity financings 
we expect the cash needs of cheniere operating activities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months will be met by utilizing existing unrestricted cash  management fees from cheniere partners  distributions from our investment in cheniere partners and operating cash flows from our pipeline and lng and natural gas marketing businesses 
the following table presents in thousands cheniere restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents for each portion of our capital structure as of december  all restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held by cheniere partners and sabine pass lng are considered restricted as to usage or withdrawal by cheniere sabine pass lng cheniere partners other cheniere consolidated cheniere cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and cash equivalents total all cash and cash equivalents presented above for sabine pass lng are considered restricted to us  but million is considered unrestricted for sabine pass lng 
all cash and cash equivalents presented above for cheniere partners are considered restricted to us  but million is considered unrestricted for cheniere partners  including the million considered unrestricted for sabine pass lng 
subsequent to december   sabine pass liquefaction issued the sabine liquefaction notes 
the  million net proceeds are considered restricted to us and cheniere partners 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million available to cheniere 
in addition  we had consolidated restricted cash and cash equivalents of million which included cash and cash equivalents and other working capital available to cheniere partners  in which we own a interest  and sabine pass lng designated for the following purposes million for the liquefaction project and for cheniere partners working capital  million for interest payments related to the sabine pass lng senior secured notes described below  million for sabine pass lng working capital  and million for other restricted purposes 
cheniere partners our ownership interest in the sabine pass lng terminal is held through cheniere partners 
we own approximately of cheniere partners in the form of million common units  million class b units  million subordinated units and a general partner interest 
cheniere partners owns a interest in sabine pass lng  which is operating the sabine pass lng terminal  and a interest in sabine pass liquefaction  which is constructing the liquefaction project 
we receive quarterly equity distributions from cheniere partners  and we receive management fees for managing sabine pass lng  sabine pass liquefaction and cheniere partners 
for the year ended december   we received million in distributions on our common units  no cash distributions on our subordinated units or class b units and million in distributions on our general partner interest

cheniere partners common unit and general partner distributions are being funded from accumulated operating surplus 
we have not received distributions on our subordinated units since the distribution made with respect to the quarter ended march  cheniere partners will not make distributions on our subordinated units unless it generates additional cash flow from sabine pass lng excess capacity or new business 
therefore  distributions to us on our subordinated units and conversion of the subordinated units into common units will depend upon the future business development of cheniere partners 
we expect that additional cash flows generated by the liquefaction project or other new cheniere partners business would be used to make quarterly distributions on our subordinated units before any increase in distributions to the common unitholders 
our class b units are subject to conversion  mandatorily or at our option under specified circumstances  into a number of common units based on the then applicable conversion value of the class b units

cheniere partners has guaranteed the obligations of sabine pass liquefaction under its tua and the obligations of cheniere investments under the tura 
in september  sabine pass liquefaction entered into a partial tua assignment agreement with total  whereby sabine pass liquefaction will progressively gain access to total capacity and other services provided under total tua with sabine pass lng 
this agreement will provide sabine pass liquefaction with additional berthing and storage capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal that may be used to accommodate the development of train and train  provide increased flexibility in managing lng cargo loading and unloading activity starting with the commencement of commercial operations of train  and permit sabine pass liquefaction to more flexibly manage its lng storage capacity with the commencement of train notwithstanding any arrangements between total and sabine pass liquefaction  payments required to be made by total to sabine pass lng shall continue to be made by total to sabine pass lng in accordance with its tua 
under each of these tuas  sabine pass lng is entitled to retain of the lng delivered to the sabine pass lng terminal 
liquefaction facilities the liquefaction project is being developed at the sabine pass lng terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities 
we plan to construct up to six trains  which are in various stages of development 
we have commenced construction of train and train and the related new facilities needed to treat  liquefy  store and export natural gas 
construction of train and train and the related facilities is expected to commence upon  among other things  obtaining financing commitments sufficient to fund construction of such trains and making a positive final investment decision 
we recently began the development of train and train and expect to commence the regulatory approval process in the first half of the trains are being designed  constructed and commissioned by bechtel using the conocophillips optimized cascade technology  a proven technology deployed in numerous lng projects around the world 
sabine pass liquefaction has entered into lump sum turnkey contracts for the engineering  procurement and construction of train and train the epc contract train and and train and train the epc contract train and  and together with the epc contract train and  the epc contracts  with bechtel in november and december  respectively 
in august  we received a final order from the doe to export mmtpa of lng to all nations with which trade is permitted 
in april  we received authorization from the ferc to site  construct and operate train  train  train and train as of december   the overall project completion for train and train was approximately complete 
based on our current construction schedule  we anticipate that train will produce lng as early as the end of customers as of february   sabine pass liquefaction has entered into the following third party spas bg gulf coast lng  llc bg spa commences upon the date of first commercial delivery for train and includes an annual contract quantity of  mmbtu of lng and a fixed fee of per mmbtu and includes additional annual contract quantities of  mmbtu   mmbtu  and  mmbtu upon the date of first commercial delivery for train  train and train  respectively  with a fixed fee of per mmbtu 
the total expected annual contracted cash flow from bg from the fixed fee component is million 
in addition  sabine pass liquefaction has agreed to make lng available to bg to the extent that train becomes commercially operable prior to the beginning of the first delivery window 
the obligations of bg are guaranteed by bg energy holdings limited  a company organized under the laws of england and wales  with a credit rating of a a

in addition  cheniere marketing has entered into an spa to purchase  at its option  any excess lng produced that is not committed to non affiliate parties  for up to a maximum of  mmbtu per annum produced from train through train cheniere marketing may purchase incremental lng volumes at a price of of henry hub plus up to per mmbtu for the first  mmbtu of the most profitable cargoes sold each year by cheniere marketing  and then of net profits of the remaining  mmbtu sold each year by cheniere marketing 
construction in november  sabine pass liquefaction entered into the epc contract train and with bechtel 
sabine pass liquefaction issued a notice to proceed for construction under the epc contract train and in august in december  sabine pass liquefaction entered into the epc contract train and with bechtel 
under the epc contract train and  if sabine pass liquefaction fails to issue notice to proceed to bechtel by december   then either sabine pass liquefaction or bechtel may terminate the epc contract train and  and bechtel will be paid costs reasonably incurred on account of such termination and a lump sum of million 
the trains are in various stages of development  as described above 
the total contract price of the epc contract train and is approximately billion  reflecting amounts incurred under change orders through december  total expected capital costs for train and train are estimated to be between billion and billion before financing costs  including estimated owner costs and contingencies 
budgeted total all in costs for train and train are estimated to be between billion and billion  including financing costs and interest expense during construction 
the contract price of the epc contract train and is billion  only subject to adjustment by change order including if sabine pass liquefaction issues the notice to proceed after june  
the cost to construct train and train is currently estimated to be between billion and billion before financing costs  including estimated owner costs and contingencies 
the liquefaction technology to be employed under the epc contracts is the conocophillips optimized cascade process  which was first used at the conocophillips petroleum kenai plant built by bechtel in in kenai  alaska 
bechtel has since designed and or constructed lng facilities using the conocophillips optimized cascade technology in angola  australia  egypt  equatorial guinea and trinidad 
the design and technology has been proven in over four decades of operation 
sabine pass liquefaction trains will require significant amounts of capital to construct and operate and are subject to risks and delays in completion 
even if successfully completed  train is not expected to operate and generate significant cash flows before the end of we currently expect that sabine pass liquefaction capital resources requirements with respect to train and train will be financed through borrowings  equity contributions from cheniere partners and cash flows under our spas 
we believe that with the net proceeds of borrowings  in addition to construction loans and unfunded commitments under the liquefaction credit facility  sabine pass liquefaction will have adequate financial resources available to complete train and train and to meet its currently anticipated capital  operating and debt service requirements 
we currently project that sabine pass liquefaction will generate cash flow from operations by the end of  when train is anticipated to achieve initial lng production  and that such cash flow will be sufficient to meet sabine pass liquefaction ongoing capital and operating requirements and to pay the interest on its outstanding debt relating to train and train pipeline facilities cheniere creole trail pipeline  lp creole trail  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cheniere  owns the creole trail pipeline  a mile pipeline interconnecting the sabine pass lng terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines  including natural gas pipeline company of america  transcontinental gas pipeline corporation  tennessee gas pipeline company  florida gas transmission company  texas eastern gas transmission  and trunkline gas company  as well as the intrastate pipeline system of bridgeline holdings  lp sabine pass liquefaction has entered into a transportation precedent agreement to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity with creole trail and two other pipelines for train and train creole trail filed an application with the ferc in april for certain modifications to allow the creole trail pipeline to be able to transport natural gas to the sabine pass lng terminal 
we estimate the capital costs to modify the creole trail pipeline will be approximately million 
the modifications are expected to be in service in time for the commissioning and testing of train and train we have entered into an agreement with cheniere partners to sell the equity interests of the entities that own the creole trail pipeline if  among other things  cheniere partners obtains acceptable financing for the purchase price 
the consideration to be paid by cheniere partners for the creole trail pipeline is million class b units and million  plus any costs incurred by creole trail from august until the sale date  including  if applicable  any portion of the expected million for pipeline modifications

subject to approval by sabine pass liquefaction lenders  sabine pass liquefaction currently intends to use such suspended commitments to finance the construction of train and train corpus christi lng terminal liquefaction facilities in september  we formed corpus christi liquefaction  llc corpus christi liquefaction to develop an lng terminal near corpus christi on over  acres of land that we own or control 
as currently contemplated  the proposed corpus christi liquefaction lng terminal would be designed for up to three trains with aggregate nominal production capacity up to mmtpa of lng  have three lng storage tanks with capacity of bcfe and two docs that can accommodate vessels of up to  cubic meters the corpus liquefaction project 
in december  corpus christi liquefaction received approval from the ferc to begin the national environmental policy act nepa pre filing process required to seek authorization to commence construction of the corpus liquefaction project 
in august  corpus christi liquefaction filed an application with the ferc for authorization to site  construct and operate the corpus liquefaction project 
simultaneously  cheniere marketing filed an application with the doe to export up to mmtpa of domestically produced lng to fta and non fta countries from the proposed corpus liquefaction project 
in october  the doe granted cheniere marketing authority to export mmtpa of domestically produced lng to fta countries from the proposed corpus liquefaction project 
we will contemplate making a final investment decision to commence construction of the corpus liquefaction project based upon  among other things  entering into acceptable commercial arrangements  receiving regulatory authorization from the ferc to construct and operate the liquefaction assets  securing pipeline transportation of natural gas to the corpus liquefaction project and obtaining adequate financing to construct the facility 
pipeline facilities in conjunction with the corpus liquefaction project  we filed an application with the ferc in august for authorization to site  construct and operate miles of pipeline that would interconnect the corpus liquefaction project with approximately bcf d of natural gas interconnect capacity the corpus christi pipeline 
the pipeline is designed to transport bcf d of feed and fuel gas required by the corpus liquefaction project from the existing intra and interstate natural gas pipeline grid 
we will contemplate making a final investment decision to commence construction of the corpus christi pipeline based upon  among other things  a final investment decision of the corpus christi lng terminal  receiving regulatory authorization from the ferc to construct and operate the pipeline and obtaining adequate financing 
other lng terminal sites we continue to evaluate  and may develop  additional sites that we believe may be commercially desirable locations for lng terminals and other facilities 
lng and natural gas marketing business our wholly owned subsidiary  cheniere marketing  is engaged in the lng and natural gas marketing business and is seeking to develop a portfolio of long term  short term and spot lng purchase and sale agreements  assist cheniere investments in negotiating with potential customers to monetize bcf d of regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal to which it has access under the tura during construction of the liquefaction project  and enter into business relationships for the domestic marketing of natural gas imported by cheniere marketing as lng to the sabine pass lng terminal 
cheniere marketing has been purchasing  transporting and unloading commercial lng cargoes into the sabine pass lng terminal and has used trading strategies intended to maximize margins on these cargoes 
in addition  cheniere marketing has continued to enter into various business relationships to facilitate purchasing and selling commercial lng cargoes 
in an effort to monetize cheniere investments reserved capacity under its tura during construction of the liquefaction project  cheniere marketing has entered into the vcra pursuant to which cheniere marketing is obligated to pay cheniere investments of the expected gross margin of each cargo of lng that cheniere marketing arranges for delivery to the sabine pass lng terminal 
to the extent payments from cheniere marketing to cheniere investments under the vcra or new cheniere partners business increase cheniere partners available cash in excess of the common unit and general partner distributions and certain reserves  the cash would be distributed to cheniere in the form of distributions on cheniere s subordinated units and related general partner distributions 
during the term of the vcra  cheniere marketing is responsible for the payment of taxes and new regulatory costs under cheniere investments assigned tua 
cheniere has guaranteed all of cheniere marketing payment obligations under the vcra 
as described above  cheniere marketing has entered into an spa to purchase  at its option  any excess lng produced that is not committed to non affiliate parties  for up to a maximum of  mmbtu per annum produced from train through train the accounting treatment for lng inventory differs from the treatment for derivative positions such that the economics of cheniere marketing activities are not transparent in our consolidated financial statements until all lng inventory is sold and all derivative positions are settled 
our lng inventory is recorded as an asset at cost and is subject to lower of cost or market lcm adjustments at the end of each reporting period 
the lcm adjustment market price is based on period end natural gas spot prices  and any gain or loss from an lcm adjustment is recorded in our earnings at the end of each period 
revenue and cost of goods sold are not recognized in our earnings until the lng is sold 
generally  our unrealized derivatives positions at the end of each period extend into the future to hedge the cash flow from future sales of our lng inventory or to take market positions and hedge exposure associated with lng and natural gas 
these positions are measured at fair value  and we record the gains and losses from the change in their fair value currently in earnings 
thus  earnings from changes in the fair value of our derivatives may not be offset by losses from lcm adjustments to our lng inventory because the lcm adjustments that may be made to lng inventory are based on period end spot prices that are different from the time periods of the prices used to determine the fair value of our derivatives 
any losses from changes in the fair value of our derivatives will not be offset by gains until the lng is actually sold 
corporate and other activities we are required to maintain corporate general and administrative functions to serve our business activities described above

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material affect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
inflation and changing prices during the years ended december   and  inflation and changing commodity prices have had an impact on our oil and gas revenues but have not significantly impacted our results of operations 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to apply the accounting rules to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we endeavor to comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe that the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical 
however  not all situations are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in these cases  we must use our best judgment to adopt a policy for accounting for these situations 
we accomplish this by analogizing to similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them 
cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
our investments are primarily in commercial paper and are made in accordance with corporate policy  which  among other things  stipulates minimum acceptable credit ratings of commercial paper issuers 
accounting for lng activities generally  we begin capitalizing the costs of our lng terminals and related pipelines once the individual project meets the following criteria i regulatory approval has been received  ii financing for the project is available and iii management has committed to commence construction 
prior to meeting these criteria  most of the costs associated with a project are expensed as incurred 
these costs primarily include professional fees associated with front end engineering and design work  costs of securing necessary regulatory approvals  and other preliminary investigation and development activities related to our lng terminals and related pipelines 
generally  costs that are capitalized prior to a project meeting the criteria otherwise necessary for capitalization include land and lease option costs that are capitalized as property  plant and equipment and certain permits that are capitalized as intangible lng assets 
the costs of lease options are amortized over the life of the lease once obtained 
if no lease is obtained  the costs are expensed 
we capitalize interest and other related debt costs during the construction period of our lng terminal 
upon commencement of operations  capitalized interest  as a component of the total cost  will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
revenue recognition lng regasification capacity reservation fees are recognized as revenue over the term of the respective tuas 
advance capacity reservation fees are initially deferred and amortized over a year period as a reduction of a customer s regasification capacity reservation fees payable under its tua 
the retained of lng delivered for each customer s account at the sabine pass lng terminal is recognized as revenues as sabine pass lng performs the services set forth in each customer s tua 
lng and natural gas marketing we have determined that our lng and natural gas marketing business activities are energy trading and risk management activities for trading purposes and have elected to present these activities on a net basis on our consolidated statements of operations 
marketing and trading revenues represent the margin earned on the purchase and transportation of lng purchases and subsequent sales of natural gas to third parties 
these energy trading and risk management activities include  but are not limited to purchase of lng and natural gas  transportation contracts  and derivatives 
below is a brief description of our accounting treatment of each type of energy trading and risk management activity and how we account for it purchase of lng and natural gas the purchase value of lng or natural gas inventory is recorded as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets at the cost to acquire the product 
our inventory is subject to lower of cost or market adjustment each quarter 
recoveries of losses resulting from interim period lower of cost or market adjustments are made due to market price recoveries on the same inventory in the same fiscal year and are recognized as gains in later interim periods with such gains not exceeding previously recognized losses 
any adjustment to our inventory is recorded on a net basis as lng and natural gas marketing revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
transportation contracts we enter into transportation contracts with respect to the transport of lng or natural gas to a specific location for storage or sale 
transportation costs that are incurred during the purchase of lng or natural gas are capitalized as part of the acquisition costs of the product 
transportation costs incurred to sell lng or natural gas are recorded on a net basis as lng and natural gas marketing revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
lng inventory derivatives we use derivative instruments to hedge cash flows attributable to the future sale of lng inventory 
gains and losses in positions to hedge the cash flows attributable to the future sale of lng inventory are classified as marketing and trading revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
derivatives we use derivative instruments from time to time to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to the future sale of our lng inventory  to hedge the exposure to price risk attributable to future purchases of natural gas to be utilized as fuel to operate the sabine pass lng terminal  and to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating rate interest payments under the liquefaction credit facility 
we have disclosed certain information regarding these derivative positions  including the fair value of our derivative positions  in 
note financial instruments of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
we record changes in the fair value of our derivative positions based on the value for which the derivative instrument could be exchanged between willing parties 
to date  all of our derivative positions fair value determinations have been made by management using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities 
the ultimate fair value of our derivative instruments is uncertain  and we believe that it is possible that a change in the estimated fair value will occur in the near future as commodity prices and interest rates change 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
gains and losses in positions to hedge the cash flows attributable to the future sale of lng inventory are classified as marketing and trading revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
gains or losses in the positions to mitigate the price risk from future purchases of natural gas to be utilized as fuel to operate the sabine pass lng terminal are classified as derivative gain loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
we have elected cash flow hedge accounting for derivatives that we use to hedge the exposure to volatility in floating rate interest payments 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets 
we reclassify gains and losses on the hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations as the hedged item is recognized 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized immediately as derivative gain loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
we use regression analysis to determine whether we expect a derivative to be highly effective as a cash flow hedge prior to electing hedge accounting and also to determine whether all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges have been effective 
we perform these effectiveness tests prior to designation for all new hedges and on a quarterly basis for all existing hedges 
we calculate the actual amount of ineffectiveness on our cash flow hedges using the dollar offset method  which compares changes in the expected cash flows of the hedged transaction to changes in the value of expected cash flows from the hedge 
we discontinue hedge accounting when our effectiveness tests indicate that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  when the hedged item matures  is sold or repaid  or when we determine that the occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction is not probable 
when we discontinue hedge accounting but continue to hold the derivative  we begin to apply mark to market accounting at that time 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and cash equivalents  restricted certificates of deposit  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments 
we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 
we maintain cash balances at financial institutions  which may at times be in excess of federally insured levels 
we have not incurred losses related to these balances to date 
the use of derivative instruments exposes us to counterparty credit risk  or the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet its commitments 
our commodity derivative transactions are executed through over the counter contracts which are subject to nominal credit risk as these transactions are settled on a daily margin basis with investment grade financial institutions 
collateral deposited for such contracts is recorded as an other current asset and not netted within the derivative fair value 
our interest rate derivative instruments are placed with investment grade financial institutions whom we believe are acceptable credit risks 
we monitor counterparty creditworthiness on an ongoing basis  however  we cannot predict sudden changes in counterparties creditworthiness 
in addition  even if such changes are not sudden  we may be limited in our ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk 
should one of these counterparties not perform  we may not realize the benefit of some of our derivative instruments 
sabine pass lng has entered into certain long term tuas with unaffiliated third parties for regasification capacity at our sabine pass lng terminal 
we are dependent on the respective counterparties creditworthiness and their willingness to perform under their respective tuas 
we have mitigated this credit risk by securing tuas for a significant portion of our regasification capacity with creditworthy third party customers with a minimum standard poor s rating of aa 
regulated natural gas pipelines our natural gas pipeline is subject to the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc in accordance with the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of the economic effects of regulation can result in a regulated company recording as assets those costs that have been or are expected to be approved for recovery from customers  or recording as liabilities those amounts that are expected to be required to be returned to customers  in a rate setting process in a period different from the period in which the amounts would be recorded by an unregulated enterprise 
accordingly  we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated rate making process that may not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for non regulated entities 
we continually assess whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities 
based on this continual assessment  we believe the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
these regulatory assets and liabilities are primarily classified in the consolidated balance sheets as other assets and other liabilities 
we periodically evaluate their applicability under gaap  and consider factors such as regulatory changes and the effect of competition 
if cost based regulation ends or competition increases  we may have to reduce our asset balances to reflect a market basis less than cost and write off the associated regulatory assets and liabilities 
items that may influence our assessment are inability to recover cost increases due to rate caps and rate case moratoriums  inability to recover capitalized costs  including an adequate return on those costs through the rate making process and the ferc proceedings  excess capacity  increased competition and discounting in the markets we serve  and impacts of ongoing regulatory initiatives in the natural gas industry 
natural gas pipeline costs include amounts capitalized as an allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
the rates used in the calculation of afudc are determined in accordance with guidelines established by the ferc 
afudc represents the cost of debt and equity funds used to finance our natural gas pipeline additions during construction 
afudc is capitalized as a part of the cost of our natural gas pipelines 
under regulatory rate practices  we generally are permitted to recover afudc  and a fair return thereon  through our rate base after our natural gas pipelines are placed in service 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures for construction activities  major renewals and betterments are capitalized  while expenditures for maintenance and repairs and general and administrative activities are charged to expense as incurred 
interest costs incurred on debt obtained for the construction of property  plant and equipment are capitalized as construction in process over the construction period or related debt term  whichever is shorter 
we depreciate our property  plant and equipment using the straight line depreciation method 
upon retirement or other disposition of property  plant and equipment  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account  and the resulting gains or losses are recorded in operations 
management reviews property  plant and equipment for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment might not be recoverable 
we have recorded no significant impairments related to property  plant and equipment for  or income taxes provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the current period provision for income taxes 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
estimates used in the assessment of impairment of our long lived assets  including goodwill  are the most significant of our estimates 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future cash flows of assets or business segments 
the accuracy of any cash flow estimate is a function of judgment used in determining the amount of cash flows generated 
as a result  cash flows may be different from the cash flows that we use to assess impairment of our assets 
management reviews its estimates of cash flows on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic and commodity price environment 
significant negative industry or economic trends  including a significant decline in the market price of our common stock  reduced estimates of future cash flows for our business segments or disruptions to our business could lead to an impairment charge of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance 
projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from results 
in addition  if our analysis results in an impairment of our long lived assets  including goodwill  we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during a period in which such impairment is determined to exist  which may negatively impact our results of operations 
other items subject to estimates and assumptions include asset retirement obligations  valuation allowances for net deferred tax assets  valuations of derivative instruments  valuations of noncash compensation and collectability of accounts receivable and other assets 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined accurately  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of the assets of businesses acquired 
the goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and is associated with our lng terminal reporting unit 
we determine our reporting units by identifying each unit that engaged in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses  had operating results regularly reviewed by the entities chief operating decision makers for purposes of resource allocation and performance assessment  and had discrete financial information 
goodwill is assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment of the carrying value of goodwill is likely  but no less often than annually 
during the fourth quarters of and  we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill in accordance with fasb guidance which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
the annual reviews of goodwill in and did not result in impairment charges 
the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value for both periods and it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our lng terminal segment was less than its carrying value 
as discussed above regarding our use of estimates  our judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management s estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting unit s fair value 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels of impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements 
debt issuance costs debt issuance costs consist primarily of arrangement fees  professional fees  legal fees and printing costs 
these costs are capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt facility 
share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line or accelerated basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we believe that implied volatility  calculated based on traded options of our common stock  combined with historical volatility is an appropriate indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends 
therefore  the expected volatility for the years ended december  and used in our fair value model was based on a combination of implied and historical volatilities 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  future share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period see

net loss per share net loss per share eps is computed in accordance with gaap 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted eps reflects potential dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued 
basic and diluted eps for all periods presented are the same since the effect of our options and unvested stock is anti dilutive to our net loss per share 
stock options  warrants and unvested stock representing securities that could potentially dilute basic eps in the future that were not included in the diluted computation because they would have been anti dilutive for the years  and  were million shares  million shares and million shares  respectively 
common shares of million on a weighted average basis  issuable upon conversion of the loans and the convertible senior unsecured notes described in 
note debt and debt related parties  were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for and  because the computation of diluted net loss per share utilizing the if converted method would be anti dilutive 
no adjustments were made to reported net loss in the computation of eps 
asset retirement obligations we recognize asset retirement obligations aros for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset and for conditional aros in which the timing or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control 
the fair value of a liability for an aro is recognized in the period in which it is incurred  if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset 
this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset 
our recognition of asset retirement obligations is described below currently  the sabine pass lng terminal is our only constructed and operating lng terminal 
based on the real property lease agreements at the sabine pass lng terminal  at the expiration of the term of the leases we are required to surrender the lng terminal in good working order and repair  with normal wear and tear and casualty expected 
our property lease agreements at the sabine pass lng terminal have terms of up to years including renewal options 
we have determined that the cost to surrender the sabine pass lng terminal in good order and repair  with normal wear and tear and casualty expected  is zero 
therefore  we have not recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with the sabine pass lng terminal 
currently  the creole trail pipeline is our only constructed and operating natural gas pipeline 
we believe that it is not feasible to predict when the natural gas transportation services provided by the creole trail pipeline will no longer be utilized 
in addition  our right of way agreements associated with the creole trail pipeline have no stipulated termination dates 
therefore  we have concluded that due to advanced technology associated with current natural gas pipelines and our intent to operate the creole trail pipeline as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists in the united states  we have not recorded an aro associated with the creole trail pipeline 
recent accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that further addresses fair value measurement accounting and related disclosure requirements

the guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective for periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  as it only expanded disclosures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash investments we have cash investments that we manage based on internal investment guidelines that emphasize liquidity and preservation of capital 
such cash investments are stated at historical cost  which approximates fair market value on our consolidated balance sheets 
marketing and trading commodity price risk we have entered into certain instruments to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to the future sale of our lng inventory lng inventory derivatives and to hedge the exposure to price risk attributable to future purchases of natural gas to be utilized as fuel to operate the sabine pass lng terminal fuel derivatives 
we use one day value at risk var with a confidence interval and other methodologies for market risk measurement and control purposes of our lng inventory derivatives and fuel derivatives 
the var is calculated using the monte carlo simulation method

in order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the interest rate derivatives to changes in interest rates  management modeled a change in the forward month libor curve across the full year term of the interest rate derivatives 
this change in interest rates resulted in a change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives of million
