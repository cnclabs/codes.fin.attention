critical accounting policies ameris has established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
we believe the following accounting policies applied by ameris represent critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses we believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment  assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses  consideration of subjective environmental factors and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans 

table of contents 
index to financial statements management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
considering current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations  management considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income 
certain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
an improving economy could result in the expansion of businesses and creation of jobs which would positively affect our loan growth and improve our gross revenue stream 
conversely  certain factors could result from an expanding economy which could increase our credit costs and adversely impact our net earnings 
a significant rapid rise in interest rates could create higher borrowing costs and shrinking corporate profits which could have a material impact on a borrower s ability to pay 
we will continue to concentrate on maintaining a high quality loan portfolio through strict administration of our loan policy 
another factor that we have considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses is loan concentrations to individual borrowers or industries 
at december   we had one non covered loan that exceeded our in house credit limit of million 
total exposure resulting from this loan is million 
additional disclosure concerning the company s largest loan relationships is provided below 
a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is in the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors 
those loans are secured by real estate in our primary market areas 
a substantial portion of oreo is located in those same markets 
therefore  the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio and the recoverability of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of oreo are susceptible to changes to market conditions in our primary market area 
fair value accounting estimates gaap requires the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities  as well as for specific disclosures 
the most significant include impaired loans  oreo  and the net assets acquired in business combinations 
certain of these assets do not have a readily available market to determine fair value and require an estimate based on specific parameters 
when market prices are unavailable  we determine fair values utilizing estimates  which are constantly changing  including interest rates  duration  prepayment speeds and other specific conditions 
in most cases  these specific parameters require a significant amount of judgment by management 
at december   the percentage of the company s assets measured at fair value was 
see note  fair value of financial instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
when a loan is considered impaired  a specific valuation allowance is allocated  if necessary  so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
in addition  foreclosed assets are carried at the net realizable value  following foreclosure 
the company s impaired loans and foreclosed property are concentrated in markets and areas where the determination of fair value through market research recent sales and or qualified appraisals is difficult 
accordingly  the determination of fair value in the current environment is difficult and more subjective than it would be in traditionally stable real estate environments 
although management believes its processes for determining the value of these assets are appropriate and allow ameris to arrive at a fair value  the processes require management judgment and assumptions and the value of such assets at the time they are revalued or divested may be different from management s determination of fair value 

table of contents 
index to financial statements business combinations assets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value 
the fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities 
on the date of acquisition  when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments  the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non accretable difference 
the company must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date 
subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses 
subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income 
in addition  purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are also handled under this method 
income taxes gaap requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as gains on fdic assisted transactions and the provision for loan losses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provisions in the statement of income 
we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheet net deferred tax liabilities of million as of december  deferred gains on fdic assisted transactions represent the company s largest deferred tax liability  totaling million 
allowances for loan losses associated with loans where no loss has yet been recorded for tax purposes represent the company s largest deferred tax asset  totaling million 
long lived assets  including intangibles during  the bank recorded new goodwill totaling  related to the acquisition of tbc 
no goodwill was expensed or amortized during or in accordance with gaap 
at december   the company s balance of intangible assets totaled million and is being amortized over its previously determined useful life

the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on non accruing  past due and other loans that management believes might be potentially impaired or warrant additional attention 
we segregate our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilize this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio 
in addition  based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent loan reviewers and regulatory authorities  we further segregate our loan portfolio by loan grades based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans 
certain reviewed loans are assigned specific allowances when a review of relevant data determines that a general allocation is not sufficient or when the review affords management the opportunity to fine tune the amount of exposure in a given credit 
in establishing allowances  management considers historical loan loss experience but adjusts this data with a significant emphasis on data such as current loan quality trends  current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the bank operates 
factors considered include among others  current valuations of real estate in our markets  unemployment rates  the effect of weather conditions on agricultural related entities and other significant local economic events  such as major plant closings 
we have developed a methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses which is monitored by the company s senior credit officer 
procedures provide for the assignment of a risk rating for every loan included in our total loan portfolio  with the exception of credit card receivables and overdraft protection loans which are treated as pools for risk rating purposes 
the risk rating schedule provides nine ratings of which five ratings are classified as pass ratings and four ratings are classified as criticized ratings 
each risk rating is assigned a percent factor to be applied to the loan balance to determine the adequate amount of allowance 
many of the larger loans require an annual review by an independent loan officer and are often reviewed by independent third parties 
as a result of these loan reviews  certain loans may be assigned specific allowance allocations 
other loans that surface as problem loans may also be assigned specific allowance allocations 
past due loans are assigned risk ratings based on the number of days past due 
the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  including underlying data and assumptions  is reviewed regularly by the company s chief financial officer as well as the director of internal audit

index to financial statements nonperforming loans a loan is placed on non accrual status when  in management s judgment  the collection of the interest income appears doubtful 
interest receivable that has been accrued in prior years and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectability is charged to the allowance for possible loan losses 
interest on loans that are classified as non accrual is recognized when received 
past due loans are placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms 
the following table presents an analysis of non covered loans accounted for on a non accrual basis 
december  dollars in thousands commercial  financial agricultural real estate construction development real estate commercial farmland real estate residential consumer installment loans total loans contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing during and  loans tied to the housing industry acquisition  development and construction loans came under severe strain as housing prices fell sharply and sales activity slowed 
certain markets  where housing prices had risen sharply in recent years  suffered greater corrections than others 
the company s exposure to certain housing related loans primarily in northern florida and coastal georgia and south carolina resulted in deteriorating credit quality and caused most of the increase in non accrual loans shown above 
as the deterioration in the real estate market slowed and indications of recovery in these markets emerged during the second half of  our levels of non accrual loans have seen improvement 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers  who may be either depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs  and the ability of our company to meet those needs 
we seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short term investments principally interest bearing deposits in banks and monthly amortizing loans 
another source of liquidity is the repayment of maturing single payment loans 
in addition  our company maintains relationships with correspondent banks  including the fhlb and the federal reserve bank of atlanta  which could provide funds on short notice  if needed 
a principal objective of our asset liability management strategy is to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of our asset and liability committee the alco committee which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 
as part of our interest rate risk management policy  the alco committee examines the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and monitors its interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 

table of contents 
index to financial statements a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  the alco committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we manage the mix of asset and liability maturities in an effort to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income 
except for its effect on the general level of interest rates  inflation does not have a material impact on the balance sheet due to the rate variability and short term maturities of its earning assets 
in particular  approximately of earning assets mature or reprice within one year or less 
mortgage loans  generally our loan with the longest maturity  are usually made with five to fifteen year maturities  but with either a variable interest rate or a fixed rate with an adjustment between origination date and maturity date 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates

the weighted average yield for each maturity range was computed using the acquisition price of each security in that range 
yields on securities of state and political subdivisions are stated on a taxable equivalent basis  using a tax rate of 
the investment portfolio consists of securities which are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of the related deferred tax effect 
the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest method over the life of the securities 
realized gains and losses  determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold  are included in earnings on the settlement date 
declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
the company s methodology for determining whether other than temporary impairment losses exist include management considering i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and iii the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
substantially all of the unrealized losses on debt securities are related to changes in interest rates and do not affect the expected cash flows of the issuer or underlying collateral 
all unrealized losses are considered temporary because each security carries an acceptable investment grade  the company has the intent and ability to hold such securities until maturity and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery or maturity 
the company s investments in subordinated debt include investments in regional and super regional banks on which the company conducts regular analysis through review of financial information or credit ratings 
investments in preferred securities are also concentrated in the preferred obligations of regional and super regional banks through non pooled investment structures 
the company did not hold any investments in pooled trust preferred securities at december

volatile deposits  in management s opinion  are those deposit accounts that are overly rate sensitive and apt to move if our rate offerings are not at or near the top of the market 
generally speaking  these are brokered deposits or time deposits in amount greater than  the amounts of time certificates of deposit issued in amounts of  or more as of december   are shown below by category  which is based on time remaining until maturity of i three months or less  ii over three through twelve months and iii greater than one year

generally  these commitments to extend credit have been granted on a temporary basis for seasonal or inventory requirements and have been approved by the bank s local boards 
our bank has also granted commitments to approved customers for financial standby letters of credit 
these commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable 
the bank uses the same credit policies for these off balance sheet commitments as it does for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitment amounts expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  we manage exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as trading 
finally  we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk or other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
our policy is to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
as indicated by the gap analysis included in this annual report  we are somewhat liability sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates 
being liability sensitive would result in net interest income decreasing in a rising rate environment and increasing in a declining rate environment 
we use simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining and flat interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a gradual basis points increase or basis points decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
our most recent model projects net interest income would decrease slightly if rates rise basis points gradually over the next year 
a scenario involving a basis points decrease is irrelevant at this time with current market rates being at or near zero since the last reduction of the federal funds target rate by the federal reserve on december
