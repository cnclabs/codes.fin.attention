item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial information  included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
company overview founded in with a single truck  casella waste systems  inc is a regional  vertically integrated solid waste  recycling and resource management services company 
we provide resource management expertise and services to residential  commercial  municipal and industrial customers  primarily in the areas of solid waste collection  transfer  disposal  recycling and organics services 
we operate in six states vermont  new hampshire  new york  massachusetts  maine and pennsylvania  with our headquarters located in rutland  vermont 
we manage our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through two regional operating segments  the eastern and western regions  each of which includes a full range of solid waste services  and our larger scale recycling operations and commodity brokerage operations through our recycling segment 
ancillary operations  major customer accounts  discontinued operations and earnings from equity method investees are included in our other segment 
as of may   we owned and or operated solid waste collection operations  transfer stations  recycling facilities  nine subtitle d landfills  four landfill gas to energy facilities and one landfill permitted to accept construction and demolition  or c d  materials 
acquisitions and divestitures acquisitions beginning in fiscal year  we put in place a dedicated business development team that identifies acquisition candidates  categorizes the opportunity by strategic fit and perceived level of financial accretion  establishes contact with the appropriate representative of the acquisition candidate and gathers further information on the acquisition candidate 
we have made in the past  and we may make in the future  acquisitions in order to acquire or develop additional disposal capacity 
these acquisitions may include tuck in acquisitions within our existing markets  assets that are adjacent to or outside of our existing markets  or larger  more strategic acquisitions 
in addition  from time to time  we may acquire businesses that are complementary to our core business strategy 
we face considerable competition for acquisition targets  particularly the larger and more meaningful targets  due to among other things our limited access to and weighted average cost of capital  but our strong relationships and reputation in the new england and upstate new york areas help to offset these factors 
during the fiscal year ended april   we acquired six solid waste hauling operations in the western region for total consideration of million  including million in cash and million in holdbacks to the sellers 
we also acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of bbi in the eastern region for total consideration  after recording a working capital adjustment defined in the agreement  of million  including million in cash and approximately million shares of our class a common stock  valued at an aggregate of million 
we recorded an additional million to goodwill for the increased deferred tax liability related to the bbi acquisition based on the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amount recognized for income tax purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further discussion 
the acquisition of bbi  a provider of solid waste collection  transfer and liquid waste services in new hampshire and maine  on december   provides us the opportunity to internalize additional waste and recyclables and to consolidate operations  routes and transportation within the eastern region 
revenue generated from bbi amounted to approximately million from december  through april  in fiscal year  we acquired five solid waste hauling operations 
we also completed the acquisition of the mckean county landfill business in pennsylvania by acquiring additional equipment not included in the original transaction 
these entities and assets were acquired for total consideration of million  including million in cash and million in holdbacks to sellers 
in fiscal year  we acquired two solid waste hauling operations for million in cash and million in notes payable and the mckean county landfill business in pennsylvania in exchange for million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
we acquired the mckean county landfill business out of bankruptcy proceedings and recognized a bargain purchase gain of million based on the amount by which the fair value of assets acquired exceeded the purchase price consideration 

table of contents divestitures from time to time in the future  we may sell or divest certain other components of our business 
these divestitures may be undertaken for a number of reasons  including to generate proceeds to pay down debt  or as a result of a determination that the specified asset will provide inadequate returns to us  or that the asset no longer serves a strategic purpose in connection with our business or if we determine the asset may be more valuable to a third party 
we will continue to look to divest certain activities that do not fit into our long term strategy that no longer enhance or complement our core business if the right opportunity presents itself 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we initiated a plan to dispose of kti bio fuels  inc bio fuels  a construction and demolition material processing facility located in lewiston  maine  and as a result  the assets associated with bio fuels were classified as held for sale and the results of operations were recorded as a loss from discontinued operations 
assets of the disposal group classified as held for sale include certain inventory and plant and equipment 
we recognized a million charge associated with the adjustment of the disposal group to fair value as a loss from discontinued operations 
there are inherent judgments and estimates used in determining impairment charges and the actual sale of a business can result in the recognition of an additional gain or loss 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we executed a purchase and sale agreement with the city of biddeford  maine pursuant to which we agreed to sell the real property of maine energy  which is located in our eastern region  to the city of biddeford  subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent and closing 
we agreed to sell maine energy for undiscounted purchase consideration of million  which shall be paid to us in equal installments over the next years  subject to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement 
the transaction closed in november  and we waived certain conditions precedent not satisfied at that time 
in december  we closed the facility and initiated the decommissioning process in accordance with the provisions of the agreement 
following the decommissioning of maine energy  it is our responsibility to demolish the facility  at our cost  within twelve months of the closing date and in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement 
we initially recorded a charge to loss on divestiture of million in the third quarter of fiscal year as a result of this transaction 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as more information became available  we made revisions to the estimated costs associated with the divestiture  resulting in the reversal of the initial loss on divestiture of million 
we will continue to finalize estimates and get additional information regarding the estimated costs associated with the divestiture 
due to the inherent judgments and estimates regarding the remaining costs to fulfill our obligation under the purchase and sale agreement to demolish the facility and remediate the site  recognition of a loss on divestiture  which we do not expect  or a potential gain on divestiture is possible 
there were no divestitures in fiscal year in fiscal year  we completed the divestiture of our non integrated recycling assets and select intellectual property assets for million in gross proceeds and the sale of the assets of our trilogy glass business for cash proceeds of million 
these transactions resulted in gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations net of tax of million and million  respectively 
the divestiture of our non integrated recycling assets and select intellectual property assets included an estimated million working capital and other purchase price adjustment  which was subject to further adjustment  as defined in the purchase and sale agreement 
the final working capital adjustment  along with additional legal expenses related to the transaction  of million  and an additional working capital adjustment of million  which related to our subsequent collection of receivable balances that were released to us for collection by the purchaser  were recorded as gain on disposal of discontinued operations net of tax in fiscal year in fiscal year  we also completed the sale of certain assets in southeastern massachusetts for a total consideration of million  with cash proceeds of million 
we recorded a gain on sale of assets of million

revenues in our eastern and western regions consist primarily of fees charged to customers for solid waste disposal and collection  landfill  landfill gas to energy  transfer  organics and recycling services 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations 
we also generate and sell electricity at certain of our landfill facilities 
in addition  revenues from our recycling segment consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers

the acquisitions and divestitures change component in total solid waste revenues decline for the fiscal year ended april  is primarily the result of million in increased revenues from acquisitions  primarily associated with the bbi acquisition within the eastern region  partially offset by million in decreased revenues associated with the maine energy divestiture 
the acquisitions and divestitures change component in total solid waste revenues growth for the fiscal year ended april  is the result of million in increased revenues from acquisitions  partially offset by million in decreased revenues associated with the divestiture of certain assets in southeastern massachusetts in fiscal year customer resource solutions and recycling revenues the decrease in crs revenues for the fiscal years ended april  and april  from the previous periods is primarily the result of million and million from volume declines 
the decrease in recycling revenues for the fiscal year ended april  from the previous period is the result of million from unfavorable commodity prices in the marketplace  partially offset by million in commodity volume increases 
the increase in recycling revenues for the fiscal year ended april  from the previous period is primarily the result of favorable commodity prices in the marketplace 
operating expenses cost of operations cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  workers compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties 
cost of operations also includes accretion expense related to landfill capping  closure and post closure  leachate treatment and disposal costs and depletion of landfill operating lease obligations 
our cost of operations expense increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  when comparing the fiscal years ended april  and to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of operations was  and for fiscal years ended april  and  respectively 
the change in our cost of operations during the fiscal year ended april  can largely be attributed to the following third party disposal cost increased million due primarily to increased landfill disposal costs associated with additional volumes from the acquisition of bbi and increased waste to energy disposal costs associated with a diversion of tons to a third party incinerator from one of our landfills 
labor and related benefit costs increased million associated with the acquisition of bbi and an increase in health care costs 
direct operational costs increased million due primarily to higher equipment rental and lease costs associated with an increase in fleet and landfill equipment rentals  depletion of landfill operating lease obligations and a decrease in the gain related to the sale of fixed assets 
hauling costs increased million due primarily to increased transportation costs associated with additional volumes from the acquisition of bbi and a higher volume of organic materials being processed within organics and processing 
the increase in transportation costs associated with bbi and organics and processing was partially offset by reductions in transportation costs associated with lower solid waste collection volumes and the divestiture of maine energy 

table of contents vehicle maintenance costs increased million due to increased fleet maintenance costs and the timing of various maintenance projects within our western region 
direct costs related to purchased materials decreased million associated primarily with lower commodity prices within the marketplace 
the change in our cost of operations during the fiscal year ended april  can largely be attributed to the following hauling costs increased million due to increased transportation costs associated with higher organics and processing volumes and higher disposal volumes related to landfill brokerage services  transfer station activity and transportation services to third party customers 
fuel costs increased million due primarily to higher average fuel prices for the fiscal year ended april  direct operational costs increased million due to higher leachate disposal costs associated with elevated rainfall amounts at our landfills in fiscal year  increased other operating costs associated primarily with a commodities marketing agreement  increased depletion of landfill operating lease obligations and increased landfill operating costs related primarily to engineering and grounds maintenance  offset by decreased host and royalty fees 
direct costs related to purchased materials increased million due to higher recycling commodity prices for much of fiscal year and increased costs of purchased scrap metals 
general and administration general and administration expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  professional services and costs associated with marketing  sales force and community relations efforts 
our general and administration expense decreased million  or  and million  or  respectively  when comparing the fiscal years ended april  and to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administration expense was  and for fiscal years ended april  and  respectively 
the change in our general and administration expense during the fiscal year ended april  can largely be attributed to the following legal and consulting fees decreased million for the fiscal year ended april  due primarily to fewer ongoing legal proceedings  despite million of legal costs associated with the new york state tax litigation matter 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further discussion 
labor  bonus and related benefit costs decreased million for the fiscal year ended april  due to a reduction of salaries and wages associated with the realignment and streamlining of functions to improve our cost structure in the second quarter of fiscal year cost savings were partially offset by increased equity compensation costs  an increase in health care costs and additional personnel costs associated with the bbi acquisition 
other general and administration costs  including travel and entertainment  telephone and advertising  decreased by million for the fiscal year ended april  due primarily to additional cost savings associated with the realignment and streamlining of functions to improve our cost structure in the second quarter of fiscal year the change in our general and administration expense during the fiscal year ended april  can largely be attributed to the following labor and related benefit costs decreased million for the fiscal year ended april  due primarily to a million one time discretionary bonus that was granted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of consumption method  and the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill using the straight line method 
we amortize landfill retirement assets through a charge to cost of operations using a straight line rate per ton as landfill airspace is utilized 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
we amortize or depreciate all fixed and intangible assets  other than goodwill  to a zero net book value  and do not apply a salvage value to any fixed assets 
we capitalize certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs associated directly with the expansion of existing landfills 
additionally  we also capitalize certain third party expenditures related to development projects and pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering costs 
we routinely evaluate all such capitalized costs  and expense those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
we have material financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and disposal facilities 
we have provided accruals for these future financial obligations based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
there can be no assurance that our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds 
our depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  and increased million  or  respectively  when comparing the fiscal years ended april  and to the prior fiscal years 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expense was  and for fiscal years ended april  and  respectively 
in the fiscal year ended april   depreciation expense decreased by million associated largely with the maine energy impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and maine energy s ultimate divestiture in the third quarter of fiscal year  which reduced our depreciable asset base 
this was partially offset by million in increased landfill amortization expense due to increased landfill volumes within the eastern region  primarily at our southbridge landfill  and million in increased amortization expense associated with an increase in our intangible assets due primarily to the bbi acquisition 
in the fiscal year ended april   depreciation expense increased by million due to timing and increased capital expenditures 
this was partially offset by million in decreased landfill amortization expense due primarily to rate changes and waste mix  which more than offset increased volumes 
severance and reorganization costs in the second quarter of fiscal year  we realigned our operations in order to streamline functions and improve our cost structure 
through the reorganization we targeted improvements in certain aspects of the sales function to better facilitate customer service and retention  pricing growth  and support of strategic growth initiatives  better aligned transportation  route management and maintenance functions at the local level  and reduced corporate overhead and staff to match organizational needs and reduce costs 
we recorded a severance and reorganization charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal year with respect to the realignment 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we recorded a million severance charge related primarily to the closing of maine energy  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further discussion  and a reorganization of senior management 
the liability associated with severance and reorganization as of april   which is recorded in other accrued liabilities  is million 
expense from divestiture  acquisition and financing costs the million expense from divestiture  acquisition and financing costs is associated with the following fiscal year events a million write off of costs associated with the attempted refinancing of our senior second lien notes in the first quarter of fiscal year the second lien notes  million of legal costs associated with the maine energy divestiture transaction  and million of costs associated with the bbi acquisition 

table of contents asset impairment charge in fiscal year  we entered into negotiations regarding the sale of maine energy 
based on the proposed purchase consideration  we recorded a million impairment charge to the asset group within the eastern region segment 
the impairment was measured based on the asset group s highest and best use under the market approach  utilizing the discounted present cash flows associated with the purchase consideration  adjusted for costs to demolish the facility 
we used a discount rate of  which approximates the buyer s borrowing rate 
in fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a recycling processing facility  as the fair value of the asset group was determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset group 
the fair value of the asset group was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset group 
the analysis included a determination of an appropriate discount rate  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management 
the discount rate used was commensurate with the risks involved 
legal settlement in the fiscal year ended april   our legal settlement expense increased million due to legal settlements with town of seneca  new york and the vermont attorney general s office 
in fiscal year  we reached settlements with the town of seneca  new york for million and the vermont attorney general s office for million 
development project charge in the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million for deferred costs associated with certain development projects no longer deemed viable 
as of april  and  we had million and million of deferred costs associated with development projects included in other non current assets within our consolidated balance sheets 
environmental remediation charge in fiscal year  we recorded an environmental remediation charge of million associated with changes in expected cash flows for our share of the work associated with a consent order issued by the state of new york to remediate the scrap yard and solid waste transfer station owned by waste stream  inc  a subsidiary of ours in the western region 
bargain purchase gain in fiscal year  we acquired the mckean county landfill business in pennsylvania in exchange for million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
we acquired the mckean county landfill business out of bankruptcy proceedings and recognized a bargain purchase gain of million based on the amount by which the fair value of assets acquired exceeded the purchase price consideration 
gain on sale of assets in fiscal year  we completed the divestiture of the assets of our cape cod  massachusetts operations along with the assets of our rochester  massachusetts transfer station 
total consideration for this sale amounted to million  with cash proceeds of million 
we recorded a gain on this sale of assets of million 
other expenses interest expense  net our interest expense  net decreased million  or  and million  or  respectively  when comparing the fiscal years ended april  and to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenues  interest expense  net was  and for fiscal years ended april  and  respectively 

table of contents the decrease in interest expense  net during the fiscal year ended april  can largely be attributed to lower interest rates associated with the redemption in october and november of of million in aggregate principal balance outstanding second lien notes 
the interest savings related to the redemption were partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with higher average debt balances in fiscal year  associated primarily with borrowings on the amended and restated senior secured revolving credit facility the revolver to redeem the second lien notes and help fund operations and meet cash flow needs  and the conversion from a variable rate to a five year fixed term interest rate of per annum on the million finance authority of maine the authority solid waste disposal revenue bonds series r the converted bonds 
the change in interest expense  net during the fiscal year ended april  can largely be attributed to lower interest rates related to the refinancing of our revolver in march and the offering of our senior subordinated notes due the notes in february interest expense reductions related to lower interest rates in the fiscal year ended april  were partially offset by increased interest expense associated with higher average debt balances in fiscal year loss from equity method investments our loss from equity method investments decreased million and increased million  respectively  when comparing the fiscal years ended april  and to the prior fiscal years 
our equity method investments consist of the following investments greenfiber 
the improvement in fiscal year and the decline in fiscal year were largely due to greenfiber impairing the entire amount of their goodwill in december we recorded our million portion of the impairment charge in fiscal year the operational performance of greenfiber  although improved from fiscal year  has continued to be negatively impacted by the depressed manufactured home market and lack of new home construction 
effective december   we and lp each guaranteed up to million in support of greenfiber s modified and restated loan and security agreement 
the guaranty could be drawn on upon an event of default and remained in place through  either  payment of the associated term loan under the security agreement or december   the extended term of greenfiber s modified and restated loan and security agreement 
in march  we received notification that greenfiber s term loan had been called for redemption due to an event of default 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a liability of million  included in other accrued liabilities  as an investment in greenfiber based on our guaranty 
in may  we and lp each contributed million to greenfiber to satisfy the guaranty and pay off the term loan in full 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
tompkins county we account for our membership interest in tompkins using the equity method of accounting 
our portion of the reported income from tompkins for fiscal years and was immaterial 
impairment of equity method investment in december  greenfiber performed a test for goodwill impairment 
based on the analysis performed  we determined that the current book value of our investment in greenfiber exceeded its fair value 
the analysis calculated greenfiber s fair value based on the income approach using discounted cash flows taking into account current expectations for asset utilization  housing starts and the remaining useful life of related assets 
we recorded a charge of million as impairment on equity method investment in fiscal year loss on debt extinguishment in fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million as a loss on debt extinguishment related to the full refinancing of our second lien notes 
the loss on debt extinguishment consisted of a million non cash write off of deferred financing costs  a million non cash write off of the unamortized original issue discount and a million charge associated with the early tender premium and tender fees associated with the redemption of the second lien notes 
in fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million as a loss on debt extinguishment related to the non cash write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the original issuance by the authority of million aggregate principal amount of its solid waste disposal revenue bonds series the bonds 
on february   we converted the interest rate to a fixed rate through january  using a conversion option  and remarketed  million aggregate principal of the bonds 
in fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million as a loss on debt extinguishment associated with fiscal year refinancing efforts  which included the write off of million and million in deferred financing costs associated with the senior secured term b loan due april  the term loan and the senior subordinated notes due february  the notes  
table of contents the write off of the million discount and million premium associated with the term loan and notes  a million gain associated with the discount on the tender of the notes and a million loss associated with the consent payment on the notes 
also included in this loss is a charge attributable to the million non cash write off of unamortized financing costs associated with the repayment of financing lease obligations and other costs 
benefit provision for income taxes our benefit provision for income taxes from continuing operations decreased million in fiscal year to million from million in fiscal year  and increased million in fiscal year to million from million in fiscal year the change in the provision from fiscal year to is primarily related to a million deferred tax benefit due to a reduction of the valuation allowance in connection with the recording of deferred tax liabilities related to the bbi acquisition  offset by million in current provision related to a settlement with the state of new york for corporate franchise tax for tax years april  through april  the benefit provision for income taxes for fiscal year and includes deferred tax provisions of million and million  respectively  due mainly to the increase in the deferred tax liability for indefinite lived assets 
since we cannot determine when the deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived assets will reverse  this amount cannot be used as a future source of taxable income against which to benefit deferred tax assets 
the variance between fiscal year and primarily results from recognizing in fiscal year the tax benefit for utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets against the gain on the disposal of discontinued operations 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations  net discontinued operations in the fiscal years ended april   and represents the result of operations related to the planned business disposition of bio fuels and two separate transactions completed in fiscal year the sale of the non integrated recycling assets and select intellectual property assets and the sale of the trilogy glass business 
our loss from discontinued operations  net in the fiscal year includes a million loss associated with the adjustment to the carrying value of bio fuels to its fair value as a result of the planned business disposition of bio fuels 
there are inherent judgments and estimates used in determining impairment charges and the actual sale of a business can result in the recognition of an additional gain or loss 
the operating results of the operations discussed above have been included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
loss gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net our gain on disposal of discontinued operations in the fiscal year ended april  was the result of two separate transactions in fiscal year the sale of the non integrated recycling assets and select intellectual property assets and the sale of the trilogy glass business 
we completed the divestiture of our non integrated recycling assets and select intellectual property assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year for million in gross proceeds 
this resulted in a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of million net of tax in fiscal year we completed the sale of the assets of the trilogy glass business for cash proceeds of million 
this resulted in a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million net of tax in fiscal year our gain on disposal of discontinued operations in the fiscal year ended april  was the result of the following an additional working capital adjustment of million net of tax  which related to our subsequent collection of receivable balances that were released to us for collection and a working capital adjustment combined with other legal expenses totaling million net of tax related to the sale of non integrated recycling assets and select intellectual property assets

cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by million and increased by million  respectively  when comparing the fiscal years ended april  and to the prior fiscal year 
the most significant items affecting the change in our operating cash flows for the fiscal year ended april  when compared to the prior fiscal year are summarized below loss from continuing operations 
our loss from continuing operations decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended april  from million for the fiscal year ended april  despite the improvement  our operating performance declined as revenues decreased million from fiscal year  while cost of operations increased million  severance and reorganization costs increased million and expense from divestiture  acquisition and financing costs increased million 
we did experience cost savings within general and administration of million  but this reduction was not able to compensate for the previously mentioned items  resulting in a decrease in cash flow provided by operations 
cash interest payments 
cash interest payments increased million for the fiscal year ended april  due to increased debt levels  the conversion of our bonds from a variable rate to a five year fixed term interest rate of per annum in february and the timing of payments 
changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures 
our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted million in the fiscal year ended april  by changes in our assets and liabilities 
this was due to favorable impacts related to our accounts payable  which were affected by both cost changes and timing of payments  prepaid expenses  inventories and other assets  which were affected primarily by the timing of payments  expense recognition and accounts receivable  which were affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received 
this was partially offset by the unfavorable impact related to accrued expenses and other liabilities  which were affected primarily by cost changes such as interest  the timing of payments  and changes related to accrued capping  closure  and post closure costs 
this is compared to the fiscal year ended april   when our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted million by changes in our assets and liabilities 
the unfavorable change of million is largely due to the unfavorable million impact associated with the change in accounts receivable and the unfavorable million impact associated with the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by the favorable million impact associated with the change in prepaid expenses  inventories and other assets 

table of contents the most significant items affecting the change in our operating cash flows for the fiscal year ended april  when compared to the prior fiscal year are summarized below loss from continuing operations 
our loss from continuing operations increased million to million for the fiscal year ended april  from million for the fiscal year ended april  despite the increase in loss from continuing operations  our revenues increased million and we experienced cost savings within general and administration of million  which more than offset the increased cost of operations of million and the legal settlements of million  resulting in increased cash flows from operations 
cash interest payments 
cash interest payments decreased million for the fiscal year ended april  due to the effect of the timing of payments and lower average interest rates associated with our capital structure 
changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures 
our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted million in the fiscal year ended april  by changes in our assets and liabilities 
this change was driven by favorable impacts related to our accounts receivable  which were affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received  accounts payable  which were affected by both cost changes and timing of payments  and prepaid expenses  inventories and other assets  which were affected primarily by the timing of payments  expense recognition  as well as cost changes 
this favorable change was offset by the unfavorable impact related to accrued expenses and other liabilities  which were affected primarily by cost changes such as interest  the timing of payments  and changes related to accrued capping  closure  and post closure costs 
this is compared to the fiscal year ended april   when our cash flow from operations was unfavorably impacted million by changes in our assets and liabilities 
the favorable change of million is due to the favorable million impact associated with the change in accounts receivable and the favorable million impact associated with the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by the unfavorable million impact associated with the change in accounts payable and the unfavorable million impact associated with the change in prepaid expenses  inventories and other assets 
net cash used in investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities increased by million and million  respectively  when comparing the fiscal years ended april  and to the prior fiscal year 
the most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows for the fiscal year ended april  when compared to the prior fiscal year are summarized below acquisitions  net of cash acquired 
during fiscal year  we acquired six solid waste hauling operations in the western region for total consideration of million  of which we paid million in cash 
we also acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of bbi in the eastern region for total consideration  after recording a working capital adjustment defined in the agreement  of million  of which we paid million in cash 
during fiscal year  we acquired five solid waste hauling operations and completed the acquisition of the mckean county landfill business in pennsylvania by acquiring additional equipment not included in the original transaction for total consideration of million  of which we paid million in cash 
investments in unconsolidated entities 
during the fiscal year  we made investments in unconsolidated entities totaling million compared to million in fiscal year capital expenditures 
lower capital expenditures of million in the fiscal year ended april  related primarily to the timing of projects and a decrease in spending related to the divestiture of maine energy 
the most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows for the fiscal year ended april  when compared to the prior fiscal year are summarized below capital expenditures 
higher capital expenditures of million in the fiscal year ended april  related primarily to recycling facility upgrades  a landfill gas to energy project and fleet replacement 

table of contents payments on landfill operating lease contracts 
higher payments of million for landfill operating lease contracts in the fiscal year ended april  due to the timing of payments 
investments in unconsolidated entities 
during the fiscal year  we made investments in unconsolidated entities totaling million 
we did not make any investments in unconsolidated entities in fiscal year proceeds from the sale of assets 
a decrease of million in cash proceeds  of which the entire amount relates to the sale of certain assets in southeastern massachusetts in the fiscal year ended april  acquisitions  net of cash acquired 
during the fiscal year ended april   we acquired five solid waste hauling operations and completed the acquisition of the mckean county landfill business in pennsylvania by acquiring additional equipment not included in the original transaction for total consideration of million  or which we paid million in cash

the most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows for the fiscal year ended april  when compared to the prior fiscal year are summarized below stock issuance 
we sold million shares of class a common stock through a registered public offering and received net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
debt activity 
we increased debt borrowings by million associated primarily with the offering of million in additional notes  million in vermont bonds  million in new hampshire bonds and additional revolver borrowings 
this more than offset the million in increased debt payments associated primarily with the full redemption of the second lien notes and the paydown of the revolver with proceeds from the issuance of the new hampshire bonds and vermont bonds 
tender premium and costs 
a tender premium and tender costs of million were paid as a part of the redemption of the second lien notes 
payment of financing costs 
we made higher payments of financing costs of million associated primarily with the offering of million in additional notes 
the most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows for the fiscal year ended april  when compared to the prior fiscal year are summarized below debt activity 
decreased debt borrowings of million were more than offset by decreased debt payments of million in the fiscal year ended april  the decrease in long term borrowings is primarily the result of the offering of the notes in fiscal year the decrease in principal payments is primarily the result of the pay down of the senior secured term b loan due april  and the redemption of the notes in fiscal year net cash used in provided by discontinued operations 
cash flows from discontinued operations decreased million and million  respectively  when comparing the fiscal years ended april  and to the prior fiscal year 
these fluctuations in net cash flows from discontinued operations is primarily the result of the planned business disposition of bio fuels and two separate transactions completed in fiscal year the sale of non integrated recycling assets and select intellectual property assets for million in cash proceeds and the sale of the trilogy glass business for million in cash proceeds 
we generally meet liquidity needs from operating cash flow and the revolver 
these liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  debt service costs and capping  closure and post closure expenditures and acquisitions 

table of contents hedging our strategy to hedge against fluctuations in variable interest rates involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates 
in fiscal year  we entered into two forward starting interest rate derivative agreements that were initially being used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted financing transaction to redeem our second lien notes effective january  the total notional amount of these agreements is million and require us to receive interest based on changes in the london interbank offered rate index and pay interest at a rate of approximately 
the agreements mature on march  during the second quarter of fiscal year  we dedesignated both of the million forward starting interest rate derivative agreements and discontinued hedge accounting in accordance with asc because the interest payments associated with the forecasted financing transaction were no longer deemed probable 
we recognized a million loss  reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss  as loss on derivative instruments in the second quarter of fiscal year we use a variety of strategies to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices including entering into fixed price contracts and entering into hedges which mitigate the variability in cash flows generated from the sales of recycled paper at floating prices  resulting in a fixed price being received from these sales 
as of april   we were not party to any commodity hedging agreements 
for further discussion on commodity price volatility  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price volatility below 
we have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec pursuant to which we may from time to time issue securities in an amount of up to million 
following the stock sale in october  an aggregate of million remains available for issuance under the shelf registration statement 
our ability and willingness to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any such desired offering and therefore we may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in millions and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years fiscal year s ending april  thereafter total long term debt financing lease obligations interest obligations operating leases capping closure post closure total contractual cash obligations interest obligations based on debt  capital lease and financing lease obligation balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt were calculated using variable rates in effect at april  includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year in addition to the above obligations  we have unrecognized tax benefits at april  of approximately million 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at april   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the timing of cash settlements 

table of contents inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we have implemented a fuel surcharge program  which is designed to recover escalating fuel price fluctuations above an expected floor 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases 
our business is located in the northeastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
limitations on ownership of notes pursuant to section of the indenture governing the notes and the provisions of the converted bonds and vermont bonds  no beneficial holder of the notes  converted bonds and or vermont bonds is permitted to knowingly acquire notes  converted bonds and or vermont bonds if such person would own or more of the consolidated debt for which relevant subsidiaries of ours are obligated and must dispose of notes  converted bonds and or vermont bonds or other debt of ours to the extent such person becomes aware of exceeding such threshold  if such ownership would require consent of any regulatory authority under applicable law or regulation governing solid waste operators and such consent has not been obtained 
we will furnish to the holders of the notes  converted bonds and vermont bonds  in each quarterly and annual report  the dollar amount of our debt that would serve as the threshold for evaluating a beneficial holder s compliance with these ownership restrictions 
as of april   that dollar amount was million 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  as applicable  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
landfills the cost estimates for capping  closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
we also estimate additional costs based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each capping event and the timing of construction related to each capping event and of closure and post closure activities 
because landfill capping  closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and results of operations 
landfill development costs we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity 
this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  landfill gas collection systems  environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas  directly related engineering  capitalized interest  on site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs 
additionally  landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property 
the projection of these landfill costs is dependent  in part  on future events 
the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs 

table of contents under life cycle accounting  all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to expense based on tonnage placed into each site 
landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed 
in determining the amortization rate for these landfills  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and expansion capacity 
landfill capping costs capping activities include the installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill 
our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each capping event based on the acreage to be capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill 
landfill closure and post closure closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  lawyers  accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act of  as amended  as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
closure and post closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection  groundwater monitoring  leachate management  methane gas control and recovery  and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
remaining permitted airspace our engineers  in consultation with third party engineering consultants and surveyors  are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills 
the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey  which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 
expansion airspace we currently include unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances 
to be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received  and senior management has approved the project 
for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above 
these criteria are annually evaluated by our engineers  accountants  lawyers  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards  an airspace utilization factor the auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons 
the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculation of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  we include the projected costs for development  as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to capping  closure and post closure of the expansion airspace in the amortization basis of the landfill 

table of contents after determining the costs and the remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills  we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons 
we calculate per ton amortization rates for assets associated with each capping event  for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future for each landfill 
these rates per ton are updated annually  or more often  as significant facts change 
it is possible that actual results  including the amount of costs incurred  the timing of capping  closure and post closure activities  our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent that such estimates  or related assumptions  prove to be significantly different than actual results  lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates  higher capping  closure or post closure rates  or higher expenses  or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs 
most significantly  if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset  we may be required to recognize an asset impairment 
if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote  the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 
environmental remediation liabilities we have recorded environmental liabilities representing our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined that a liability is probable 
these liabilities include potentially responsible party investigations  settlements  certain legal and consultant fees  as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site specific facts and circumstances 
estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
accounts receivable trade  net of allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable trade represent receivables from customers for collection  transfer  recycling  disposal and other services 
our accounts receivable trade are recorded when billed or when related revenue is earned  if earlier  and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash 
the carrying value of our accounts receivable trade  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  represents their estimated net realizable value 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable trade by aging category 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
past due receivables are written off once deemed to be uncollectible 
goodwill and other intangibles we do not amortize goodwill 
we annually assess goodwill impairment at the end of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
we assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments 
our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we will not perform a quantitative assessment 
if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment  we perform a quantitative assessment  or two step impairment test  to determine whether goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments  and our recycling segment  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate  applicable for each reporting unit 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 

table of contents in addition to an annual goodwill impairment assessment  we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold  or the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the segment 
we elected not to perform a qualitative analysis as part of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year we incurred no goodwill impairment in fiscal years  or as a result of our annual fourth quarter goodwill impairment test 
however  there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future

covenants not to compete and customer lists are amortized based on the economic benefit provided or the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  typically no more than years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k for further disclosure 
recovery of long lived assets we continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets other than goodwill or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment 
long lived assets include  for example  capitalized landfill costs  other property and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets 
events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit 
there are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion 
for example  a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted 
in addition  management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace 
therefore  certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry 

table of contents if an impairment indicator occurs  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we group our long lived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value 
to determine fair value  we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset group 
this analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial forecasts developed internally by management 
the discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved 
we may also rely on third party valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets 
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we initiated a plan to dispose of bio fuels  a construction and demolition material processing facility located in lewiston  maine  and as a result  the assets associated with bio fuels were classified as held for sale and the results of operations were recorded as discontinued operations 
assets of the disposal group classified as held for sale include certain inventory and plant and equipment 
we recognized a million loss associated with the adjustment of the disposal group to fair value as discontinued operations 
there are inherent judgments and estimates used in determining impairment charges and the actual sale of a business can result in the recognition of an additional gain or loss 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k for further disclosure 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into negotiations regarding the sale of maine energy 
based on the proposed purchase consideration  we reviewed the asset group for impairment and recorded a million impairment charge to the asset group within the eastern region segment 
the impairment was measured based on the asset group s highest and best use under the market approach  utilizing the discounted present cash flows associated with the purchase consideration of the facility  adjusted for costs to demolish the facility 
we used a discount rate of  which approximates the buyer s borrowing rate 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell the real property of maine energy to the city of biddeford  maine 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we closed and initiated the decommissioning process of the facility 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k for further disclosure 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a recycling processing facility 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are self insured for vehicles and workers compensation 
our maximum exposure in fiscal year under the workers compensation plan is million per individual event  after which reinsurance takes effect 
our maximum exposure under the automobile plan is million per individual event  after which reinsurance takes effect 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined by management with the assistance of a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
we use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated based on historical data  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future events differ significantly from our assumptions 
income tax accruals we use estimates to determine our provision for income taxes and related assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using currently enacted tax rates 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making this determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 

table of contents we account for income tax uncertainties according to guidance on the recognition  de recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k for further disclosure 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and regulatory matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable  and whether it can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities 
management s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
we accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
if a contingent liability is only reasonably possible  we will disclose the potential range of the loss  if estimable 
we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k for further disclosure 
stock based compensation all share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
stock based compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated using a black scholes option pricing model  which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation  including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate volatility we had interest rate risk relating to approximately million of long term debt at april  the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate portion of long term debt was approximately at april  should the average interest rate on the variable rate portion of long term debt change by basis points  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by million 
the remainder of our long term debt is at fixed rates and not subject to interest rate risk 
we are currently party to two forward starting interest rate derivative agreements  which we initially entered into to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted financing transaction to redeem our second lien notes effective january  the total notional amount of these agreements is million and require us to receive interest based on changes in the london interbank offered rate index and pay interest at a rate of approximately 
the agreements mature on march  in the second quarter of fiscal year  we dedesignated both of the million forward starting interest rate derivative agreements and discontinued hedge accounting in accordance with asc because the interest payments associated with that portion of the forecasted financing transaction were no longer deemed probable 
we recognized a million loss  reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss  as loss on derivative instruments in the second quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents commodity price volatility through our recycling operation  we market a variety of materials  including fibers such as old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint  plastics  glass  ferrous and aluminum metals 
we use a number of strategies to mitigate impacts from commodity price fluctuations  such as indexed purchases  floor prices  fixed price agreements  and revenue share arrangements 
as of april   we were not party to any commodity hedge contracts 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
if commodity prices were to have changed by on may   the impact on our operating income in fiscal year is estimated by management to have been between million and million based on the observed impact of commodity price changes on operating income margin during the years ended april  and our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices is complex because each customer contract is unique relative to revenue sharing  tipping or processing fees and other arrangements 
the above estimated ranges of operating income impact may not be indicative of future operating results and actual results may vary materially
