item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition for a discussion of the restructuring charges related to fiscal   and the company s impairment testing is performed on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company recorded a  goodwill impairment charge in accordance with asc topic during the fourth quarter of fiscal refer to item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 
the company had a valuation allowance of  recorded as of march  due to the uncertainty of whether the company net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized 
the company was able to utilize  of us federal net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal which reduced the valuation allowance by  as a result of the increased operating performance of the company over the past several years  the company reevaluated the certainty as to whether the company remaining net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized 
as a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of certain us federal tax credit carryforwards  a significant portion of the remaining valuation allowance totaling  was reversed in fiscal during  the company recorded non cash charge of  included within its provision for income taxes 
as noted in footnote number above  this valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal the majority of this charge relates to the company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the u 
s is necessary 
accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment 
if a cumulative loss threshold is met  the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary

we expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal to be in the range of  to  excluding acquisitions and strategic alliances 

table of contents inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in non us economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  south america and asia pacific 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges 
however  us employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
with changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years  we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases 
we will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included an subordinated note in the principal amount of  payable over years 
due to the uncertainty of its collection  the note was recorded at its estimated net realizable value of at the time of the divestiture 
principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt 
accordingly   and  of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal  and respectively  net of tax 
the note was paid during the year ended march  during the year ended march  the company sold certain assets of the gaffey division of crane equipment and service  inc the sale of the gaffey assets did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements and therefore was not reclassified as a discontinued operation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
if interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances  changes in our estimates could result in material changes to our reported results 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition  but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables 
the credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in note to our fiscal consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
changes in these assumptions can result in the calculation of different plan expense and liability amounts 
further  actual experience can differ from the assumptions 

table of contents the pension discount rate assumptions of   and  as of march    and  respectively  are based on long term aa rated corporate and municipal bond rates 
the decrease in the discount rate for fiscal resulted in a  increase in the projected benefit obligation 
the decrease in the discount rates for fiscal resulted in an  increase in the projected benefit obligation 
the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of for each of the years ended march   and is based on the targeted plan asset allocation approximately equities and fixed income and their long term historical returns 
our under funded status for all pension plans as of march  and was  and  or and of the projected benefit obligation  respectively 
our pension contributions during fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively 
the under funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate  less than the fiscal amount of  pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year is expected to increase by approximately  compared to fiscal the compensation increase assumption of as of march    and is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns 
the healthcare costs inflation assumptions of  and for fiscal   and  respectively  are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
these actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors  including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims  trends or changes in claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations 
changes to these estimates could result in material changes to the amount of expense and liabilities recorded in our financial statements 
further  actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
goodwill impairment testing 
our goodwill balance   as of march  is subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually  as of the end of february  and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment 
these events or circumstances could include a significant long term adverse change in the business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
we test goodwill at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segment 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units for example  similar products and or services  similar long term financial results  product processes  classes of customers  etc we have four reporting units  only two of which have goodwill 
our duff norton reporting unit and rest of products reporting unit have goodwill totaling  and  respectively  at march  when we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment  we assess a range of qualitative factors including  but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and services  regulatory and political developments  entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance 
if  after completing this assessment  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we proceed to a two step impairment test 
in order to perform the two step impairment test  we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units 
the discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions  the most significant being projected revenue growth rates  operating profit margins and cash flows  the terminal growth rate and the discount rate 
management projects revenue growth rates  operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business  expected developments and operational strategies over a five year period 
in estimating the terminal growth rate  we consider our historical and projected results  as well as the economic environment in which our reporting units operate 
the discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect management s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions  both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy 

table of contents we performed our qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value 
accordingly  we did not perform the two step goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units 
accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging 
accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted 
at march  the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment amounts in millions balance as of march  property  plant and equipment  net acquired intangibles with estimable useful lives other assets impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss  if any  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
we also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
in fiscal years  and income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were not reflective of us statutory rates 
the company had a valuation allowance of  at march  due to the uncertainty of whether us federal and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards nols and deferred tax assets might ultimately be realized 
in fiscal year  we utilized the remaining us federal nols thereby  reducing the valuation allowance by  as a result of our increased operating performance over the past several years  we reevaluated the certainty as to whether our remaining nols and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized 
management concluded that it is more likely than not that almost all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized  therefore   of the remaining valuation allowance was reversed as of march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded a non cash charge of  included within its provision for income taxes 
the balance of the valuation allowance at march  was  this charge relates to the company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the us was necessary 
the deferred tax assets relate principally to liabilities related to employee benefit plans  insurance reserves  us tax credits  and us nols 
the us nols have been generated primarily as a result of restructuring costs in fiscal years and accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment 
during the third quarter ended december   the company determined that it would be in a three year cumulative pretax loss position in the us at march  primarily due to restructuring related charges incurred in the us  despite our expectations of future profitability 
if the cumulative loss threshold is met  the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary 

table of contents the internal revenue code imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
if we were to experience an ownership change  utilization of our nols would be subject to an annual limitation determined by multiplying the market value of our outstanding shares of stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years within the allowed nol carryforward period 
the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five year period after the change

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  china  germany  united kingdom  hungary  mexico and france and sell our products in approximately countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies  the mexican peso and the chinese yuan 
for example  when the us dollar weakens against the euro  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in euros increases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
for example  a change in the value of the us dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately  on our net income 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
the company has foreign currency forward agreements and cross currency swaps in place to offset changes in the value of intercompany loans to certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the notional amount of these derivatives is  and all contracts mature by september  these contracts are not designated as hedges 
the company has foreign currency forward agreements in place to hedge changes in the value of recorded foreign currency liabilities due to changes in foreign exchange rates at the settlement date 
the notional amount of those derivatives is  and all contracts mature within twelve months 
these contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges 
the company has foreign currency forward agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases and sales  including multi year contracts related to capital project sales  denominated in a foreign currency 
the notional amount of those derivatives is  and all contracts mature within fifteen months of march  we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate 
at march   we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
at march  and  approximately and of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates  respectively 
at those dates  we had approximately and  respectively  of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by in fiscal and less than  in fiscal
