western region operations segment our western region operations segment includes the operations of our commercial  medicare and medicaid health plans as well as the operations of our health and life insurance companies primarily in arizona  california  oregon and washington  and certain operations of our behavioral health and pharmaceutical services subsidiaries in several states  including arizona  california and oregon 
as of december   we had approximately million risk members in our western region operations segment 
managed health care operations we offer a full spectrum of managed health care products and services 
our strategy is to create affordable and tailored customer solutions by i seeking to provide product offerings that both anticipate and respond to current and emerging market demands  ii pursuing innovative provider relationships that effectively manage the cost of care  and iii building alliances with other stakeholders in the health care system to identify and implement changes to help improve the quality and accessibility of the health care system 
the pricing of our products is designed to reflect the varying costs of health care based on the benefit alternatives in our products 
our health plans offer members coverage for a wide range of health care services including ambulatory and outpatient physician care  hospital care  pharmacy services  behavioral health and ancillary diagnostic and therapeutic services 
our health plans include a matrix package  which allows employers and members to select their desired coverage from a variety of alternatives 
our principal commercial health care products are as follows hmo plans our health maintenance organization or hmo plans offer comprehensive benefits generally for a fixed fee or premium that does not vary with the extent or frequency of medical services actually received by the member 
we offer hmo plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of co payments at different premium rates 
these plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians  hospitals and other providers 
when an individual enrolls in one of our hmo plans  he or she selects a primary care physician pcp from among the physicians participating in our network 
pcps generally are family practitioners  general practitioners or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care  and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services  including making referrals to participating network specialists 
in california  participating providers are typically contracted through medical groups and independent physician associations 
in those cases  enrollees in hmo plans are generally required to secure specialty professional services from physicians in the group  as long as such services are available from group physicians 
a significant majority of our california membership is in hmo plans 
ppo plans our preferred provider organization or ppo plans offer coverage for services received from any health care provider  with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and co payments or coinsurance 
pos plans our point of service or pos plans blend the characteristics of hmo  ppo and indemnity plans 
members can have comprehensive hmo style benefits for services received from participating network providers with lower co payments particularly within the medical group  but also have coverage  generally at higher co payment or coinsurance levels  for services received outside the network 
in the past several years  the adoption of the aca as defined below and continuing weak economic conditions in the united states and  in particular  california  have driven a renewed interest in the managed care model 
the evolving health care landscape  including the changes presented by the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the aca and related state initiatives and regulations  have  among other things  resulted in the emergence of new health care delivery systems with a focus on coordination of care and cost management 
see government regulation health care reform legislation for additional information on health care reform and the aca 
in addition  the weak economy has caused customers both individuals and employer groups to make health insurance purchasing decisions based on value versus choice 
we believe that customers are increasingly choosing health plans that offer the best financial value over health plans that offer a broader network at a higher premium 
we have developed and are selling products using tailored networks to meet this need 
these tailored network products use provider networks that share our commitment to quality health care combined with affordability for our members 
these products also incorporate benefit levels that help ensure our members have access to the care they need 
we offer tailored network hmo products throughout our western region operations 
these networks can be structured in a variety of ways  including a tiered provider option based on cost and quality  products tailored to targeted populations and networks organized in conjunction with a strategic provider partner 
for example  our hmo silver network is a network of hmo doctors  specialists and hospitals in ten counties in california 
our salud con health net sm product line is a suite of affordable plans targeting the latino community 
it is our fastest growing tailored network product in our western region operations 
we have developed tailored network products with strategic provider partners in california  arizona  oregon and washington 
we have also developed customized products for key employer groups with a large geographic distribution within a particular state 
we assume both underwriting and administrative expense risk in return for the premium revenue we receive from our hmo  pos and ppo products 
we have contractual relationships with health care providers for the delivery of health care to our enrollees in these products 
in california  we generally utilize a capitation fee model 
under a capitation fee model  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis  usually monthly  and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
by incentivizing providers to focus on cost management  members are more likely to receive only those services that they actually need rather than extraneous services that drive up costs without any meaningful corresponding health benefit 
see provider relationships for additional information about our capitation fee arrangements and see item a 
risk factors if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships on competitive terms with the hospitals  provider groups and other providers that provide services to our members  our profitability could be adversely affected for additional information on the challenges we face with providers in the changing health care environment

our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with the centers for medicare medicaid services cms under the medicare advantage program authorized under title xviii of the social security act of  as amended most recently by the aca

at the closing of the sale  cvs caremark paid to us million pdp purchase price in cash  representing multiplied by  the number of individuals enrolled as members of a medicare pdp of hnl as of the closing date 
the pdp purchase price was subject to adjustment based on pretax cash flow  net asset valuation and prepaid expenses the financial adjustment and enrollee numbers related to our medicare pdp business  each as set forth in the asset purchase agreement

medicare advantage products as of december   we were one of the nation largest medicare advantage contractors based on membership of  members 
we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide medicare advantage products directly to medicare beneficiaries and through employer and union groups 
we provide or arrange health care benefits for services normally covered by medicare  plus a broad range of health care benefits for services not covered by traditional medicare  usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from cms that varies based on the geographic area in which the member resides  demographic factors of the member such as age  gender and institutionalized status  and the health status of the member 
any additional benefits in our plans are covered by a monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from cms that may be allocated to these benefits  according to cms regulations and guidance 
our portfolio of medicare advantage plans focuses on simplicity so that members can use benefits with minimal paperwork and receive coverage that starts immediately upon enrollment 
we also provide medicare supplemental coverage to  members as of december  through either individual medicare supplement policies or employer group sponsored coverage 
we provide medicare advantage plans in select counties in arizona  california  oregon and washington

these plans provide access to additional health care and prescription drug coverage 
cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans  awarding between one and five stars to medicare advantage plans based on certain measures of quality 
the star ratings are used by cms to award quality based payments to medicare advantage plans 
beginning with the star rating calculated in the fall of  medicare advantage plans that achieve a minimum of stars will receive a quality based payment in quality based payments related to the   and benefit years have been based on a quality based payment demonstration 
the methodology and measures used in the star ratings system are changed annually and star ratings thresholds are based on performance of medicare advantage plans nationally 
medicaid and related products we are one of the ten largest medicaid hmos in the united states based on membership 
as of december   we had  members enrolled in medi cal california medicaid program and other california state health programs 
to enroll in our medi cal products  an individual must be eligible for medicaid benefits in accordance with california regulatory requirements 
the state of california department of health care services dhcs pays us a monthly fee for the coverage of our medicaid members 
the monthly fee is based on prepaid payment rates that are required by federal law to be actuarially sound  and ultimately determined by the state 
the state considers a combination of various factors in setting these rates  including  without limitation  geographic area  defined upper payment limits  a members health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix and member eligibility category

california coordinated care initiative in  the california legislature enacted the coordinated care initiative  or cci 
the stated purpose of the cci is to provide a more efficient health care delivery system and improved coordination of care to individuals that are fully eligible for medicare and medi cal benefits  or dual eligibles  as well as to all medi cal only beneficiaries who rely on long term services and supports  or ltss  which includes institutional long term care and home and community based services and other support services 
accordingly  in participating counties  the cci will establish a voluntary three year duals demonstration program to coordinate medical  behavioral health  long term institutional  and home and community based services for dual eligibles through a single health plan  and will require that all medi cal beneficiaries in participating counties join a medi cal managed care health plan to receive their medi cal benefits  including ltss 
the dhcs has selected eight counties to participate in the cci los angeles  san diego  orange  san bernardino  riverside  alameda  san mateo and santa clara 
health plans selected to participate in the cci in a given county will be required to provide a full range of benefits for medical services  including primary care and specialty physician  hospital and ancillary services  as well as behavioral and ltss 
on april   dhcs selected us to participate in the cci for both los angeles county and san diego county 
we currently do not provide all of the benefits required for participation in the cci  including  among others  custodial care in nursing homes and in home support services 
we will need to make arrangements to provide such benefits either directly or by subcontracting with other parties prior to the commencement of the cci 
dual eligibles are expected to receive advance notice regarding their enrollment options  which varies by county 
as currently proposed  the duals demonstration would continue for a three year term ending december  and beginning no sooner than september  with initial enrollment occurring on a phased in basis based on birth date 
the dhcs has selected health net and the local initiative plan  la care health plan la care  for the cci in los angeles county 
la care is a public agency that serves low income persons in los angeles county through health coverage programs such as medi cal 
dual eligibles in los angeles county will be able to choose between an opt out option or choose either la care or us for benefits under the duals demonstration 
dual eligibles who opt out will continue to receive medi cal benefits through a managed care health plan under the cci  but will receive separate fee for service medicare benefits 
if no selection is made  the dual eligibles would be passively enrolled and allocated to either la care or us 
the methodology for this allocation process has yet to be determined 
the initial enrollment period in los angeles county will be phased in over months 
the dhcs has selected us and three other health plans for the cci in san diego county 
dual eligibles in san diego county will be able to select to receive benefits from any one of these health plans  or elect an opt out option similar to the option in los angeles county 
if no selection is made  the dual eligibles will be passively enrolled and allocated to one of the health plans 
the methodology for this allocation process has yet to be determined 
the initial enrollment period in san diego county will be phased in over months 
participation in the duals demonstration would require us to enter into a three way agreement with the dhcs and cms  under which  among other things  we would receive prospective blended capitated payments in an amount to be determined to provide coverage for dual eligibles 
the cci is subject to the approval of cms 
prior to cms determination on whether to approve the cci  various stakeholders have been given the opportunity to comment on the program  which may impact cms decision 
in addition  we will likely be required to make certain filings with  and obtain approvals from  the state of california department of managed health care the dmhc on an ongoing basis in connection with our participation in the cci 
for example  on october   the dmhc approved certain modifications to the internal organizational structure of our subsidiaries related to our participation in the cci

ppg and physician contracts are generally for a period of at least one year and are automatically renewable unless terminated  with certain requirements for maintenance of good professional standing and compliance with our quality  utilization and administrative procedures 
in california  ppgs generally receive a monthly capitation fee for every member assigned to it 
the capitation fee represents payment in full for all medical and ancillary services specified in the provider agreements 
for these capitation fee arrangements  in cases where the capitated ppg cannot provide the health care services needed  such ppgs generally contract with specialists and other ancillary service providers to furnish the requisite services under capitation agreements or negotiated fee schedules with specialists 
outside of california  most of our hmos reimburse physicians according to a discounted fee for service schedule  although several have capitation arrangements with certain providers and provider groups in their market areas 
a provider group financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in our ppo plans  members are not required to select a primary care physician and generally do not require prior authorization for specialty care 
for services provided under our ppo products and the out of network benefits of our pos products  we ordinarily reimburse physicians pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements 
hnfs maintains a network of qualified physicians  facilities  and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our t contract for the tricare north region 
services are provided on a fee for service basis 
as of december   hnfs had  physicians   facilities and  ancillary providers in its tricare network 
our behavioral health subsidiary  mhn  maintains a provider network comprised of approximately  psychiatrists  psychologists and other clinical categories of providers nationwide 
substantially all of these providers are contracted with mhn on an individual or small practice group basis and are paid on a discounted fee for service basis 
members who wish to access certain behavioral health services contact mhn and are referred to contracted providers for evaluation or treatment services 
if a member needs inpatient services  mhn maintains a network of approximately  facilities 
in addition to the physicians that are in our networks  we have also entered into agreements with various third parties that have networks of physicians contracted to them third party networks 
in general  under a third party network arrangement  health net is licensed by the third party to access its network providers and pay the claims of these physicians pursuant to the pricing terms of their contracts with the third party network 
hospital relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for hospital care primarily through contracts with selected hospitals in their service areas 
these hospital contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
covered hospital based care for our members is comprehensive 
it includes the services of hospital based physicians  nurses and other hospital personnel  room and board  intensive care  laboratory and x ray services  diagnostic imaging and generally all other services normally provided by acute care hospitals 
our nurses and medical directors are involved in a wide variety of medical management activities on behalf of our hmo and  to a somewhat lesser extent  ppo members 
these activities can include discharge planning and case management  which often involves the coordination of community support services  including visiting nurses  physical therapy  durable medical equipment and home intravenous therapy 
ancillary and other provider relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for ancillary and other provider services  such as ambulance  laboratory  radiology  home health  chiropractic and acupuncture primarily through contracts with selected providers in their service areas 
these contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
in certain cases  these provider services are included in contracts our health plan subsidiaries have with ppgs and hospitals

risk factors if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships on competitive terms with the hospitals  provider groups and other providers that provide services to our members  our profitability could be adversely affected for additional information on the risks associated with our provider relationships 
additional information concerning our business competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  market pressures  and regulatory and legislative reform including but not limited to the federal health care reform legislation described below in government regulation 
our competitors include managed health care companies  insurance companies  hmos  third party administrators  self funded groups and provider owned plans 
our health plans face substantial competition from both for profit and nonprofit health plans that offer hmo  ppo  self funded and traditional indemnity insurance products including self insured employers and union trust funds 
we also face substantial competition from both for profit and nonprofit health plans  as well as other non health plan companies with respect to our contracts with the federal government  including our t and mflc contracts  which are subject to periodic re competition 
some of our competitors have substantially larger enrollments and greater financial resources than we do 
we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered  size and quality of provider network  quality of service  responsiveness to customer demands  financial stability  comprehensiveness of coverage  diversity of product offerings  market presence and reputation 
the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market and product 
we believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants 
our primary competitors in california are kaiser permanente  anthem blue cross of california  blue shield of california and unitedhealth group  inc together  these four plans and health net account for a majority of the insured market in california 
based on the number of enrollees  kaiser is the largest managed health care company in california and anthem blue cross of california is the largest ppo provider in california 
there are also a number of small  regional health plans that compete with health net in california  mainly in the small business group market segment 
in addition  two of the major national managed care companies  aetna  inc and cigna corp  are active in california 
while cigna commercial full risk market share is not as significant as that of our primary competitors in california  we believe that it remains in california primarily to serve its national  self funded accounts with employees in california 
cigna is one of our primary competitors in the large group market and aetna is a competitor in both the small and large group markets 
in arizona  our primary competitors are blue cross blue shield of arizona and unitedhealth group  inc we also compete with aetna  inc  cigna corp  assurant health and humana inc our oregon health plan competes primarily with providence health services  regence blue cross blue shield of oregon  kaiser permanente  pacificsource health plans  ods health plans  inc  lifewise health plan of oregon and unitedhealth group  inc with respect to our t contract for the tricare north region and mflc contracts  our primary competitors in the bidding process include humana  united healthgroup  inc  aetna  inc  magellan health services  valueoptions  inc and triwest healthcare alliance  among others 
if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

risk factors the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
marketing and sales we market our products and services to individuals and employer groups through internal sales staff  independent brokers  agents and consultants and through the internet 
for our group health business  we market our products and services utilizing a three step process 
we first market to potential employer groups  group insurance brokers and consultants 
we then provide information directly to employees once the employer has selected our health coverage 
finally  we engage members and employers in marketing for member and group retention 
for our small group business  members are enrolled in the plan chosen by the employer 
in general  once selected by a large employer group  we solicit enrollees from the employee base directly 
during open enrollment periods when employees are permitted to change health care programs  we use a variety of techniques to attract new enrollees and retain existing members  which at times include  without limitation  direct mail  work day and health fair presentations and telemarketing 
similar methods are used by our medicare business to market to eligible individuals 
our sales efforts are supported by our marketing division  which engages in product research and development  multicultural marketing  advertising and communications  and member education and retention programs 
in  several states in which we operate  including california  will begin to implement the health insurance exchanges created by the aca 
for additional detail on these exchanges and the other requirements of the aca  as well as certain associated risks  see government regulation health care reform legislation and item a 
risk factors federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
the establishment of the exchanges under the aca will create a new competitive insurance marketplace for individuals and small businesses  and will open new distribution channels to these potential customers 
as state and federal agencies promulgate final rules and regulations for the exchanges and reduce the uncertainty surrounding their ultimate operation  we intend to refine and enhance our exchange related marketing strategies 
premiums for each employer group are generally contracted on a yearly basis and are payable monthly 
we consider numerous factors in setting our monthly premiums  including employer group needs and anticipated health care utilization rates as forecast by us based on the demographic composition of  and our prior experience in  our service areas 
premiums are also affected by applicable state and federal law and regulations that may directly or indirectly affect premium setting 
for example  california law limits experience rating of small group accounts taking the group past health care utilization and costs into consideration and requires detailed rate filings for individual and family plans and small employer plans 
see item a 
risk factors we face competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices 
if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover our health care costs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for additional information on regulations and legislation impacting our premium setting 
mandated benefits requiring the coverage of certain benefits as a matter of law  whether desired by the group or not also affect premiums 
for example  in california and elsewhere  mental health parity laws have generally broadened mental health benefits under health insurance policies offered by us and other carriers 
in addition  health plans offering policies on the aca exchanges will be required to offer essential health benefits as defined under the legislation 
in some of our markets we sell individual policies  which are generally sold through independent brokers and agents 
for policies that become effective on or after january   the aca will eliminate medical underwriting for medical insurance coverage decisions  including with respect to preexisting conditions known as guaranteed issue 
for additional detail on these and other requirements of the aca  as well as certain associated risks  see government regulation health care reform legislation and item a 
risk factors federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
prior to the implementation of these aca requirements  in some states including california and for certain products  carriers currently are allowed to individually underwrite individual policies ie select applicants to whom coverage will be provided and others who are denied  except with respect to persons under age in other states  there may be a requirement of guaranteed issue with respect to certain lines of business that restricts the carrier discretion to provide coverage 
in guaranteed issue states  exclusions for preexisting conditions are generally permitted 
in california  current law and regulations allow carriers to individually underwrite policies sold to individuals and families except as noted above as well as large groups  but small group policies may not be underwritten 
the completion of customary underwriting procedures may be a prerequisite to the carrier exercise of any cancellation or rescission right with respect to an issued policy  and the public interest in this practice has caused and may continue to cause additional legislation  regulation and the development of case law which may further restrict carriers in this regard 
as we begin to implement the provisions of the aca  including  among others  the guaranteed issue requirement  we will need to modify our underwriting criteria and procedures in accordance with the requirements of the legislation 
information technology our business depends significantly on effective and efficient information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information management systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have many different information systems that support our various lines of business and we develop new systems as needed to keep pace with continuing changes in technology and to support our operational needs  including potential business expansions 
these systems require the ongoing commitment of significant resources for continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs  evolving industry and regulatory standards  compliance with legal requirements such as icd as defined below and changing customer preferences 
we have partnered with third parties to support our information technology systems and to help design  build  test  implement and maintain our information management systems  and we are considering expanding our outsourced information technology arrangements 
our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity also requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems within our overall enterprise architecture 
in  we continued our multi year effort to consolidate systems across the enterprise  improve enterprise data analytics  strengthen our information security posture and consolidate service centers and associated staff 
in addition  we focused on implementing regulatory and legal compliance requirements in and will continue these efforts in the department of health and human services mandated standards in the electronic transmission of health care transactions  including claims  remittance  eligibility  claims status requests and related responses  and privacy and security standards  known as hipaa compliance with the hipaa electronic data transaction standards was required in we have implemented the hipaa requirements to be able to exchange formats with our trading partners 
furthermore  cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnoses  commonly referred to as icd  which significantly expands the number of codes utilized in claims processing 
the new icd coding set is currently required to be implemented by october  we will be required to incur significant additional expenses to implement and support the new icd coding set 
in addition  our implementation and support of the requirements of the aca will require the expenditure of significant resources

risk factors if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
medical management we believe that managing health care costs is an essential function for a managed care company 
among the medical management techniques we utilize to contain the growth of health care costs are pre authorization or certification for outpatient and inpatient hospitalizations and a concurrent review of active inpatient hospital stays and discharge planning 
we believe that this authorization process reduces inappropriate use of medical resources and achieves efficiencies in referring cases to the most appropriate providers 
we provide care management and case management to our members and also contract with third parties to manage certain conditions such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions and stays  as well as chronic conditions such as asthma  diabetes and congestive heart failure 
these techniques are widely used in the managed care industry and are accepted practices in the medical profession 
accreditation we pursue accreditation for certain of our health plans from the national committee for quality assurance ncqa and the utilization review accreditation commission urac 
ncqa and urac are independent  non profit organizations that review and accredit hmos and other health care organizations 
hmos that apply for accreditation of particular product lines receive accreditation if they comply with review requirements and quality standards 
the medicare line of business of our california hmo has received ncqa accreditation with a score of excellent  which is the highest score ncqa awards 
hn california commercial hmo pos  hnl ppo and our arizona hmo commercial lines of business received ncqa accreditation with a score of commendable

government regulation our business is subject to comprehensive federal regulation and state regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
these laws and regulations govern how we conduct our businesses and result in additional requirements  restrictions and costs to us 
certain of these laws and regulations are discussed below 
new laws and regulations  or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations  including as a result of changes in the political climate  could have an adverse effect on us 
in the event we fail to comply with  or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in  applicable law and regulations  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
for additional information  see item a 
risk factors our businesses are subject to laws and significant rules and regulations  which increases our cost of doing business and could impact our financial performance by restricting our ability to conduct business or adversely affecting our ability to grow our businesses and item a 
risk factors federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows 
health care reform legislation during the first quarter of  president obama signed into law both the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the aca  which is causing and will continue to cause significant changes to the us health care system and alter the dynamics of the health care insurance industry 
the legislation includes provisions  which  among other things will impose a significant non deductible tax technically taking the form of a fee on health insurers  effective for calendar years beginning after december  this health insurer fee will be assessed at a total of billion in  will increase thereafter and will be allocated pro rata amongst industry participants based on net premiums written  subject to certain exceptions 
payment of the health insurer fee will not be due until  however  it has started to impact us since our premium rates are set a year in advance  and the tax amounts for depend on net premiums written in additionally  regulations relating to the health insurer fee have not yet been issued by the internal revenue service irs  making related payment procedures  timing and financial reporting requirements unclear 
if we are not able to incorporate the costs of our pro rata portion of the health insurer fee when we set our premium rates  or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business to address this additional new cost  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  some of our competitors may have greater economies of scale  which  among other things  may lead to lower expense ratios and higher profit margins than we have 
since the health insurer fee is not tax deductible  it will generally represent a higher percentage of our profits  and therefore could impact us to a greater degree than these larger competitors 
moreover  some of our competitors  including  among others  government entities  certain non profits insurers and self funded plans  may not be required to pay the health insurer fee or may be required to pay only one half the rate we will be required to pay  which may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete effectively 
we may not be able to match our competitors ability to support reduced premiums by virtue of any full or partial exemptions from the fees and taxes imposed by the aca  or by making changes to their distribution arrangements  decreasing spending on non medical product features and services  or otherwise adjusting their operating costs and reducing general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the aca requires the establishment of state based or federally facilitated exchanges where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage 
california  oregon and washington  among others  have passed legislation that will make coverage by health plans on their respective exchanges effective in participation in these and other exchanges in the states in which we operate may be conditioned on the approval of the applicable state or federal government regulator 
in some cases  the factors to be considered for inclusion on the exchanges have not yet been finalized or may be subject to change  which could result in the exclusion of some carriers from the exchanges 
in addition  states and the federal government are continuing to finalize other rules and regulations related to the actual operation of the exchanges  including  without limitation  with respect to state and federal rate review for plans offered on the exchanges  federal subsidies for premiums  cost sharing reductions  mandated state essential health benefits  the operation of reinsurance  risk corridors and risk adjustment mechanisms and the ability of participating insurers to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small group employers outside the exchanges 
we have submitted bids to participate in certain exchanges  and intend to submit future bids in certain eligible counties  but due in part to the uncertainty and complexity of the regulatory environment surrounding the implementation of the exchanges  including  among other things  with respect to the required level of essential health benefits that must be provided by participants in the exchanges  there is no assurance that our bids or any participation in exchanges will be successful 
the developing regulatory structure for the exchanges will shape the marketplace for individual and small group health plans both within and outside the exchanges  and these changes will require us to modify our strategies and operations in response 
for example  we will need to adjust our product offerings and marketing and sales practices  including through the development of new tools  to adapt to the new direct to consumer distribution channels that will be introduced in the exchanges 
in response to these changes in the health care market  our competitors could modify their product features or benefits  change their pricing relative to others in the market and adjust their mix of business within or outside the exchanges  or even exit segments of the market 
new competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may also introduce product offerings or pricing that we may not be able to match  which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
see item a 
risk factors the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline for additional discussion on the risks related to the changing competitive landscape 
if we fail to effectively adapt our business strategy and operations to these evolving markets  including with respect to shifts in consumer interface  product offerings and the competitive landscape  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the aca also contains risk adjustment provisions applicable to the individual and small group markets that take effect in these risk adjustment provisions will effectively transfer funds from health plans with relatively lower risk enrollees to plans with relatively higher risk enrollees to help protect against adverse selection 
the individual and small group markets represent a significant portion of our commercial business and the relevant amounts transferred may be substantial 
effectively adapting to these risk adjustment provisions may require us to modify our operational and strategic initiatives to focus on and manage different populations of potential members than we have in the past 
in addition  the risk adjustment mechanism relies on encounter data to define a health plan average actuarial risk 
the process of collecting this data presents disadvantages to more heavily capitated health plans such as ours because providers receiving fixed fees from health insurers do not have the same incentive to provide accurate and complete encounter data with respect to services rendered when compared to providers under fee for service arrangements 
this incentive problem is particularly acute for health plans operating under the delegated hmo model  which is prevalent in our california health plans 
under this model  third party intermediaries assume responsibility for certain utilization management and care coordination responsibilities  including the collection of encounter data 
if we are not able to successfully design and implement operational and strategic initiatives to adapt to these changes in certain of our markets  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
other provisions of the aca include  among other things provide funds to expand medicaid eligibility to all individuals with incomes up to percent of the federal poverty level  commonly referred to as medicaid expansion as discussed below  this provision was made optional for states under the supreme court ruling on the aca  imposing an excise tax on high premium insurance policies  requiring premium rate reviews in certain market segments  stipulating a minimum medical loss ratio as adopted by the secretary of the us department of health and human services hhs  limiting medicare advantage payment rates  increasing mandated essential health benefits in some market segments  specifying certain actuarial value and cost sharing requirements  eliminating medical underwriting for medical insurance coverage decisions  or guaranteed issue  increasing restrictions on rescinding coverage  prohibiting some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members  limiting the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk  limiting the tax deductible amount of compensation paid to health insurance executives  requiring that most individuals obtain health care coverage or pay a penalty  commonly referred to as the individual mandate  imposing a sales tax on medical device manufacturers  increasing fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers  creating a transitional risk corridor program to help protect against rate setting uncertainty in the initial years of the exchanges  and requiring contributions for a transitional reinsurance program 
implementation of the provisions of the aca generally varies from as early as enactment to as late as in addition to the health insurer fee  the establishment of the exchanges and the risk adjustment provisions described above  some other potentially significant provisions of the aca will not become effective until or later  including  but not limited to  the excise tax on high premium insurance policies  increased taxes on medical device manufacturers  increased fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers  the guaranteed issue requirement and the individual mandate 
however  some of these provisions will have an earlier impact on our operations  including in connection with the setting of our premium rates as discussed above 
various aspects of the aca will transform the operating and regulatory landscape in the markets in which we operate  and could have an adverse impact on the cost of operating our business  and our revenues  enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments 
for example  among other things  the aca will require premium rate review in certain market segments and will require that premium rebates be paid to policyholders in the event certain specified minimum medical loss ratios are not met 
we do not believe that we will be required to pay a material amount in rebates with respect to our business  however  we cannot be certain that we will not be required to pay material amounts in rebates in the future 
in addition  as part of the rate review process  certain insurers may be excluded from participating in the exchanges if the review determines that the insurer has demonstrated a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium rate increases 
the aca may also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain members  and will increase the amount of certain taxes and fees we pay  the latter of which is expected to increase our effective tax rate in future periods 
as noted above with respect to the health insurer fee  we are unable to estimate the amount of these fees and taxes or the increase in our effective tax rate because material information and guidance regarding the calculations of these fees and taxes has not been issued 
the sales tax on medical device manufacturers and increase in the amount of fees pharmaceutical manufacturers pay imposed by the aca  could  in turn  also increase our medical costs 
further  it is not yet clear how state regulators will respond to rate filings that include requests to increase premiums to cover increased costs resulting from the health insurer fee or any other portion of the aca  particularly in light of recent heightened regulatory scrutiny of premium rates 
in the event regulators take positions preventing or delaying health insurers from increasing premiums to reflect aca related costs  or if consumers forego coverage as a result of such premium increases  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
see item a 
risk factors we face competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices 
if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover our costs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for further information on how these increased costs and our related ability to increase premium prices could affect our profitability 
we also face additional competition as new competitors enter the marketplace and existing competitors seize on opportunities to expand their business as a result of the aca  including as discussed above with respect to the exchanges 
for example  among other things  aca provisions related to accountable care organizations  or acos  which are intended to create incentives for health care participants to work together to treat an individual across different care settings  may create opportunities for provider organizations to compete with us by assuming care management and other administrative responsibilities as part of a more integrated delivery system 
however  there remains considerable uncertainty about the impact of the aca on the health insurance market as a whole and what actions our competitors or potential competitors could take in response to the legislation 
for additional information  see item a 
risk factors the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
there are numerous steps required to implement the aca  and clarifying regulations and other guidance are expected over several years 
additional guidance and regulations on certain provisions of the aca have been issued  including proposed rules  but we are still awaiting further final guidance or regulations on a number of key provisions 
these provisions include certain aspects of the calculation of the health insurer fee as noted above  the risk adjustment  risk corridor and reinsurance programs  the limitation on deductibility of executive compensation and market reforms such as guaranteed availability  ratings reform and essential health benefits  among others 
the final regulations relating to the medicare shared savings program reflecting the use of acos have been issued  but as noted above  the impact of these new regulations on the health care market and the role to be played by health plans in the operation of acos remains to be determined 
moreover  though the federal government has in certain instances issued final regulations  including  for example  with respect to the exchanges  there remains considerable uncertainty around the ultimate requirements of the legislation  as the final regulations are sometimes unclear or incomplete  and are subject to further change 
as a result  many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for certain until the ultimate requirements of the aca have been definitively determined 
because of the magnitude  scope and complexity of the aca  we also need to dedicate substantial resources and incur material expenses to implement the legislation 
any delay or failure by us to execute our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to health care reform or otherwise appropriately react to the legislation  implementing regulations and actions of our competitors could result in operational disruptions  disputes with our providers or members  increased exposure to litigation  regulatory issues  damage to our existing or potential member relationships or other adverse consequences 
in addition  certain legal and legislative challenges to the aca remain despite the us supreme court june decision in nfib v 
sebelius and the november presidential and congressional elections 
in sebelius  the supreme court upheld the aca individual mandate as valid under congress taxing power 
the sebelius decision also permits states to opt out of the elements of the aca that require expansion of medicaid coverage in january without losing their existing federal medicaid funding 
although many states  such as california  may continue to consider extending coverage to the uninsured through medicaid expansions  the supreme court decision to overturn the part of the aca that conditions ongoing funding for medicaid on participation by states in the medicaid expansion may cause some states  such as arizona  to choose not to expand medicaid coverage as required in the initial legislation 
further  there is uncertainty as to how the supreme court decision will be interpreted at the federal and state levels  which has created greater uncertainty with regard to which states will choose to accept the medicaid expansion and the future size and scope of state medicaid programs 
medicaid expansion in california has not been formally addressed  but is generally expected to be approved in connection with the state budget process in notwithstanding sebelius  other legal challenges to the aca have been threatened or are still pending at lower court levels  which could result in portions of the aca being struck down 
these threatened and pending challenges include disputing the irs official position that premium tax credits are available to low income individuals who purchase insurance through federally facilitated exchanges 
a successful challenge in this area could significantly affect the affordability of insurance to low income individuals in states that do not administer their own exchanges  such as arizona 
finally  though legislative repeal of the aca is unlikely following the presidential and congressional elections  congress has proposed certain legislative initiatives that may affect certain provisions of the aca  such as with respect to certain subsidies available to low income individuals  and may attempt to amend or withhold the funding necessary to implement the aca 
any such amendment or withholding of aca funding  extended delays in the issuance of clarifying regulations and other guidance or other lingering uncertainty regarding the aca could cause us to incur additional costs of compliance or require us to significantly modify or adjust certain of the operational and strategic initiatives we have already established 
such modifications may result in the loss of some or all of the substantial resources that have been and will be invested in the aca implementation  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock 
various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level 
many of the states in which we operate are already implementing parts of the aca and many states have added new requirements that are more exacting than the aca requirements 
states may also mandate minimum medical loss ratios  implement rate reforms and enact benefit mandates that go beyond provisions included in the aca 
for example  while recently proposed california legislation requiring prior approval of premium rates by the california department of insurance the cdoi did not pass  an initiative measure in california to require prior approval for individual and small group rates by the cdoi has qualified for the ballot 
in addition  oversight boards associated with the state based exchanges in california  oregon and washington will negotiate the price of coverage sold on these exchanges 
these kinds of state regulations and legislation could limit or delay our ability to increase premiums even where actuarially supported and thereby could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
this also could increase the competition we face from companies that have lower health care or administrative costs than we do and therefore can price their premiums at lower levels than we can

risk factors the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
further  the interaction of new federal regulations and the implementation efforts of the various states in which we do business will continue to create substantial uncertainty for us and other health insurance companies about the requirements under which we must operate 
even in cases where state action is limited to implementing federal reforms  new or amended state laws will be required in many cases  and we will be required to operate under and comply with the various laws of each of the states in which we operate 
states may disagree in their interpretations of the federal statute and regulations  and state guidance that is issued could be unclear or untimely 
in the case of the aca exchanges  we will be required to operate under and comply with the regulatory authority of the federal government in addition to the regimes of each of the states that establish and administer their own exchanges 
for example  while california  oregon and washington have passed legislation establishing their own state run exchanges  arizona has declared that it will not create a state run exchange and instead will rely on a federally facilitated exchange 
if we do not successfully implement the various state law requirements of the aca  including with respect to the exchanges  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
due to the unsettled nature of the aca  its complexity  and the numerous steps required to implement it  we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of future regulations and laws  including state laws  implementing the aca 
depending in part on its ultimate requirements  the aca could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other federal laws and regulation medicare legislation and regulation

in addition  our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms

federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs  particularly in light of california recent history of state budget deficits 
federal law permits the federal government to oversee and  in some cases  to enact  regulations and other requirements that must be followed by california with respect to these programs 
medicaid and chip are administered at the federal level by cms 
in october  cms approved certain elements of california budget proposals to reduce medi cal provider reimbursement rates as authorized by california assembly bill ab 
the elements approved by cms include a percent reduction in a number of provider reimbursement rates 
following a series of legal challenges to ab that enjoined its implementation  the cuts have again been reflected in the california budget proposal announced in january while the implementation of ab remains subject to appeal in the ninth us circuit court of appeals  and the budget proposal is subject to change prior to its approval by the california legislature  if the cuts are implemented as currently proposed  they would be applied as of april  if such rate cuts are implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and or received from the government  it could adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
this risk may be amplified as our medi cal membership may increase through  among other things  the expected medicaid expansion in california 
however  the impact of such cuts could be limited since they would need to be reconciled with minimum payment rates for primary care physicians dictated by the aca for and therefore  due to the uncertainty regarding the final implementation of ab  we cannot reasonably estimate whether there will be reductions in premiums and or related health care cost recoveries nor can we estimate the range of any such reductions that may result in connection with ab see item a 
risk factors a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
privacy regulations 
the use  disclosure and maintenance of individually identifiable health information and other data by our businesses is regulated by various laws at the federal  state and local level 
these laws and regulations are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
most of those laws are derived from health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the gramm leach bliley act  although there are an increasing number of state laws that require notification to individuals and regulatory authorities in the event of a security breach and that specifically regulate the use and disclosure of social security numbers 
hipaa and the implementing regulations that have been adopted in connection with it impose obligations for group health plans and issuers of health insurance coverage such as health insurers and health maintenance organizations relating to the privacy and security of protected health information including electronically transmitted protected health information collectively  phi 
the regulations  which relate to the privacy and security of phi  require health plans  health care clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to protect phi  create policies related to the privacy of phi  enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed  and notify individuals and regulatory authorities if phi is compromised 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
recent developments in this area include the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act  which was initially passed in and implemented on a rolling basis through subsequent rulemaking  the latest series of which was issued on january  by the office of civil rights ocr of hhs 
the hitech act expands the hipaa rules for security and privacy safeguards  including enhanced enforcement  additional limitations on use and disclosure of phi and additional potential penalties for non compliance 
see item a 
risk factors if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected for additional information about the risks related to privacy and security breaches 
the gramm leach bliley act generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their personal health and financial information is used and  in certain circumstances  the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares non public personal information with a non affiliated third party 
like hipaa  this law sets a floor standard  allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
erisa 
many employee benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
employment sponsored health coverage generally is such an employee benefit plan 
erisa is administered and regulated  in large part  by the us department of labor 
erisa contains disclosure requirements for documents that define benefits and coverage  among other requirements 
erisa also provides that  in certain instances  federal law will preempt state law in the regulation and governance of certain benefit plans and employer groups  including the availability of legal remedies under state law 
regulations established by the us department of labor provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by erisa 
other federal regulations 
we must comply with  and are affected by  laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of us government contracts 
government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and  in some instances  impose added costs on our business 
in addition  because of our activities to support our mflc contract and certain outsourcing arrangements we have with third party vendors  we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide anti corruption laws  including the uk bribery act of  which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
a violation of specific laws and regulations by us or our agents could result in  among other things  the imposition of fines and penalties on us  changes to our business practices  the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts

state laws and regulations our western region operations hmos  insurance companies and behavioral health plan are subject to extensive state regulation 
set forth below are the principal regulatory agencies that govern these health plans and insurance companies 
company regulatory agency arizona hmo arizona department of insurance california hmo california department of managed health care 
health net community solutions california department of health care services medi cal and the managed risk medical insurance board healthy families oregon hmo oregon department of consumer and business services health net life insurance company arizona and california ppo california department of insurance generally  and the department of insurance of each state in which it does business mhn california department of managed health care insurance and hmo laws impose a number of financial requirements and restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries  which vary from state to state 
they generally include certain minimum capital and deposit and or reserve requirements  restrictions on dividends and other distributions to the parent corporations and affiliated corporations 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources statutory capital requirements 
these financial requirements are subject to change  which may require us to commit additional capital to certain regulated subsidiaries or may limit our ability to move capital through dividends and other distributions 
while there are state by state variations  hmo regulation generally is extremely comprehensive 
among the areas regulated by these hmo regulatory agencies are adequacy of financial resources  network of health care providers and administrative operations  sales and enrollment requirements  disclosure documents and notice requirements  product offerings  including the scope of mandatory benefits and required offerings of benefits that are optional coverages  procedures for member grievance resolution and medical necessity determinations  accessibility of providers  handling of provider claims including out of network claims and adherence to timely and accurate payment and appeal rules  linguistic and cultural accessibility standards  governance requirements and reporting requirements  and implementation of some provisions of the aca 
ppo regulation also varies by state  and while these regulations generally cover all or most of the subject areas referred to above  the regulation of ppo products and carriers tends to be less intensive than regulation of hmos 
variations in state regulation also arise in connection with the intensity of government oversight 
variations include the need to file or have affirmatively approved certain proposals before use or implementation by the health plan  the degree of review and comment by the regulatory agency  the amount and type of reporting by the health plan to the regulatory agency  the extent and frequency of audit or other examination  and the authority and extent of investigative activity  enforcement action  corrective action authority  and penalties and fines 
in addition  as discussed in further detail above under the heading health care reform legislation  the aca requires the establishment of health insurance exchanges that will act as markets for the purchase of subsidized health insurance 
states were given the option of establishing these exchanges on their own or allowing the federal government to fully or partially operate the exchange 
california  washington and oregon have each chosen to operate their own exchanges while arizona has elected the establishment of a federally facilitated exchange 
participation in these and other exchanges in the states in which we operate may be conditioned on the approval of the applicable state or federal government regulator 
in some cases  the factors to be considered for inclusion on the exchanges have not yet been finalized or may be subject to change  which could result in the exclusion of some carriers from the exchanges 
our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to legal restrictions on our ability to price some of our products 
some products may be subject to regulatory approval of premium levels 
generally  insurance and hmo laws require premiums to be established at amounts reasonably related to our costs 
state regulations also may be more stringent than federal regulations that are applicable to us  and various health insurance reform proposals are emerging at the state level  including proposals and regulations that implement portions of the aca

federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
during the first quarter of  president obama signed into law both the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the aca  which is causing and will continue to cause significant changes to the us health care system and alter the dynamics of the health care insurance industry 
the legislation includes provisions  which  among other things will impose a significant non deductible tax technically taking the form of a fee on health insurers  effective for calendar years beginning after december  this health insurer fee will be assessed at a total of billion in  will increase thereafter and will be allocated pro rata amongst industry participants based on net premiums written  subject to certain exceptions 
payment of the health insurer fee will not be due until  however  it has started to impact us since our premium rates are set a year in advance  and the tax amounts for depend on net premiums written in additionally  regulations relating to the health insurer fee have not yet been issued by the internal revenue service irs  making related payment procedures  timing and financial reporting requirements unclear 
if we are not able to incorporate the costs of our pro rata portion of the health insurer fee when we set our premium rates  or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business to address this additional new cost  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  some of our competitors may have greater economies of scale  which  among other things  may lead to lower expense ratios and higher profit margins than we have 
since the health insurer fee is not tax deductible  it will generally represent a higher percentage of our profits  and therefore could impact us to a greater degree than these larger competitors 
moreover  some of our competitors  including  among others  government entities  certain non profits insurers and self funded plans  may not be required to pay the health insurer fee or may be required to pay only one half the rate we will be required to pay  which may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete effectively 
we may not be able to match our competitors ability to support reduced premiums by virtue of any full or partial exemptions from the fees and taxes imposed by the aca  or by making changes to their distribution arrangements  decreasing spending on non medical product features and services  or otherwise adjusting their operating costs and reducing general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the aca requires the establishment of state based or federally facilitated exchanges where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage 
california  oregon and washington  among others  have passed legislation that will make coverage by health plans on their respective exchanges effective in participation in these and other exchanges in the states in which we operate may be conditioned on the approval of the applicable state or federal government regulator 
in some cases  the factors to be considered for inclusion on the exchanges have not yet been finalized or may be subject to change  which could result in the exclusion of some carriers from the exchanges 
in addition  states and the federal government are continuing to finalize other rules and regulations related to the actual operation of the exchanges  including  without limitation  with respect to state and federal rate review for plans offered on the exchanges  federal subsidies for premiums  cost sharing reductions  mandated state essential health benefits  the operation of reinsurance  risk corridors and risk adjustment mechanisms and the ability of participating insurers to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small group employers outside the exchanges 
we have submitted bids to participate in certain exchanges  and intend to submit future bids in certain eligible counties  but due in part to the uncertainty and complexity of the regulatory environment surrounding the implementation of the exchanges  including  among other things  with respect to the required level of essential health benefits that must be provided by participants in the exchanges  there is no assurance that our bids or any participation in exchanges will be successful 
the developing regulatory structure for the exchanges will shape the marketplace for individual and small group health plans both within and outside the exchanges  and these changes will require us to modify our strategies and operations in response 
for example  we will need to adjust our product offerings and marketing and sales practices  including through the development of new tools  to adapt to the new direct to consumer distribution channels that will be introduced in the exchanges 
in response to these changes in the health care market  our competitors could modify their product features or benefits  change their pricing relative to others in the market and adjust their mix of business within or outside the exchanges  or even exit segments of the market 
new competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may also introduce product offerings or pricing that we may not be able to match  which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
see the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline for additional discussion on the risks related to the changing competitive landscape 
if we fail to effectively adapt our business strategy and operations to these evolving markets  including with respect to shifts in consumer interface  product offerings and the competitive landscape  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the aca also contains risk adjustment provisions applicable to the individual and small group markets that take effect in these risk adjustment provisions will effectively transfer funds from health plans with relatively lower risk enrollees to plans with relatively higher risk enrollees to help protect against adverse selection 
the individual and small group markets represent a significant portion of our commercial business and the relevant amounts transferred may be substantial 
effectively adapting to these risk adjustment provisions may require us to modify our operational and strategic initiatives to focus on and manage different populations of potential members than we have in the past 
in addition  the risk adjustment mechanism relies on encounter data to define a health plan average actuarial risk 
the process of collecting this data presents disadvantages to more heavily capitated health plans such as ours because providers receiving fixed fees from health insurers do not have the same incentive to provide accurate and complete encounter data with respect to services rendered when compared to providers under fee for service arrangements 
this incentive problem is particularly acute for health plans operating under the delegated hmo model  which is prevalent in our california health plans 
under this model  third party intermediaries assume responsibility for certain utilization management and care coordination responsibilities  including the collection of encounter data 
if we are not able to successfully design and implement operational and strategic initiatives to adapt to these changes in certain of our markets  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
for a further discussion regarding the aca and related legislation  including a description of certain of its key provisions and the proposed timetable for their implementation  see item business government regulation health care reform legislation 
various aspects of the aca will transform the operating and regulatory landscape in the markets in which we operate  and could have an adverse impact on the cost of operating our business  and our revenues  enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments 
for example  among other things  the aca will require premium rate review in certain market segments and will require that premium rebates be paid to policyholders in the event certain specified minimum medical loss ratios are not met 
we do not believe that we will be required to pay a material amount in rebates with respect to our business  however  we cannot be certain that we will not be required to pay material amounts in rebates in the future 
in addition  as part of the rate review process  certain insurers may be excluded from participating in the exchanges if the review determines that the insurer has demonstrated a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium rate increases 
the aca may also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain members  and will increase the amount of certain taxes and fees we pay  the latter of which is expected to increase our effective tax rate in future periods 
as noted above with respect to the health insurer fee  we are unable to estimate the amount of these fees and taxes or the increase in our effective tax rate because material information and guidance regarding the calculations of these fees and taxes has not been issued 
the sales tax on medical device manufacturers and increase in the amount of fees pharmaceutical manufacturers pay imposed by the aca  could  in turn  also increase our medical costs 
further  it is not yet clear how state regulators will respond to rate filings that include requests to increase premiums to cover increased costs resulting from the health insurer fee or any other portion of the aca  particularly in light of recent heightened regulatory scrutiny of premium rates 
in the event regulators take positions preventing or delaying health insurers from increasing premiums to reflect aca related costs  or if consumers forego coverage as a result of such premium increases  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
see we face competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices 
if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover our costs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for further information on how these increased costs and our related ability to increase premium prices could affect our profitability 
we also face additional competition as new competitors enter the marketplace and existing competitors seize on opportunities to expand their business as a result of the aca  including as discussed above with respect to the exchanges 
for example  among other things  aca provisions related to accountable care organizations  or acos  which are intended to create incentives for health care participants to work together to treat an individual across different care settings  may create opportunities for provider organizations to compete with us by assuming care management and other administrative responsibilities as part of a more integrated delivery system 
however  there remains considerable uncertainty about the impact of the aca on the health insurance market as a whole and what actions our competitors or potential competitors could take in response to the legislation 
for additional information  see the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
there are numerous steps required to implement the aca  and clarifying regulations and other guidance are expected over several years 
additional guidance and regulations on certain provisions of the aca have been issued  including proposed rules  but we are still awaiting further final guidance or regulations on a number of key provisions 
these provisions include certain aspects of the calculation of the health insurer fee as noted above  the risk adjustment  risk corridor and reinsurance programs  the limitation on deductibility of executive compensation and market reforms such as guaranteed availability  ratings reform and essential health benefits  among others 
the final regulations relating to the medicare shared savings program reflecting the use of acos have been issued  but as noted above  the impact of these new regulations on the health care market and the role to be played by health plans in the operation of acos remains to be determined 
moreover  though the federal government has in certain instances issued final regulations  including  for example  with respect to the exchanges  there remains considerable uncertainty around the ultimate requirements of the legislation  as the final regulations are sometimes unclear or incomplete  and are subject to further change 
as a result  many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for certain until the ultimate requirements of the aca have been definitively determined 
because of the magnitude  scope and complexity of the aca  we also need to dedicate substantial resources and incur material expenses to implement the legislation 
any delay or failure by us to execute our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to health care reform or otherwise appropriately react to the legislation  implementing regulations and actions of our competitors could result in operational disruptions  disputes with our providers or members  increased exposure to litigation  regulatory issues  damage to our existing or potential member relationships or other adverse consequences 
in addition  certain legal and legislative challenges to the aca remain despite the us supreme court june decision in nfib v 
sebelius and the november presidential and congressional elections 
in sebelius  the supreme court upheld the aca individual mandate as valid under congress taxing power 
the sebelius decision also permits states to opt out of the elements of the aca that require expansion of medicaid coverage in january without losing their existing federal medicaid funding 
although many states  such as california  may continue to consider extending coverage to the uninsured through medicaid expansions  the supreme court decision to overturn the part of the aca that conditions ongoing funding for medicaid on participation by states in the medicaid expansion may cause some states  such as arizona  to choose not to expand medicaid coverage as required in the initial legislation 
further  there is uncertainty as to how the supreme court decision will be interpreted at the federal and state levels  which has created greater uncertainty with regard to which states will choose to accept the medicaid expansion and the future size and scope of state medicaid programs 
medicaid expansion in california has not been formally addressed  but is generally expected to be approved in connection with the state budget process in notwithstanding sebelius  other legal challenges to the aca have been threatened or are still pending at lower court levels  which could result in portions of the aca being struck down 
these threatened and pending challenges include disputing the irs official position that premium tax credits are available to low income individuals who purchase insurance through federally facilitated exchanges 
a successful challenge in this area could significantly affect the affordability of insurance to low income individuals in states that do not administer their own exchanges  such as arizona 
finally  though legislative repeal of the aca is unlikely following the presidential and congressional elections  congress has proposed certain legislative initiatives that may affect certain provisions of the aca  such as with respect to certain subsidies available to low income individuals  and may attempt to amend or withhold the funding necessary to implement the aca 
any such amendment or withholding of aca funding  extended delays in the issuance of clarifying regulations and other guidance or other lingering uncertainty regarding the aca could cause us to incur additional costs of compliance or require us to significantly modify or adjust certain of the operational and strategic initiatives we have already established 
such modifications may result in the loss of some or all of the substantial resources that have been and will be invested in the aca implementation  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock 
due to the unsettled nature of the aca  its complexity  and the numerous steps required to implement it  we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of future regulations and laws  including state laws  implementing the aca 
depending in part on its ultimate requirements  the aca could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level  which could have an adverse impact on us 
various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level 
many of the states in which we operate are already implementing parts of the aca and many states have added new requirements that are more exacting than the aca requirements 
states may also mandate minimum medical loss ratios  implement rate reforms and enact benefit mandates that go beyond provisions included in the aca 
for example  while recently proposed california legislation requiring prior approval of premium rates by the california department of insurance the cdoi did not pass  an initiative measure in california to require prior approval for individual and small group rates by the cdoi has qualified for the ballot 
in addition  oversight boards associated with the state based exchanges in california  oregon and washington will negotiate the price of coverage sold on these exchanges 
these kinds of state regulations and legislation could limit or delay our ability to increase premiums even where actuarially supported and thereby could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
this also could increase the competition we face from companies that have lower health care or administrative costs than we do and therefore can price their premiums at lower levels than we can 
for additional information  see we face competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices 
if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover our costs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
further  the interaction of new federal regulations and the implementation efforts of the various states in which we do business will continue to create substantial uncertainty for us and other health insurance companies about the requirements under which we must operate 
even in cases where state action is limited to implementing federal reforms  new or amended state laws will be required in many cases  and we will be required to operate under and comply with the various laws of each of the states in which we operate 
states may disagree in their interpretations of the federal statute and regulations  and state guidance that is issued could be unclear or untimely 
in the case of the aca exchanges  we will be required to operate under and comply with the regulatory authority of the federal government in addition to the regimes of each of the states that establish and administer their own exchanges 
for example  while california  oregon and washington have passed legislation establishing their own state run exchanges  arizona has declared that it will not create a state run exchange and instead will rely on a federally facilitated exchange 
if we do not successfully implement the various state law requirements of the aca  including with respect to the exchanges  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict and control health care costs 
a substantial majority of the revenue we receive is used to pay the costs of health care services and supplies delivered to our members 
many of these costs  including costs associated with physician and hospital care  new medical technology and prescription drugs  for example  are rising 
the total amount of health care costs we incur is affected by the number and type of individual services we provide and the cost of each service 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict health care costs and to manage future health care utilization and costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management  product design and negotiation of favorable professional and hospital contracts 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs or limit our ability to negotiate favorable rates 
government imposed limitations on medicare and medicaid reimbursement have also caused  and are expected to continue to cause  the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs 
additionally  there is always the possibility that adverse risk selection could occur when members who utilize higher levels of health care services compared with the insured population as a whole choose to remain with our health plans rather than risk moving to another plan 
moreover  the introduction of new populations with which there is limited cost experience could adversely affect our ability to accurately predict or control health care costs 
any of these factors could cause our health care costs to be higher than anticipated and therefore cause our financial results to fall short of expectations 
for example  we experienced higher than expected commercial health care costs for the six months ended june  as a result of adverse development primarily due to significant delays in claims submissions for the fourth quarter of arising from issues related to a new billing format required by hipaa coupled with an unanticipated flattening of commercial trends and higher commercial large group claims trend 
other factors that may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs and  as a result  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows include but are not limited to changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  catastrophes  large scale public health epidemics  terrorist activity  unanticipated seasonality  changes in provider reimbursement  fluctuations in medical cost trends  the regulatory environment  including  for example  the implementation of the aca or other state or federal laws and their impact on our health care costs and our ability to change our premium rates  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  and continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups 
for additional detail on the impact on health care costs resulting from federal health care reform and potential additional changes in federal and state legislation and regulations  see federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations  various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level  which could have an adverse impact on us and a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a significant category of our health care costs is the cost of hospital based products and services 
factors underlying the increase in hospital costs include  but are not limited to  the underfunding of public programs  such as medicaid and medicare and the constant pressure that places on rates from commercial health plans  growing rates of uninsured individuals  new technology  state initiated mandates  alleged abuse of hospital chargemasters  an aging population  changes in the economic environment and  under certain circumstances  relatively low levels of hospital competition caused by market concentration 
another significant category of our health care costs is costs of pharmaceutical products and services 
factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of drugs  utilization of new and existing drugs  changes in discounts and the impact of health care reform on pharmaceutical manufacturers through such requirements as increased fees 
as a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for our health plan products  our annual pre tax income for would have been reduced by approximately million 
the inability to accurately forecast and manage our health care costs in all circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our inability to estimate and maintain appropriate levels of reserves for claims may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our reserves for claims are estimates of incurred costs based on a number of assumptions 
an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process and considerable variability is inherent in such estimates 
the accuracy of these estimates also may be affected by external forces such as  for example  changes in medical claims submissions and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
included in the reserves for claims are estimates for the costs of services that have been incurred but not reported ibnr and for claims received but not processed 
our methodology for calculating these estimates is consistently applied from period to period  and our ibnr best estimate is made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required 
any adjustments to the prior period ibnr best estimates are included in the current period 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our assumptions accordingly to change our estimate of ibnr 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts reserved 
if such a revision in our estimates results in significant unfavorable development  it could adversely affect current period net income  profitability per enrolled member and  subsequently  our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period 
our stock price could also be negatively impacted 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of adverse claims development primarily due to higher than expected costs for prior periods as a result of significant delays in claims submissions for the fourth quarter of arising from issues related to a new billing format required by hipaa coupled with an unanticipated flattening of commercial medical claims trends and higher than expected commercial large group claims trends 
if our actual claims liability is lower than estimated  it could mean that we set premium prices too high  which could result in a loss of membership 
for additional information regarding our methodology in establishing our reserves for claims and other settlements  see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates 
we face competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices 
if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover our costs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  price has been and will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
any future increase in our premiums could result in the loss of members  particularly in light of continued economic pressures and the implementation of the aca 
our premiums are set in advance of the actual delivery of services  and  in certain circumstances  before contracting with providers 
while we attempt to take into account our estimate of expected health care and other costs over the premium period in setting the premiums we charge or bid  factors such as competition  new or changed regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs 
for example  certain of our competitors may not be subject to the aca health insurer fee or may be assessed at half the rate that we and other health insurers will pay 
as a result  if we attempt to cover our increased costs from the health insurer fee through corresponding increases in our premium rates  we may not remain price competitive in the marketplace  including in the new health care exchanges 
in addition  many factors may  and often do  cause actual health care costs to exceed those costs estimated and reflected in premiums or bids 
these factors include  but are not limited to  increased utilization rates  increasing medical cost trends  catastrophes  public health epidemics  terrorist activity  unanticipated seasonality  changes in insured population characteristics  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  including those included in the aca or other state or federal laws 
if we are unable to accurately estimate costs and set our premiums accordingly  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  our ability to increase our premiums may be restricted by law 
for example  the aca requires the establishment of a process for review of unreasonable premium rate increases 
as part of this rate review process  certain insurers may be excluded from participating in the state based or federally facilitated exchanges created by the aca if the review determines that the insurer has demonstrated a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium rate increases 
the federal government and some states in which we do business have also required prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases and or have subjected such increases to heightened scrutiny  such as third party review 
for example  the cdoi and department of managed health care require a third party actuarial review of health insurance carriers and health plans proposed premium rate increases to confirm compliance with applicable law  resulting in a potential delay in carriers and plans ability to implement rate increases 
further  in california  proponents of rate review have qualified an initiative measure for the november ballot that would  if approved  impose significant additional requirements on health plans relating to premium increases 
these requirements and proposed changes have in the past and could in the future  among other things  lower the amount of premium increases we receive or extend the amount of time that it takes for us to obtain regulatory approval to implement increases in our premium rates 
certain of our competitors were asked by the commissioner of the cdoi to voluntarily delay implementation of scheduled premium increases to permit additional review by the cdoi  which review led the carriers to reduce proposed rate increases 
we have experienced  and are likely to continue to experience  greater scrutiny by regulators of proposed increases to our premium rates 
for additional detail on the impact of federal health care reform and potential additional changes in federal and state legislation and regulations on our ability to maintain or increase premium levels  see federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations and various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level  which could have an adverse impact on us 
our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by significant disparities between the premium increases of our health plans and those of our major competitors or by limitations on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels 
the aca and other federal and state legislation and regulations also constrain the medical loss ratios maintained by managed health care companies such as us 
the aca requires premium rebates to the extent that minimum medical loss ratios are not met 
we do not believe that we will be required to pay a material amount in rebates with respect to our business  however  we cannot be certain that we will not be required to pay material amounts in rebates in the future 
in the various states in which we do business  premium prices are also constrained by state laws and regulations that restrict the spread between premiums and benefits  such as laws and regulations that require a minimum loss ratio of a certain percentage 
these laws and regulations not only restrict our ability to raise our premiums but also create additional competitive pressure from some of our competitors who may have lower health care costs than we have and therefore price their premiums at relatively low levels in relation to our cost of care 
these laws and regulations also have generated  and could continue to generate  substantial media attention and strong public opinion 
this may create a more conservative regulatory environment  thereby either delaying any rate increases that we propose or further restraining our ability to price at levels that can adequately cover our cost and margin goals 
see federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations and various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level  which could have an adverse impact on us 
the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
we are in a highly competitive industry that is currently subject to significant changes from  among other things  legislative reform  business consolidations and new strategic alliances 
many of our competitors may have certain characteristics  capabilities or resources  such as greater market share  greater economies of scale  superior provider and supplier arrangements and existing business relationships  which give them an advantage in competing with us 
these competitors include hmos  ppos  self funded employers  insurance companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers 
in addition  other companies may enter our markets in the future 
the addition of new competitors in our industry can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
for example  the new developing marketplace created by the aca state based and federally facilitated exchanges may encourage new market participants and lead to increased competition in the individual and small group markets 
there also is a risk that our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services currently provided by us  which could result in a decrease in our revenues 
in addition  our providers and suppliers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
see federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the impact of health care reform on the competitive landscape 
in addition  the response to the aca by our existing competitors and related adjustments to their offerings  if any  could cause meaningful disruption in local health care markets in which we operate 
for example  certain state based and federally facilitated exchanges mandated by the aca will commence operations in  and the developing regulatory structure for these exchanges will shape the marketplace for individual and small group health plans both within and outside the exchanges 
these changes will require us and our competitors to modify strategies and operations in response 
among other things  we will need to adjust our marketing and sales practices to adapt to the new direct to consumer distribution channels that will be introduced in the exchanges 
in response to these and other changes in the health care market  our competitors could modify their product features or benefits  change their pricing relative to others in the market and adjust their mix of business within or outside the exchanges  or even exit segments of the market 
we may not be able to match our competitors ability to support reduced premiums by virtue of any full or partial exemptions from the fees and taxes imposed by the aca  or by making changes to their distribution arrangements  decreasing spending on non medical product features and services  or otherwise adjusting their operating costs and reducing general and administrative expenses 
new competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may also introduce product offerings or pricing that we may not be able to match  which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
for additional discussion of how the aca may affect the competitive landscape in which we operate  see federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
in recent years  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in our industry and in industries that act as our suppliers  such as the hospital  medical group  pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
this activity may create stronger competitors and or result in higher health care costs 
furthermore  the adoption of the aca could further increase the likelihood of provider consolidation  which in turn could make it more difficult for us to negotiate competitive rates 
in addition  our contracts with government agencies  such as our t contract for the tricare north region and mflc contracts  are from time to time up for re bid 
if we were to lose any significant government contract to a competitor  such as the t contract for the tricare north region and mflc contracts  or if we were to win the bid for such contract on less favorable terms  it could have an adverse effect on our profitability  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in august  we concluded the competitive rebidding process for our mflc contract 
under the original mflc contract  we were the sole contractor to provide behavioral health services to military families under the department of defense mflc program 
as a result of the revised terms and structure of the second generation mflc contract and the government decision to award the second generation mflc contract to multiple contractors  we expect that the revenues we receive from the new contract will be substantially reduced in comparison to the original mflc contract 
see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for more information regarding our government contracts  including our t contract for the tricare north region and our mflc contract 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase our number of customers  our revenue growth  our pricing flexibility  our control over medical cost trends and our marketing expenses may all be adversely affected 
in  we experienced higher than expected commercial health care costs  particularly in select large group commercial accounts  primarily as a result of competitive pricing practices in many of the markets where we operate and unexpected risk deterioration among these select large group accounts 
in response  we repositioned our commercial business in for to either obtain better pricing for these accounts or  in some cases  to discontinue business with them 
our strategy remains focused on growing membership in tailored network products that provide lower cost options to our members and employer groups 
growth in our tailored network products and the continued development of innovative provider relationships are important parts of our business strategy 
for example  we have been working to build alliances with provider groups and other stakeholders in the health care system through shared risk arrangements  including acos  that have seen increasing support as state and federal governments and the health care industry seek to improve the quality of care while controlling the costs of such care 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for health care reform and future profitable growth  that the products we design in collaboration with certain providers will be successful or developed within the time periods expected  or that the products that we offer will be preferable to similar products of our competitors 
failure to successfully implement these strategies may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if we do not design and price our products appropriately and competitively  if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets  if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products  if we do not provide satisfactory service levels  if membership or demand for our services does not increase as we expect or if membership or demand for our services declines  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our businesses are subject to laws and significant rules and regulations  which increases our cost of doing business and could impact our financial performance by restricting our ability to conduct business or adversely affecting our ability to grow our businesses 
our businesses are subject to extensive federal and state laws  rules  and regulations  including  but not limited to  financial requirements  licensing requirements  enrollment requirements and periodic examinations by governmental agencies 
our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations relating to cash reserves  minimum net worth  premium rates  approval of policy language and benefits  appeals and grievances with respect to benefit determinations  provider contracting  utilization management  issuance and termination of policies  claims payment practices and a wide variety of other regulations relating to the development and operation of health plans 
these laws  rules  and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders of managed health care companies such as health net 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses 
the laws  rules  and regulations governing our business and interpretations of those laws  rules  and regulations are subject to frequent change  and there is no guarantee that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering these laws  rules  and regulations to interpret them and to impose substantial fines or restrict our ability to do business when they believe violations or failures to meet standards or requirements have occurred 
regulatory agencies  such as the california department of managed health care  the california department of health care services  cms  the us department of health human services office of civil rights and state departments of insurance  have the authority to impose substantial fines and or penalties against us  require us to change how we do business and restrict our business activities 
certain of these agencies have done so in the past  and may impose substantial fines and or penalties against us  require us to change how we do business and restrict our business activities in the future if they determine that we have not complied with applicable laws  rules  and regulations 
further  such fines  penalties and restrictions may be more severe in circumstances in which regulatory agencies determine that we have repeatedly failed to comply with applicable laws  rules or regulations 
see federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows for further discussion on the impact of any fines  penalties or restrictions that may be imposed against us 
as we have members in various states and are therefore subject to the regulatory oversight of multiple jurisdictions  we have been in the past  and could be in the future  subject to fines and or penalties imposed by multiple regulatory agencies relating to the same incident 
existing or future laws  rules  and regulations  including the aca and related health care reform initiatives could  among other things  force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs  and or increase our exposure to liability with respect to members  providers or others 
see federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations  and various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level  which could have an adverse impact on us 
further  we may be liable for violations of laws  rules and regulations by individual health net associates notwithstanding our internal policies and compliance programs 
for example  see if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a federal and state government contractor  we are subject to us and state government oversight 
the government may investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  a negative determination resulting from such claims could result in a contractor being fined  debarred and or suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
in addition  we are subject to state and federal false claims laws that generally prohibit the submission of false claims for reimbursement or payment to government agencies 
we are also subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti corruption laws  including the uk bribery act of  which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
courts have imposed substantial fines and penalties against companies found to have violated these laws 
we are also exposed to other risks associated with us and state government contracting  including but not limited to dependence upon congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds  the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow  and the general ability of federal and or state government to terminate contracts with it  in whole or in part  without prior notice  for convenience or for default based on performance 
in addition  delays in obtaining  or failure to obtain or maintain  governmental approvals  or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities  could adversely affect our revenue or membership  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we will not be able to participate in the duals demonstration portion of the california coordinated care initiative in los angeles county or san diego county unless a number of objectives and conditions are met 
in  the california legislature enacted the coordinated care initiative cci in eight california counties  which will establish a voluntary three year duals demonstration program to coordinate medical  behavioral health  long term institutional  and home and community based services for individuals that are fully eligible for medicare and medi cal benefits dual eligibles through a single health plan 
the cci will also require that all medi cal beneficiaries in participating counties join a medi cal managed care health plan to receive their medi cal benefits  including long term services and supports ltss  which includes institutional long term care and home and community based services and other support services 
on april   dhcs selected us to participate in the cci for both los angeles county and san diego county 
for further discussion of the cci  see item business segment information western region operations segment california coordinated care initiative 
our participation in the cci  and the duals demonstration in particular  represents a significant new business opportunity for us 
however  we will not be able to participate in the cci in either los angeles or san diego county unless a number of objectives and conditions are met including  among others  the following cms and dhcs negotiating and finalizing a memorandum of understanding with respect to the cci  and the subsequent satisfactory completion of a readiness assessment by cms and dhcs  our entry into a contract on satisfactory terms  including  without limitation  satisfactory rates  with the dhcs and cms for the cci  necessary modifications to our internal administrative and operations structure to meet the demands of the cci  including  without limitation  hiring new staff to run programs  implementing systems modifications  establishing new provider networks and making arrangements to provide ltss either directly or by subcontracting with other parties  with all such modifications in compliance with both medicare and medi cal regulatory regimes  and the absence of changes in laws or regulations negatively impacting the implementation of the cci 
certain of these conditions are outside of our control and there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet all of the objectives and conditions necessary for our participation in the cci in los angeles county  san diego county or both 
in addition  as noted above  the changes to our administrative and operations structure will include implementing delivery systems for benefits with which we have limited operating experience  including ltss 
see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for additional information on risks related to participation in government programs 
we expect that we will incur material incremental costs to prepare for the cci 
if we do not participate in the cci in either county  this would result in the loss of some or all of the resources that have been and will be invested in this opportunity and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock 
if we participate in the california coordinated care initiative in los angeles county and or san diego county  this business opportunity may prove to be unsuccessful for a number of reasons 
the cci is a model of providing health care that is new to regulatory authorities and health plans in the state of california 
our participation and success in the cci will be subject to a number of risks inherent in untested health care initiatives 
for example  there may be difficulties in the implementation of the duals demonstration that could detract from its acceptance by beneficiaries or increase our costs of participation in the duals demonstration 
in addition  our participation in the cci will require us to provide benefits with which we have limited operating experience  including but not limited to ltss 
our failure to organize and deliver on this new model would negatively affect the operating and financial success of this business opportunity 
some of the risks involved in our participation in the cci include dual eligibles are generally among the most chronically ill individuals within each of medicare and medi cal  requiring a complex range of services from multiple providers 
if we do not accurately predict the costs of providing benefits to dual eligibles or fail to obtain suitable rates under our agreement with cms and dhcs  our participation in the cci may prove to be unprofitable 
we may not be able to effectively design and implement the necessary modifications to our internal administrative and operations structure to meet the demands of the cci  which may negatively impact our profitability in the cci and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  our profitability in the cci will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully provide and administer ltss benefits  either directly or by subcontracting with other parties 
because we have limited operating experience in providing and administering this benefit  particularly with respect to cost management  there is no assurance that we will be able to make such arrangements on favorable terms  which may adversely affect our results of operations  particularly as our medi cal membership may increase through  among other things  potential medicaid expansion in california 
dual eligibles will have the option to opt out of the duals demonstration while retaining all of their medi cal benefits under cci  including ltss  which may reduce or eliminate the inherent efficiencies of the duals demonstration portion of the cci 
in particular  while the provision and administration of ltss benefits may increase medi cal costs  successfully managing care for these ltss recipients may generate equal or greater medicare savings in the form of reduced costs for treatment for acute conditions and or hospitalizations 
however  if large numbers of dual eligibles opt out of the duals demonstration  we may be unable to capitalize on such potential efficiencies in the dual demonstration portion of the cci  and as a result  we may not be able to maximize our investment in the cci and our profitability with respect to our participation in the cci may be adversely affected 
in each county  we will be offered as one of the choices of the health plans selected to participate in the cci 
dual eligibles in each county will be able to select to receive benefits from any of the participating health plans 
as a result of competitive factors  we may not attract a satisfactory number of dual eligibles 
the duals demonstration is scheduled to end after a three year term beginning no sooner than september  the commencement of the cci  including the duals demonstration  has been subject to prior delay  and it is possible that the commencement of the cci could be further delayed as a result of a number of factors beyond our control 
also  after completion of the duals demonstration  the duals portion of the cci may not continue or we may not be able to participate in the cci if enacted in additional counties 
we will be required to make required filings with  and obtain approvals from  regulatory authorities in order to meet the demands of the cci 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain these approvals on satisfactory terms  or at all 
we will be subject to various other risks and uncertainties associated with participating in government programs such as medicare and medi cal 
see medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk  a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows 
accordingly  if we participate in the cci  there can be no assurance that this business opportunity will prove to be successful 
our failure to successfully participate in the cci could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk 
medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business  accounting for approximately of our total premium revenue in our western region operations reportable segment in and an expected in the aca includes  among other things  provisions that will significantly reduce the government medicare payment rates 
for more information on the risks associated with the aca  see federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
provisions of the aca  including the reduction in medicare payment rates  may have an adverse effect on our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  all parts of the medicare program  including medicare advantage  could be subject to significant spending reductions in connection with the budget control act of for additional detail on these cuts and the potential effect on our medicare business  see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants  if our medicare operations are subject to sanctions or penalties  if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts  or if our existing contracts are terminated  our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected  negatively impacting our financial performance 
there are also specific additional risks under title xviii  part d of the social security act associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits as part of our medicare advantage plan offerings 
these risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables  inadequacy of pricing assumptions  inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs  as well as the underlying seasonality of this business  and extended settlement periods for claims submissions 
our failure to comply with part d program requirements can result in financial and or operational sanctions on our part d products  as well as on our medicare advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage 
in connection with our participation in the medicare advantage and part d programs  we regularly record revenues associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by cms 
this mechanism is designed to appropriately reimburse health plans for the relative health care cost risk of its medicare enrollees 
under the cms risk adjustment methodology  all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit diagnosis code data from hospitals and physician providers to cms by specified deadlines 
cms uses this diagnosis information to calculate the risk adjusted premium paid to medicare advantage plans throughout the year 
for any given year  the final settlement of these risk adjustment payments is generally made in the second or third quarter of the following year 
because the recorded revenue associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism is based on our best estimate at the time  the actual payment we receive from cms for risk adjustment reimbursement settlements may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements 
see federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows for information on our recent cms audits and potential audits of the provider medical data supporting the risk adjustment payments that we receive for our medicare members 
in addition  cms developed the medicare advantage star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans  awarding between one and five stars to medicare advantage plans based on certain measures of quality 
the star ratings are used by cms to award quality based payments to medicare advantage plans 
beginning with the star rating  calculated in the fall of  medicare advantage plans that achieve a minimum of stars will receive a quality based payment in quality based payments related to the  and benefit years have been based on a quality based payment demonstration 
the methodology and measures used in the star ratings system are changed annually and star ratings thresholds are based on performance of medicare advantage plans nationally 
for the payment year  our california and oregon hmo and california ppo contracts with cms were measured at stars and our arizona hmo and oregon ppo contracts were measured at stars under the star ratings system 
we are continuing to make efforts to improve our star ratings and other quality measures  but a failure to achieve a star rating  and consequently to receive a quality based payment in any year  would have an adverse effect on our revenue  income and reputation  and could hinder our ability to compete effectively in the medicare marketplace 
a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
approximately of our total revenues relate to federal  state and local government health care coverage or counseling programs  such as medicare  medicaid  tricare and mflc 
nearly all of the revenues in our government contracts reportable segment  which does not include medicare and medicaid related revenues  come from the federal government  either directly or as a sub contractor for a federal government contract 
see item business segment information and item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for more information regarding our reportable segments 
in addition  a growing portion of our revenues for our western region operations reportable segment  which includes medicare and medi cal related revenues  relates to government programs  and this portion could increase if we are able to successfully pursue opportunities under the cci and other government programs  including any expansion of the medi cal program as a result of the aca 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations western region operations reportable segment california coordinated care initiative and if we participate in the california coordinated care initiative in los angeles county and or san diego county  this business opportunity may prove to be unsuccessful for a number of reasons for more information regarding our opportunities under the cci and related risks 
due to this concentration of revenues  a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our contracts with the government are generally subject to a highly structured competitive bid process and government discretion in the negotiation process  including with respect to performance requirements 
if we fail to design and maintain programs attractive to our government customers  if we are not successful in winning new contracts or contract renewals  or if our existing contracts are terminated  our current government health care coverage or counseling programs business and our ability to expand these businesses could be materially and adversely affected 
under government funded health programs  the government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels and generally has the ability to terminate our contract for convenience 
if the government payor reduces premium or reimbursement levels  such as medicare advantage payment rates as provided in the aca  delays payments to us or increases premiums by less than our costs increase  and we are unable to make offsetting adjustments through supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  we could be adversely affected 
in addition  the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements for our government contracts reportable segment represents our best estimate of the government liability to us under tricare  mflc and other government contracts  or amounts due us as a sub contractor 
these government receivables are generally estimates subject to government audit and negotiation  and there is an inherent uncertainty in government contracts based in large part on a vulnerability to disagreements with the government 
as a result  the final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts for our government contracts reportable segment may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize in our consolidated financial statements 
medicare revenue that we record may also be subject to change due to risk adjustment reimbursement settlements 
for additional information  see medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk 
contracts under our government programs are generally subject to frequent change  including but not limited to changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs  as applicable  under such programs 
an enrollment freeze or significant reduction in payments from government programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
such changes are more likely during re competition of government contracts 
for example  prior to august  we were the sole contractor providing behavioral health services to military families under the department of defense sponsored mflc program 
under the current mflc contract that we entered into in august  we are one of three contractors initially selected to participate in the mflc program 
as a result of the revised terms and structure of the new mflc contract and the government decision to award the new mflc contract to multiple contractors  we expect that the revenues we receive from the new contract will be substantially reduced in comparison to the original mflc contract 
for additional information on our mflc contract see item business segment information government contracts segment other department of defense contracts 
furthermore  the t contract for our tricare business has two remaining one year option periods  and if all remaining option periods are exercised  the t contract would conclude on march  however  there can be no assurance that the department of defense will exercise all of the remaining option periods under the contract  and if all of the option periods are not exercised  and our tricare business is opened up for rebidding  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
for additional information on our tricare operations  see item business segment information government contracts segment tricare 
in addition  the reimbursement rates we receive from federal and state governments relating to our government funded health care coverage programs may be subject to change 
for example  on february   cms announced preliminary medicare advantage benchmark payment rates that  if enacted as proposed  would reduce medicare advantage and part d payments that we receive in connection with our participation in these programs 
the proposed rates are subject to a public comment period  and final rates are expected to be released on april  furthermore  in response to a recent history of budget deficits  the state of california enacted proposed spending cuts for services as part of its budget as authorized by california assembly bill ab 
in october  cms approved certain elements of ab  which include a percent reduction in a number of provider reimbursement rates for medi cal 
following a series of legal challenges to ab that enjoined its implementation  the cuts have again been reflected in the california budget proposal announced in january while the implementation of ab remains subject to appeal in the ninth us circuit court of appeals  and the budget proposal is subject to change prior to its approval by the california legislature  if the cuts are implemented as currently proposed  they would be applied as of april  however  the impact of such cuts could be limited since they would need to be reconciled with minimum payment rates for primary care physicians dictated by the aca for and therefore  due to the uncertainty regarding the final implementation of ab  we cannot reasonably estimate whether there will be reductions in premiums and or related health care cost recoveries nor can we estimate the range of any such reductions that may result in connection with ab as another example of our changing reimbursement rates  the state of california decision to transition its healthy families program members into medi cal beginning in january will effectively reduce our reimbursement rates  as the rates we receive for medi cal members are lower than those we have received through the healthy families program 
any significant reduction in the reimbursement rates that we receive in connection with our government funded health care coverage programs could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  particularly as our membership in and focus on government programs increases 
furthermore  on august   the budget control act of was enacted in order to increase the federal government debt limit and reduce the federal deficit 
the budget control act established a member joint committee of congress known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction the joint select committee 
the joint select committee was tasked with proposing legislation to reduce the united states federal deficit by trillion for fiscal years by december  because the joint select committee did not pass such legislation by the proposed deadline  approximately trillion in domestic and defense spending reductions were to be automatically implemented beginning on january  the implementation of such reductions is scheduled to begin on march  as a result of the american taxpayer relief act of if implemented as currently proposed  these reductions would be split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
medicare would be subject to these automatic spending reductions  subject to a cap 
all parts of the medicare program  including medicare advantage  could be subject to cuts  but it is unclear how they would be applied 
if medicare reimbursement rates from the federal government are cut  it could have an adverse impact on our medicare business 
for additional information on the risks associated with our medicare program  see medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk 
in addition  while the nature of the proposed reductions in defense spending are unknown  they could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by  among other things  terminating or materially changing such programs  or by decreasing or delaying payments made under such programs 
federal and state governments could also choose to require benefits to be delivered to new populations of potential members or require us to deliver new services to existing populations 
if we have limited cost experience with these new populations or services  we may not be able to accurately predict or adequately control the associated health care costs 
for example  california began mandatory medi cal enrollment of spds in june  and the higher than expected claims experience in this population contributed in part to higher than expected health care costs we reported in in addition  as part of the cci  we will be required to expand our current medi cal offerings to provide ltss benefits to all our existing medi cal members  including spds and those who do not participate in the duals demonstration portion of the cci 
we have limited operating experience in providing this benefit and will need to make arrangements to provide such services either directly or by subcontracting with other parties prior to the commencement of the cci 
if we are unable to effectively make such arrangements on favorable terms or otherwise fail to adequately administer this new benefit  including successfully managing the associated costs  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
for additional detail on the cci  see item business segment information western region operations segment california coordinated care initiative 
in addition  medicaid expansion in california  which is generally expected to be formally adopted in connection with the budget process in  has the potential to significantly increase medi cal enrollment across the state of california 
the state of california has also commenced the phase out of its healthy families program and has started transitioning these members to medi cal 
each of these new populations of potential members may have different characteristics than our existing medi cal population 
if we do not effectively transition these members into medi cal  or if we otherwise do not effectively incorporate these new populations into our medi cal business  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
other changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to manage our general and administrative expenses  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
the level of our administrative expenses can affect our profitability  and we may not be able to manage our administrative expense in all circumstances 
in addition  many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources  higher revenues and greater economies of scale than we do  which among other things  may allow them to more successfully manage their general and administrative expense ratios 
while we attempt to effectively manage such expenses  including through the development of online functionalities and other projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  increases in staff related and other administrative expenses may occur from time to time 
these increases could be caused by any number of things  including difficulties or delays in projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  reliance on outsourced services  acquisitions and divestitures  business or product start ups or expansions  such as  for example  our potential participation in the cci  changes in business or regulatory requirements  including compliance with the aca  icd and hipaa regulations  or other reasons 
in addition  any failure to appropriately manage our general and administrative expenses could impact our ability to satisfy minimum medical loss ratio requirements  including those specified in the aca 
during recent years we have dedicated significant resources to implement programs designed to achieve general and administrative cost savings and improve our operational performance 
as a part of these programs  we have and will continue to contract with key strategic partners in an effort to lower our cost structure and incremental costs and consolidate business and management operations 
in addition  we are continuing to explore further opportunities to outsource certain other business process functions 
however  there can be no assurance that our strategies to reduce our general and administrative costs and improve our operational performance will be successful or achieve anticipated savings 
in addition  in order to offset some of the reduced revenues from the t contract and in connection with the sale of our medicare pdp business  we must reduce  reallocate or eliminate certain overhead and other administrative expenses 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in making these cuts and adjustments at a pace that will maintain or increase our profitability 
our business is regionally concentrated in the states of california  arizona and oregon 
our business operations are primarily concentrated in three states california  particularly southern california  arizona and oregon 
all of our medicaid operations are in the state of california  with a high concentration of operations and members in los angeles county 
due to this geographic concentration  in particular in southern california  we are exposed to the risk of a deterioration in our financial results if our health plans in these areas  in particular  southern california  experience significant losses 
in addition  our financial results could be adversely affected by economic conditions in these areas 
if the challenging economic conditions in the state of california or in the other states in which we operate do not materially improve or deteriorate further  we may experience reductions in existing and new business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if reimbursement payments from a state are significantly delayed  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
for example  in the past  budget issues have led the state of california to delay certain of its monthly medicaid payments to us 
any such irregularity in the timing of these payments in future periods may adversely impact our operating cash flow from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of such payments 
federal and state audits  reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have been and  in some cases  currently are  involved in various federal and state governmental audits  reviews and investigations 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by government agencies  state insurance and health and welfare departments and others pertaining to financial performance  market conduct and regulatory compliance issues 
such audits  reviews and investigations could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate or enroll members in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions  which could be substantial 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation  audit results  sanctions or penalties could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell our products and services 
state attorneys general have become increasingly active in investigating the activities of health plans  and we have received in the past  and may continue to receive in the future  subpoenas and other requests for information as part of these investigations 
we have  among other things  entered into consent agreements relating to  and in some instances have agreed to pay fines in connection with  several recent audits and investigations 
many regulatory audits  reviews and investigations in recent years have focused on the timeliness and accuracy of claims payments by managed care companies and health insurers 
our subsidiaries have been the subject of audits  reviews and investigations of this nature 
depending on the circumstances and the specific matters reviewed  regulatory findings could require remediation of any claims payment errors and payment of penalties of material amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
from time to time  cms audits certain medicare advantage plans  including ours  to validate the coding practices and the supporting documentation maintained by health care providers to support risk adjustment payments made to plans pursuant to their medicare advantage contracts 
we utilize claims submissions  medical records and other medical data as provided by health care providers as the basis for payment requests that we submit to cms under the risk adjustment model for our medicare advantage contracts 
cms may conduct risk adjustment data validation radv contract level audits for payment years or later 
on february   cms published its final payment error calculation methodology for such radv audits 
the final methodology provides for payment recovery based on extrapolated estimates of payment error rates 
in the event of such an audit  cms may require payment from health net based on any error estimate 
any such risk adjustment payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the laws and regulations governing the audits for these risk adjustment payments are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  it is possible that our recorded revenue estimates with respect to risk adjustment payments may change by a material amount 
for additional detail on the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by cms and risks associated with our medicare business  see medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk 
we have been sanctioned in the past by cms and have been advised that we will be subject to targeted monitoring and heightened surveillance and oversight by cms going forward 
any future sanctions  fines or penalties against our medicare operations may be more severe as a result of our past performance  particularly in circumstances in which cms determines that we have repeatedly failed to comply with applicable laws  rules or regulations 
if cms were to impose financial or other penalties and or sanctions on us  or terminate our existing medicare contracts  this could have a material adverse effect on our medicare business  our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
see medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk for additional information about our medicare programs and the associated risks 
we contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions 
violations of  or noncompliance with  laws and or regulations governing our business by such third parties  or governing our dealings with such parties  could subject us to additional audits  reviews and investigations and adverse effects from such audits  reviews and investigations 
in addition  from time to time  government agencies investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with regulations applicable to government contractors  including but not limited to regular audits to enforce mandatory pricing arrangements 
government investigations of us  whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons  could result in administrative  civil or criminal liabilities  including repayments  fines and or penalties being imposed upon us  or could lead to suspension or debarment from government programs or future government contracting  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
see we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties for additional detail regarding risks associated with our relationships with third parties 
we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  we incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity could be adversely affected if litigation expenses are greater than we project 
we have been in the past  are currently  or may become in the future  subject to a variety of legal actions  including but not limited to claims related to the insurance industry in general and our business in particular  such as claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide health care  poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged  improper rescission  termination or non renewal of coverage  and insufficient payments for out of network services 
these legal actions also include claims brought against companies in general  including  but not limited to employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  wage and hour claims  including  without limitation  cases involving allegations of misclassification of employees and or failure to pay for off the clock work  breach of contract actions  tort claims  fraud and misrepresentation claims  shareholder suits  including suits for securities fraud  intellectual property and real estate related disputes  and claims arising from or in connection with acquisitions  divestitures and other significant transactions  including but not limited to actions to block or unwind such transactions 
in addition  we incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability claims by employer groups for return of premiums  claims by providers  including claims for withheld or otherwise insufficient compensation or reimbursement  claims related to self funded business and claims related to reinsurance matters  and claims alleging information security incidents and breaches 
for example  we currently are party to various putative class action lawsuits filed in federal and state courts in connection with our announcement that certain server drives containing protected health information or personally identifying information of certain individuals are unaccounted for in connection with the migration of our data center to a facility owned and operated by a third party vendor 
these actions assert a variety of legal claims  including claims under the california confidentiality of medical information act  and seek damages under that statute as well as other compensatory damages  restitution  injunctive relief and attorneys fees 
see item legal proceedings and if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected for additional information 
the legal actions to which we are currently and in the future could be subject can also include allegations of fraud  misrepresentation  unfair or improper business practices and violations of state or federal antitrust laws and can include claims for punitive damages and various forms of injunctive relief 
also  there are currently  and may be in the future  attempts to bring class action lawsuits against various managed care organizations  including us 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are also being sought 
we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty  and we have in the past and continue to incur significant expenses in the defense of litigation matters  including without limitation  substantial discovery costs 
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of the types of claims we face 
there is a risk that we could incur substantial legal fees and expenses  including discovery expenses  in any of the actions we defend in excess of any amounts budgeted for defense 
plaintiffs attorneys have increasingly used expansive electronic discovery requests as a litigation tactic 
responding to these requests  the scope of which may exceed the normal capacity of our historical systems for archiving and organizing electronic documents  may require application of significant resources and impose significant costs on us 
in certain cases  we could also be subject to awards of substantial legal fees and costs to plaintiffs counsel 
while we currently have insurance policies that may provide coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation matters  there can be no assurance that coverage will be available for any particular case or liability 
insurers could dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded or settlement amounts 
in addition  certain liabilities  such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance 
insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level that would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
the deductible on our errors and omissions e o insurance has reached such a level 
given the amount of the deductible  the only cases which would be covered by our e o insurance are those involving claims that substantially exceed our average claim values and otherwise qualify for coverage under the terms of the insurance policy 
we regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us  including those described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
we record reserves and accrue costs for certain significant legal proceedings which represent our best estimate of the probable loss  including related future legal costs  for such matters  both known and unknown 
however  our recorded amounts might differ materially from the ultimate amount of any such costs 
the costs associated with any settlement of or judgment relating to the various legal proceedings to which we are or may be subject from time to time  such as the proceedings described in note  could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in a significant earnings charge or impact on our cash flow in any particular quarter 
the costs associated with any settlement of or judgment relating to the various legal proceedings to which we are or may be subject from time to time  such as the proceedings described in note  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity and may affect our reputation 
we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
we currently contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions 
these third parties provide a material amount of services to us  and include  but are not limited to  information technology infrastructure and applications solutions providers  medical management providers  claims administration providers  billing and enrollment providers  third party providers of actuarial services  call center providers and specialty service providers 
we are continuing to explore further opportunities to outsource certain other business process functions  such as in the area of information technology 
our current and any future arrangements with third party vendors and service providers may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us  including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data 
in addition  we may have disagreements with third party vendors and service providers regarding relative responsibilities for any such failures under applicable business associate agreements or other applicable outsourcing agreements 
any contractual remedies and or indemnification obligations we may have for vendor or service provider failures may not be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses suffered as a result of any vendor failure to satisfy its obligations to us or under applicable law 
our current and any future outsourcing arrangements could be adversely impacted by changes in the vendor or service provider operations  security posture or vulnerabilities  financial condition or other matters outside of our control 
if we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third party vendors and service providers  we could be subject to additional risk 
if these vendor and service provider relationships were terminated for any reason  we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms  may be required to pay a termination fee  which may be significant  and may incur significant costs and or disruption to our operations in connection with any such vendor or service provider transition 
as a result  we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and  in turn  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 
in addition  we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing projects or other relationships we enter into with third party vendors and service providers  as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing  unanticipated delays in transitioning our operations to the third party  vendor or service provider noncompliance with contract terms or violations of laws and or regulations  or otherwise 
this could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
violations of  or noncompliance with  laws and or regulations governing our business or noncompliance with contract terms by third party vendors and service providers could increase our exposure to liability to our members  providers or other third parties  or sanctions and or fines from the regulators that oversee our business 
in turn  this could increase the costs associated with the operation of our business or have an adverse impact on our business and reputation 
in addition  we currently outsource and may in the future outsource key services and functions to third parties  including companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions  which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states  including international economic and political conditions  and additional costs associated with complying with foreign laws and us laws applicable to operations in foreign jurisdictions  such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act of we face a wide range of risks  and our success depends on our ability to identify  prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk exposures 
as a large company operating in a complex and highly regulated industry  we encounter a variety of risks 
the risks we face include  among others  a range of regulatory  competitive  financial  operational  reputational  external and industry risks identified in this risk factors discussion 
the third party vendors and service providers to which we outsource key functions are required to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations and contractual requirements 
any violations of  or noncompliance with  laws and or regulations governing our business  or the terms of our contracts  by third party vendors or service providers could increase our enterprise risk exposure 
as we consider further outsourcing of key functions  this risk increases 
we continue to devote resources to further develop and integrate our enterprise wide risk management processes 
failure to identify  prioritize and appropriately manage or mitigate these risks could adversely affect our profitability  our ability to retain or grow business or adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships on competitive terms with the hospitals  provider groups and other providers that provide services to our members  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with hospitals  provider groups and other providers as a means to provide access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization and to monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions  including litigation  which could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers and members  disruption to provider access for current members or to support growth  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations and multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market our products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
the recent trend of consolidation of hospitals  provider groups and other providers may further enhance this risk  particularly if such consolidation involves any of the hospitals  providers or provider groups that we currently have under contract 
as the health care environment has evolved  we are continuing to develop strategic provider relationships to help position us for  among other things  the aca  the cci and other federal and state health care reforms  regulations and initiatives 
accordingly  our business strategy includes creating tailored network products and other customized customer solutions through  among other things  strategic provider relationships that help manage the cost of care 
for example  our product portfolios and services include offerings such as smartcare sm  excelcare sm and communitycare sm  which are recent collaborations with our provider partners 
through these types of arrangements  we offer tailored network product offerings served by more cost effective physician groups and hospitals 
membership in our tailored network products was approximately of total commercial risk membership as of december   compared with as of december  for additional information on our tailored network products and innovative provider relationships  see item business segment information western region operations segment managed health care operations 
continued membership growth in our tailored network products and continued development of strategic provider relationships are important parts of our business strategy 
in addition  we will need to develop a new provider network on satisfactory terms to support our proposed participation in the cci  including with respect to the provision of ltss benefits  a service that we have not previously provided 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives  that the products we design in collaboration with certain providers will be successful or developed within the time periods expected  or that the products that we offer will be preferable to similar products of our competitors 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully develop a new provider network for our potential cci activities on satisfactory terms and within the necessary timeframe  or at all 
for additional discussion of the risks associated with our potential participation in the cci  see we will not be able to participate in the duals demonstration portion of the california coordinated care initiative in los angeles county or san diego county unless a number of objectives and conditions are met and if we participate in the california coordinated care initiative in los angeles county and or san diego county  this business opportunity may prove to be unsuccessful for a number of reasons 
failure to successfully implement these strategic initiatives may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we contract with professional providers in california primarily through capitation fee arrangements 
generally  under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services  and in some cases  institutional services 
provider groups that enter into capitation fee arrangements generally contract with primary care physicians  specialists and other secondary providers to provide services 
in addition  we frequently delegate responsibility for certain functions such as claims payment or utilization management to these providers under a delegated hmo model 
the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group financial instability or failure to pay specialists or secondary providers for services rendered could be exacerbated by the current economic conditions  and could lead specialists or secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in california  for instance  although legal precedent to date has held that health plans are normally not liable for unpaid provider claims under these circumstances  there can be no assurance that the law will not change  or that we will not be found liable for unpaid provider claims in the future 
there can also be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with specialists or secondary providers  the failure of any of which could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
in addition  certain provisions of the aca  including for example  the risk adjustment program  may make our existing provider fee arrangements less successful in certain of our market segments 
the risk adjustment program defines a health plan average actuarial risk  subsequently determines such health plan risk adjustment payment allocation based on the collection of encounter data from providers 
this structure puts more heavily capitated health plans such as ours at a disadvantage because providers receiving fixed fees from health insurers do not have the same incentive to provide accurate and complete encounter data with respect to services rendered when compared to providers under fee for service arrangements 
this incentive problem is particularly acute under the delegated hmo model  which is prevalent in our california health plans 
under this model  third party intermediaries assume responsibility for certain utilization management and care coordination responsibilities  including the collection of encounter data 
as a result  we have been working with providers to enhance our traditional capitation arrangements to help better align our and our providers interests in capturing accurate and complete encounter data and determining an accurate average actuarial risk 
for additional detail on the risk adjustment program and how the aca and related proposals and initiatives are changing the health care landscape  see federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations  various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level  which could have an adverse impact on us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully agree with providers to implement these modifications 
failure to successfully implement this strategy may have an adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our dependence on capitated provider groups is substantial in our western region operations reportable segment 
approximately of our western region operations members were enrolled with capitated provider groups as of december  our use of tailored network products also places a greater emphasis on our relationships with certain capitated provider groups  as tailored network products restrict covered members access to certain physician groups 
if these capitated provider groups cannot provide comprehensive services to our members in tailored network products or encounter financial difficulties  it could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
in addition  the use of tailored network products could create an increased risk of out of network claims issues  which could result in higher medical costs to us 
the provider groups that we contract with are also required to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
the inability of a provider group to pass compliance audits or otherwise maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations may cause us to terminate a contract with a provider or assume responsibility for the noncompliant functions  such as claims payment or utilization management 
furthermore  violations of  or noncompliance with  applicable laws and or regulations or contract terms by providers who perform delegated functions for us could increase our exposure to liability to our members or sanctions and or fines from the regulators that oversee our business  among other things 
if we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of these delegated entities  we could be subject to additional risk 
for additional information  see we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
some providers that render services to our members and insureds who have coverage for out of network services  or who obtain out of network emergency services  are not contracted with our plans and insurance companies 
in certain cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and the plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider  rather  the plan obligation is to reimburse the provider based upon the terms of the member plan or as otherwise required by law 
the amount of provider reimbursement that a plan is obligated to pay in certain cases is established by a standard set forth in the plan that is not clearly translated into dollar terms  such as maximum allowable amount or usual  customary and reasonable 
however  in other instances such reimbursement requirements are defined by statute or regulation and such amounts may  in certain instances  be greater than those calculated according to the plan standards 
for example  the aca formula for calculating the minimum amount that a plan is required to reimburse a provider for out of network emergency services will likely result in increased reimbursements to providers for such services 
these statutory requirements related to provider reimbursements may increase our health care costs  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  providers who render out of network services may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the plan or balance bill our member 
regulatory authorities in various states may also challenge the manner in which we reimburse members for services performed by non contracted providers 
as a result of litigation or regulatory activity  we may have to pay providers additional amounts or reimburse members for their out of pocket payments 
the uncertainty about our financial obligations for such services and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of our original payments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
physicians and other professional providers  provider groups and hospitals that contract with us have in certain situations commenced litigation and or arbitration proceedings against us to recover amounts for which they allege we are liable  including amounts related to unpaid claims and amounts they allege to be underpayments due to them under their contracts with us 
we are currently a party to matters of this nature and could face additional claims or be subject to litigation and or arbitration proceedings in the future in connection with similar matters 
we believe that provider groups and hospitals have become increasingly sophisticated in their review of claim payments and contractual terms in an effort to maximize their payments from us and have increased their use of outside professionals  including accounting firms and attorneys  in these efforts 
these efforts and the litigation and arbitration that result from them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse economic conditions in the united states may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the us economy continues to experience slow economic growth with concerns about high unemployment rates  government debt  geopolitical issues and other factors continuing to negatively impact expectations 
these events could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
these market conditions expose us to a number of risks  including risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers 
in light of the substantial uncertainty surrounding the ultimate impact of the aca and related state health care reform proposals  how the implementation of these new requirements will affect these risks remains unclear 
if our customer base experiences cash flow problems or other financial difficulties  it could  in turn  adversely impact membership in our plans 
for example  our customers may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products  or may make changes in the mix of products purchased from us 
if our customers experience financial issues  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
further  our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business  and in order to compete effectively in our markets  we also must deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers and that are designed and priced properly and competitively 
prior to the effective date of the aca guaranteed issue requirement  the adverse economic conditions may also cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary  employee funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 
a significant decline in membership in our plans and the inability of current and or potential customers to pay their premiums as a result of unfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
in addition  a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other providers and  as a result  could adversely affect our contracted rates with such parties and increase our medical costs 
high unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs and the profitability of our operations 
if economic conditions continue to be difficult and unemployment rates continue to be high  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
largely as a result of the recent economic conditions and new members from california spd program  we saw an increase in our medi cal membership of approximately  members  or  in our medi cal membership may increase as a result of medicaid expansion and our potential participation in the cci 
however  the state of california has a recent history of budget deficits 
an extended economic downturn and continued government efforts to contain medical costs and health care related expenditures could continue to adversely affect state and federal budgets  including california  resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government funded health care coverage programs  including medicare and medi cal or reimbursements or payments in these programs that do not keep pace with our cost trends 
for additional discussion on budget issues at the federal level and the potential risks to our business  see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the proposed reductions in california medi cal provider reimbursement rates due to ab are currently expected to be applicable to payments negotiated after april  however  if rate cuts are implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and or received from the government  it could adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
this risk may be amplified as our medi cal membership may increase through  among other things  potential medicaid expansion in california and our proposed participation in the cci 
however  the impact of such cuts could be limited since they would need to be reconciled with minimum payment rates for primary care physicians dictated by the aca for and therefore  due to the uncertainty regarding the final implementation of ab  we cannot reasonably estimate whether there will be reductions in premiums and or related health care cost recoveries nor can we estimate the range of any such reductions that may result in connection with ab see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate or other changes to these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for additional information regarding proposals to reduce california medi cal provider reimbursement rates and other state and federal budgetary matters that may impact us 
in addition  continued state and federal budgetary pressures could cause new or higher levels of assessments or taxes for our commercial programs  such as surcharges on select fee for service and capitated medical claims or premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
moreover  any enrollment freeze or significant delay in reimbursement payment from government programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
for example  in the past  budget issues have led the state of california to delay certain of its monthly medicaid payments to us 
any such irregularity in the timing of these payments in future periods may adversely impact our operating cash flow from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of such payments 
if we fail to effectively maintain our information management systems  it could adversely affect our business 
our business depends significantly on effective and efficient information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information management systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have different information systems for our various businesses and these systems require the commitment of significant resources for continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and evolving industry and regulatory standards 
we have partnered with third parties to support our information technology systems and to help design  build  test  implement and maintain our information management systems 
our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity also requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems within our overall enterprise architecture 
we are in the process of reducing the number of systems that we operate 
any difficulty or unexpected delay associated with the transition to or from information systems  including in connection with the decommissioning of a system or the implementation of a new system  any inability or failure to properly maintain information management systems  any failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems  including to renew technology  maintain technology currency  keep pace with evolving industry standards or eliminate redundant or obsolete applications  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory or other legal or compliance problems  significant increases in administrative expenses and or other adverse consequences 
if for any reason there is a business continuity interruption resulting in loss of access to or availability of data  we may  among other things  not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and  in turn  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow could be adversely impacted 
in addition  we obtain significant portions of our systems related and other services and facilities  including our data center  from independent third parties and are considering expanding our outsourced information technology arrangements 
this makes our operations vulnerable to adverse effects if such third parties fail to perform adequately 
see we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
the department of health and human services mandated new standards in the electronic transmission of health care transactions  including claims  remittance  eligibility  claims status requests and related responses  and privacy and security standards  known as hipaa that became effective in while we have implemented the hipaa requirements to be able to exchange formats with our trading partners  the failure of our trading partners to implement the hipaa requirements in a compliant manner could result in additional costs and administrative burden to us and have other adverse effects 
furthermore  cms adopted a new coding set for diagnoses  commonly referred to as icd  which significantly expands the number of codes utilized 
the new icd coding set is currently required to be implemented by october we will be required to incur significant additional expenses to implement and support the new icd coding set 
if we have not adequately implemented hipaa and or do not adequately implement the requirements of the aca and icd within the time period required  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows would be adversely affected 
we also face challenges with respect to our implementation and support of the requirements of the aca 
because federal and state regulators are still in the process of determining the final rules and regulations relating to the implementation of the aca  there is substantial uncertainty with respect to these requirements  including  but not limited to requirements related to the state based and federally facilitated exchanges  the assessment and collection of the health insurer fee and the reinsurance  risk adjustment and risk corridors programs 
among other things  we will need to define and implement new billing and payment capabilities and support new requests from third parties and government agencies for data collection and reporting 
these additional demands will require us to make significant systems changes  including developing  investing in  configuring and installing new products and technology 
implementation of these requirements will require the expenditure of material resources and will require significant changes in many aspects of our business 
see federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues and the costs of operating our business and could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations and various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level  which could have an adverse impact on us for further information regarding the aca and the challenges we face in implementing its provisions 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to implement the systems changes or other modifications necessary to successfully meet the requirements of the aca 
if we do not successfully execute our strategic and operational objectives with respect to the aca within the time period expected  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we must comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates with hipaa 
the department of health and human services has regulations in place under hipaa relating to the privacy and security of protected health information phi 
these regulations  as amended  require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to  among other obligations comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  disclosure  storage  and transmission of phi  adopt rigorous internal policies and procedures to safeguard phi  and enter into specific written agreements with business associates that receive  use and or create phi on our behalf 
hipaa also established significant civil and criminal sanctions for violations 
these regulations expose us to liability for  among other things  violations of the regulations by our business associates  including the third party vendors involved in our outsourcing projects 
the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the hitech act of expanded hipaa requirements for security and privacy safeguards  including improved enforcement  additional limitations on use and disclosure of phi and additional potential penalties for violations  and imposed notice obligations in the event of a breach of unsecured phi 
the hitech act has been implemented on a rolling basis through subsequent rulemaking 
on january   the office of civil rights ocr of hhs issued the omnibus final rule on hipaa privacy  security  breach notification requirements and enforcement requirements under the hitech act  and a final regulation for required changes to the hipaa privacy rule for the genetic information nondiscrimination act 
the omnibus final rule becomes effective on march   with an applicable compliance date of september  although our contracts with our business associates provide for protections of phi by our business associates  we may have limited control over the actions and practices of our business associates 
compliance with hipaa and state and federal privacy and security laws and regulations has resulted in and may in the future result in significant costs to us due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by us or our business associates 
see also if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain the privacy and security of such information  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
the collection  maintenance  use  disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable health information or data  including phi  by our businesses are regulated at the federal and state levels  and in some cases are subject to contractual requirements 
despite the privacy and security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws  regulations and contractual requirements  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party vendors and service providers  are vulnerable to privacy and security incidents including  but not limited to  computer hacking  breaches  acts of vandalism or theft  computer viruses or other forms of cyber attack  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors or other similar events 
for example  in january  we were notified by a third party vendor that certain of our server drives could not be accounted for in connection with the migration of our data center to a facility owned and operated by our third party vendor 
we subsequently commenced an investigation of the contents of the unaccounted for server drives  including a detailed forensic review by computer experts  and determined that certain of these unaccounted for drives contain phi and other personally identifiable information relating to certain individuals 
we reported the loss to authorities and notified affected individuals 
this matter is under review by various regulatory authorities 
we are currently party to various putative class action lawsuits brought in federal and state courts on behalf of individuals who claim to be affected by this incident 
see item legal proceedings and we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  we incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity could be adversely affected if litigation expenses are greater than we project for additional information about these actions and the associated risks 
a party  whether internal or external  that is able to circumvent our security systems could  among other things  misappropriate or misuse sensitive or confidential information including but not limited to phi and other member information  user information or other proprietary information  cause significant interruptions in our operations and cause all or portions of our website to be unavailable 
internal or external parties may attempt to circumvent our security systems  and we have experienced external attacks on our network  such as  for example  reconnaissance probes and denial of service attempts 
we have expended significant resources to protect against such attacks in the past  and will continue to do so in the future 
any reductions in the availability of our website could impair our ability to conduct our business and adversely impact our members during the occurrence of any such incident 
because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently  often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world  we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures for all situations 
noncompliance with any privacy laws or data security laws or any security incident or breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information  whether by us  one of our business associates or another third party  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation  financial condition and results of operations  including but not limited to material fines and penalties  compensatory  special  punitive  and statutory damages  litigation  consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices  requirements that we provide notices  credit monitoring services and or credit restoration services or other relevant services to impacted individuals  adverse actions against our licenses to do business  and injunctive relief 
additionally  the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial 
we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness  or need to refinance existing indebtedness  in the future  which may adversely affect our operations 
our indebtedness includes million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due our senior notes payable balance was million as of december  in addition  we have a million five year revolving credit facility that expires in october as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
for a description of our senior notes and our revolving credit facility  see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
our existing indebtedness  and any additional debt we incur in the future through drawings on our revolving credit facility or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund stock repurchases  working capital  capital expenditures and other general operating requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
we continually evaluate options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
in the event we need to access the credit markets  including to refinance our debt  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
downgrades in our debt ratings may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims paying ability  financial strength  and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and managed care companies 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings also are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers 
in addition  our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and  accordingly  our cost of capital 
rating agencies review our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future 
our ratings reflect each rating agency independent opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders and other factors  and are subject to change 
potential downgrades from ratings agencies  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are a holding company and substantially all of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of minimum levels of capital 
as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt depends  in part  on the amount of cash that we receive from our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
under the california knox keene health care service plan act of  as amended  certain of our subsidiaries must comply with certain minimum capital or tangible net equity tne requirements 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries have agreed to certain undertakings to the department of managed health care  restricting dividends and loans to affiliates  to the extent that the payment of such would reduce its tne below the minimum requirement or of the minimum requirement  or reduce its cash to claims ratio below in addition  in certain states our regulated subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements  known as rbc 
these laws require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk based capital calculations to the departments of insurance in their state of domicile and the national association of insurance commissioners 
failure to maintain the minimum rbc standards could subject certain of our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action  including increased reporting and or state supervision 
in addition  in most states  we are required to seek prior approval before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying us dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to us  it could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and free cash flow 
for additional information regarding our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital requirements  see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources statutory capital requirements 
acquisitions  divestitures and other significant transactions may adversely affect our business 
we continue to evaluate the profitability realized or that we expect to be realized by our existing businesses and operations 
from time to time we review  from a strategic standpoint  potential acquisitions and divestitures in light of our core businesses and growth strategies 
the success of any such acquisition or divestiture depends  in part  upon our ability to identify suitable buyers or sellers  negotiate favorable contractual terms and  in many cases  obtain governmental approval 
for acquisitions  success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations 
for divestitures  success may also be dependent upon efficiently reducing general and administrative or other functions for our remaining operations 
in the event the structure of the transaction results in continuing obligations by the buyer to us or our customers  a buyer inability to fulfill these obligations could lead to future financial loss on our part 
as a seller  we may have significant continuing indemnification  administrative services or other obligations to the buyer 
potential acquisitions or divestitures present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including diversion of management attention from existing businesses  difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems  significant post closing obligations  increased expenses  assumption of unknown liabilities  indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers 
on april   our subsidiary health net life insurance company hnl sold substantially all of the assets  properties and rights of hnl used primarily or exclusively in our medicare stand alone prescription drug plan medicare pdp business to cvs caremark and cvs caremark assumed certain related liabilities and obligations of hnl as set forth in the related asset purchase agreement 
we recognized a million pretax gain on the sale  or million net of tax 
we are subject to certain post closing obligations in connection with the sale  including a prohibition against offering stand alone medicare pdp plans for one year following the closing  subject to certain exceptions 
in addition  we provide medicare pdp transition related services to cvs caremark in connection with the transaction 
we have completed the majority of these services  but certain transition related services are being provided in among the other risks discussed above  if we are unable to reduce our general and administrative or other functions for our remaining operations  it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
the value of our intangible assets may become impaired 
goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately million as of december   representing approximately percent of our total assets and percent of our consolidated stockholders equity at december  in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired  in which case a charge to income may be necessary 
this impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding estimated fair value including assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and membership levels based on current and future plans and initiatives  long term strategies and our annual planning and forecasting processes  as well as the expected weighted average cost of capital used in the discount process 
if estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets  we may be required to record impairment losses against income 
any future evaluations resulting in an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially impact our results of operations and stockholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in stockholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
from time to time  we divest businesses that we believe are less of a strategic fit for the company or do not produce an adequate return 
any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment charges  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates goodwill and other intangible assets for further discussion of our procedures related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the value of our investment portfolio and our goodwill could be adversely impacted by varying economic and market conditions which could  in turn  have a negative effect on our results of operations and stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of available for sale investment securities such as interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities 
as of december   our available for sale investment securities were approximately billion 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease 
these securities may also be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
we closely monitor the fair values of our investment securities and regularly evaluate them for any other than temporary impairments 
we have the intent and ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amount invested 
the current economic environment and uncertainty in the us and global capital markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments  such as the debt securities we hold  and a worsening in these markets could have additional negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets 
in addition  such uncertainty has increased the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets 
over time  the economic and capital market environment may further decline or provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities  which could change our judgment regarding the impairment of certain investments 
this could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines being charged against future income 
there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and material other than temporary impairments may result in realized losses in future periods  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our investment portfolio 
in addition  our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to state laws and regulations that govern the types of investments that are allowable and admissible in those subsidiaries portfolios 
there can be no assurance that our investment assets will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  illiquidity or otherwise  could have a negative effect on our stockholders equity 
in addition  if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if our stock price experiences significant fluctuations or if our market capitalization materially declines  we could be required to take an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill 
if we were required to take such a charge  it would be non cash and would not affect our liquidity or financial condition  but could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge was taken 
our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our million revolving credit facility due in october requires us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in other activities 
our revolving credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure revolving credit facility for further details regarding our revolving credit facility 
the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and  in some circumstances  under the indenture governing our senior notes  which  in any case  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to volatility 
in  the morgan stanley healthcare payor index the hmo index  an index comprised of managed care organizations  including health net  recorded an approximate increase in its value  while the per share value of our common stock decreased by 
there can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will vary in a manner consistent with the variation in the hmo index or the standard poor mid cap index of which our common stock is also a component 
the market prices of our common stock and the securities of certain other publicly traded companies in our industry have shown significant volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors  including the aca and health care reform generally  public communications regarding managed care  legislative or regulatory actions  litigation or threatened litigation  health care cost trends  proposed premium increases  pricing trends  competition  earnings  proposed changes in government programs  receivable collections or membership reports of particular industry participants  and market speculation about or actual merger and acquisition activity 
additionally  adverse developments affecting any one of the companies in our sector could cause the price of our common stock to weaken  even if those adverse developments do not otherwise affect us 
there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time or the impact of these or any other factors on our stock price 
securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
if we were to become involved in securities litigation  it could subject us to substantial costs  divert resources and the attention of management from our business  and otherwise adversely affect our business 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and services 
managed health care companies have received and continue to receive negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry 
for example  the company and the managed health care industry have been subject to negative publicity surrounding premium rate increases government investigations into the industry and our own business practices 
in addition  health care and related health care reform and proposals have been and are expected to continue to be the subject of intense media attention and political debate 
such political discourse can often generate publicity that portrays managed care in a negative light 
these risks will be exacerbated in the event we and other companies in our industry raise premium rates by more than has been done in recent years to price for the expanded benefits required by  and the fees  taxes and assessments imposed by  the aca or to respond to any increase in medical cost trends 
our marketing efforts may be affected by the amount of negative publicity to which the industry has been subject  as well as by speculation and uncertainty relating to merger and acquisition activity among companies in our industry 
speculation  uncertainty or negative publicity about us  our industry or our lines of business could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products or services  require changes to our products or services  or stimulate additional legislation  regulation  review of industry practices or litigation that could adversely affect us 
managing executive succession and retention is critical to our success 
if we are unable to manage the succession of our key executives  it could adversely affect our business 
we are dependent on retaining existing key executives and attracting additional qualified executives to meet current and future needs 
we face intense competition for qualified executives  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such executives 
although we have succession plans in place and have employment arrangements with our key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of these key executives will continue to be available to us or that we will be able to attract and retain suitable successors 
we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for future turnover of our senior management team 
we depend  in part  on independent brokers and sales agents to market our products and services  and recent regulatory investigations have focused on certain brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements and bid quoting practices 
we market our products and services both through sales people employed by us and through independent sales agents 
independent sales agents typically do not work with us on an exclusive basis and may market health care products and services of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent sales agents and we cannot assure you that these agents will continue to market our products at a reasonable cost 
although we have a number of sales employees and agents  if key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals were to leave us  our ability to retain existing customers and members could be impaired 
the aca includes broker and agent commissions as administrative expenses for purposes of calculating the minimum medical loss ratio 
as a result  these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other administrative costs of health insurers  and there is pressure to make changes to existing commission structures for brokers and agents 
for example  some of our competitors have reduced the commissions payable to brokers and agents for sales in the individual market  and we have implemented similar reductions in the individual market in california 
in addition  the implementation of certain provisions of the aca  including the exchanges  will open new distribution channels to customers or reduce or otherwise modify the roles that brokers play in our marketing and sales practices 
our relationships with brokers and agents could be adversely impacted by changes in our business practices to address these pressures and changing roles  including potential reductions in commissions and changes in the treatment of consulting fees 
there have been a number of investigations and enforcement actions against insurance brokers and insurers over the last several years regarding allegedly inappropriate or undisclosed payments made by insurers to brokers for the placement of insurance business 
we could be sanctioned as a result of unlawful acts by our agents or brokers 
in addition  investigations by state attorneys general  cms and other regulators  as well as regulatory changes initiated in several states in response to allegedly inappropriate broker conduct and broker payment practices  could result in changes in industry practices or negative publicity that could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products 
we are dependent on our ability to recruit  manage  enable and retain a large workforce 
our products and services and our operations require a large number of employees 
as of december   we employed  individuals on a full time basis and individuals on a part time or temporary basis 
it is critical that we recruit  manage  enable and retain talent to successfully execute our strategic objectives  which requires aligned policies  a positive work environment and a robust succession and talent development process 
further  particularly in light of the changing health care environment  we must focus on building employee capabilities to help ensure that we can meet upcoming challenges and opportunities 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit  manage  enable and retain talent and meet upcoming challenges and opportunities 
in addition  the impact of the external or internal environment or other factors on employee morale  enablement and engagement could also significantly impact the success of the company 
our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties 
our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward looking statements 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and  as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this report  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the uncertainties associated with federal and state health care reform  challenging economic conditions and our potential participation in new government programs or the provision of new services and or benefits to new populations  among other things  may make it particularly difficult to forecast our future performance 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will meet any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire mix of publicly available historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us  our services  and our industry when evaluating our forecasts and other forward looking statements relating to our operations and financial performance 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  which could decrease the value of your shares of our common stock 
we are subject to the delaware anti takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us 
in addition  federal antitrust laws apply to us  and any change in control of our state health plans or health insurance companies also would require the approvals of the applicable regulatory agencies in each state in which we operate 
in addition to the rights agreement  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of the company that our stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an outbreak of a pandemic disease and or future terrorist activities  including bio terrorism  could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
depending on the government actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  a large scale public health epidemic or future acts of bio terrorism could lead to  among other things  increased utilization of health care services and the associated increased health care costs due to increased in patient and out patient hospital costs  disruption of information and payment systems and the cost of any anti viral medication used to treat affected people 
disasters  including earthquakes  fires and floods  could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations and result in an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
disasters such as fires  floods  earthquakes  tornados  power losses  virus outbreaks  telecommunications failures  break ins or similar events could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations  result in loss of data  and or delay or impair our ability to service our members and providers 
we have in place a disaster recovery plan that is intended to provide us with the ability to recover our critical information technology systems in the event of a natural disaster utilizing various alternate sites provided by a national disaster recovery vendor 
however  there can be no assurance that such adverse effects will not occur in the event of a disaster 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under the agreements that govern the northeast sale  we have retained responsibility for certain liabilities of the acquired business  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under the stock purchase agreement for the northeast sale  we are required to indemnify the buyer and its affiliates for all pre closing liabilities of the acquired business and for a broad range of excluded liabilities  including liabilities arising out of the acquired business incurred through the winding up and running out period of the acquired business 
the stock purchase agreement does not limit the amount or duration of our obligations to the buyer and its affiliates with respect to these indemnities 
as a result  in the event that the amount of these liabilities was to exceed our expectations  we could be responsible to the buyer and its affiliates for substantial indemnification obligations  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
at the closing of the northeast sale  we entered into a non competition agreement with the buyer that contains prohibitions which could negatively impact our prospects  business  financial condition or results of operations 
under the stock purchase agreement  at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the agreement  we entered into a non competition agreement with the buyer  pursuant to which we generally are prohibited from competing with the acquired business in the states of new york  new jersey  connecticut and rhode island for a period of five years from the closing  and from engaging in certain other restricted activities 
although we currently do not have any intention to engage in such prohibited activities during the term of the non competition agreement  circumstances could change and it may become in our best interests to engage in a business that is prohibited by the agreement 
if this were to occur  in order to engage in the business we would be required to obtain the buyer consent under the non competition agreement  which the buyer could withhold in its discretion 
in the event that we are unable to engage in a business due to the terms of the non competition agreement  this could have an adverse effect on our prospects  business  financial condition or results of operations 
we also face other risks that could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  which include any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles  a significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting  our inability to convert to international financial reporting standards  if required  failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies  including data security  provider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self insured customers  failure to protect our proprietary information  and failure of our corporate governance policies or procedures

item legal proceedings 
overview we record reserves and accrue costs for certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters to the extent that we determine an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
while such reserves and accrued costs reflect our best estimate of the probable loss for such matters  our recorded amounts may differ materially from the actual amount of any such losses 
in some cases  no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued  if any  can be made because of the inherently unpredictable nature of legal and regulatory proceedings  which may be exacerbated by various factors  including but not limited to that they may involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines  penalties or punitive damages  present novel legal theories or legal uncertainties  involve disputed facts  represent a shift in regulatory policy  involve a large number of parties  claimants or regulatory bodies  are in the early stages of the proceedings  involve a number of separate proceedings  each with a wide range of potential outcomes  or result in a change of business practices 
further  there may be various levels of judicial review available to the company in connection with any such proceeding in the event damages are awarded or a fine or penalty is assessed 
as of the date of this report  amounts accrued for legal proceedings and regulatory matters were not material 
however  it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of or development in legal and or regulatory proceedings  including those described below in this item under the heading litigation and investigations related to unaccounted for server drives  depending  in part  upon our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow or liquidity in such period  and our reputation may be adversely affected 
except for the regulatory and legal proceedings discussed in this item under the heading litigation and investigations related to unaccounted for server drives  management believes that the ultimate outcome of any of the regulatory and legal proceedings that are currently pending against us should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
litigation and investigations related to unaccounted for server drives we are a defendant in three related litigation matters pending in california state and federal courts relating to information security issues 
on january   international business machines corp 
ibm  which handles our data center operations  notified us that it could not locate several hard disk drives that had been used in our data center located in rancho cordova  california 
we have since determined that personal information of approximately two million former and current health net members  employees and health care providers is on the drives 
commencing on march   we provided written notification to the individuals whose information is on the drives 
to help protect the personal information of affected individuals  we offered them two years of free credit monitoring services  in addition to identity theft insurance and fraud resolution and restoration of credit files services  if needed 
on march   a putative class action relating to this incident was filed against us in the us district court for the central district of california the central district of california  and similar actions were later filed against us in other federal and state courts in california 
a number of those actions were transferred to and consolidated in the us district court for the eastern district of california the eastern district of california  and the two remaining actions are currently pending in the superior court of california  county of san francisco san francisco county superior court and the superior court of california  county of sacramento sacramento county superior court 
the consolidated amended complaint in the federal action pending in the eastern district of california was filed on behalf of a putative class of over  of our current or former members who received the written notification  and also named ibm as a defendant 
it sought to state claims for violation of the california confidentiality of medical information act and the california customer records act  and sought statutory damages of up to  for each class member  as well as injunctive and declaratory relief  attorneys fees and other relief 
on january   the district court issued an order dismissing the consolidated complaint on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their action in federal court 
on april   an amended complaint with a new plaintiff was filed against us  but no longer asserted claims against ibm 
the amended complaint asserted the same causes of action and sought the same relief as the earlier complaint 
on june   we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint  which is currently pending 
the san francisco county superior court proceeding was instituted on march  and is brought on behalf of a putative class of california residents who received the written notification  and seeks to state similar claims against us  as well as claims for violation of california unfair competition law  and seeks similar relief 
we moved to compel arbitration of the two named plaintiffs claims 
the court granted our motion as to one of the named plaintiffs and denied it as to the other 
we are appealing the latter ruling 
thereafter  the plaintiff as to whom our motion to compel arbitration was granted filed a petition for a writ of mandate with the california court of appeal seeking review of that ruling 
on july   the court of appeal issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order granting the motion to compel arbitration and to enter an order denying the motion to compel 
the sacramento county superior court proceeding was instituted on april  and is brought on behalf of a putative class of california members whose information was contained on the unaccounted for drives 
the action contains the same claims and seeks the same relief as the case pending in the eastern district of california 
on june   we filed a demurrer seeking dismissal of this complaint  which is currently pending 
we have also been informed that a number of regulatory agencies are investigating the incident  including the california department of managed health care dmhc  the california department of insurance  the california attorney general  the massachusetts office of consumer affairs and business regulation and the office of civil rights of the us department of health and human services 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims  however  these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties 
miscellaneous proceedings in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are subject to periodic reviews  investigations and audits by various federal and state regulatory agencies  including  without limitation  cms  dmhc  the office of civil rights of the us department of health and human services and state departments of insurance  with respect to our compliance with a wide variety of rules and regulations applicable to our business  including  without limitation  hipaa  rules relating to pre authorization penalties  payment of out of network claims  timely review of grievances and appeals  and timely and accurate payment of claims  any one of which may result in remediation of certain claims  contract termination  the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs  and the assessment of regulatory fines or penalties  which could be substantial 
from time to time  we receive subpoenas and other requests for information from  and are subject to investigations by  such regulatory agencies  as well as from state attorneys general 
there also continues to be heightened review by regulatory authorities of  and increased litigation regarding  the health care industry business practices  including  without limitation  information privacy  premium rate increases  utilization management  appeal and grievance processing  rescission of insurance coverage and claims payment practices 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are party to various other legal proceedings  including  without limitation  litigation arising out of our general business activities  such as contract disputes  employment litigation  wage and hour claims  including  without limitation  cases involving allegations of misclassification of employees and or failure to pay for off the clock work  real estate and intellectual property claims  claims brought by members or providers seeking coverage or additional reimbursement for services allegedly rendered to our members  but which allegedly were denied  underpaid  not timely paid or not paid  and claims arising out of the acquisition or divestiture of various business units or other assets 
we are also subject to claims relating to the performance of contractual obligations to providers  members  employer groups and others  including the alleged failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the manner in which we process claims  and claims alleging that we have engaged in unfair business practices 
in addition  we are subject to claims relating to information security incidents and breaches  reinsurance agreements  rescission of coverage and other types of insurance coverage obligations and claims relating to the insurance industry in general 
we are  and may be in the future  subject to class action lawsuits brought against various managed care organizations and other class action lawsuits 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the miscellaneous legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently a party  however  these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are being sought 
potential settlements we regularly evaluate legal proceedings and regulatory matters pending against us  including those described above in this item  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the costs associated with any settlement of the various legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may be subject from time to time  including those described above in this item  could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in a significant earnings charge or impact on our cash flow in any particular quarter in which we enter into a settlement agreement and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity and may affect our reputation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview general we are a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers managed health care services through health plans and government sponsored managed care plans 
our mission is to help people be healthy  secure and comfortable 
we provide and administer health benefits to approximately million individuals across the country through group  individual  medicare including the medicare prescription drug benefit commonly referred to as part d  medicaid  us department of defense department of defense or dod  including tricare  and veterans affairs programs 
through our subsidiaries  we also offer behavioral health  substance abuse and employee assistance programs  managed health care products related to prescription drugs  managed health care product coordination for multi region employers  and administrative services for medical groups and self funded benefits programs 
how we report our results we operate within three reportable segments  western region operations  government contracts and divested operations and services  each of which is described below 
our health plan services are provided under our western region operations reportable segment  which includes the operations primarily conducted in california  arizona  oregon and washington for our commercial  medicare and medicaid health plans  our health and life insurance companies  our pharmaceutical services subsidiaries and certain operations of our behavioral health subsidiaries in several states including arizona  california and oregon 
we have approximately million medical members in our western region operations reportable segment 
on april   we completed the sale of our medicare stand alone prescription drug plan business medicare pdp business to pennsylvania life insurance company  a subsidiary of cvs caremark corporation cvs caremark 
as a result  the operating results related to our medicare pdp business have been excluded from continuing operations results and are classified in this annual report on form k as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and accordingly  the information included in this annual report on form k regarding our western region operations reportable segment excludes the operating results of our medicare pdp business for the years ended december   and for additional information regarding the sale of our medicare pdp business  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our government contracts segment includes our government sponsored managed care contract with the dod under the tricare program in the north region and other health care related government contracts 
on april   we began delivery of administrative services under a new managed care support contract t contract for the tricare north region 
under the t contract for the tricare north region  we provide administrative services to approximately million military health system mhs eligible beneficiaries 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading government contracts for additional information on the t contract

as a result of entering into a definitive agreement in january to sell our medicare pdp business  we reviewed our reportable segments in the first quarter of following this review  all services provided in connection with divested businesses  including those relating to the sale of our medicare pdp business and the northeast sale as defined below  were reported as part of our divested operations and services reportable segment beginning in the first quarter of prior period segment information has been conformed to this current presentation in this annual report on form k

see note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading divested operations and services and notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments  the northeast sale and the sale of our medicare pdp business 
how we measure our profitability our profitability depends in large part on our ability to  among other things  effectively price our health care products  manage health care and pharmacy costs  contract with health care providers  attract and retain members  and manage our general and administrative g a and selling expenses 
in addition  factors such as state and federal health care reform legislation and regulation  competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability 
the effect of escalating health care costs  as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers  may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business 
each of these factors may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we measure our western region operations reportable segment profitability based on medical care ratio mcr and pretax income 
the mcr is calculated as health plan services expense divided by health plan services premiums 
the pretax income is calculated as health plan services premiums and administrative services fees and other income less health plan services expense and g a and other net expenses 
see results of operations western region operations reportable segment western region operations segment results for a calculation of mcr and pretax income 
health plan services premiums generally include health maintenance organization hmo  point of service pos and preferred provider organization ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
medicare revenue can also include amounts for risk factor adjustments and additional premiums that we charge in some places to members who purchase our medicare risk plans 
the amount of premiums we earn in a given period is driven by the rates we charge and enrollment levels 
administrative services fees and other income primarily includes revenue for administrative services such as claims processing  customer service  medical management  provider network access and other administrative services 
health plan services expense generally includes medical and related costs for health services provided to our members  including physician services  hospital and related professional services  outpatient care  and pharmacy benefit costs 
these expenses are impacted by unit costs and utilization rates 
unit costs represent the health care cost per visit  and the utilization rates represent the volume of health care consumption by our members 
g a expenses include those costs related to employees and benefits  consulting and professional fees  marketing  business expansion initiatives  premium taxes and assessments  occupancy costs and litigation and regulatory related costs 
such costs are driven by membership levels  introduction of new products or provision of new services  system consolidations  outsourcing activities and compliance requirements for changing regulations  among other things 
these expenses also include expenses associated with corporate shared services and other costs to reflect the fact that such expenses are incurred primarily to support health plan services 
selling expenses consist of external broker commission expenses and generally vary with premium volume 
we measure our government contracts segment profitability based on pretax income  which is calculated as government contracts revenue less government contracts cost 
see results of operations government contracts reportable segment government contracts segment results for a calculation of the government contracts pretax income 
under the t contract for the tricare north region  we provide various types of administrative services including provider network management  referral management  medical management  disease management  enrollment  customer service  clinical support service  and claims processing 
we also provide assistance in the transition activities related to both the t contract and the prior tricare north region contract 
these services are structured as cost reimbursement arrangements for health care costs plus administrative fees earned in the form of fixed prices  fixed unit prices  and contingent fees and payments based on various incentives and penalties 
we recognize revenue related to administrative services on a straight line basis over the option period  when the fees become fixed and determinable 
the tricare north region members are served by our network and out of network providers in accordance with the t contract 
we pay health care costs related to these services to the providers and are later reimbursed by the dod for such payments 
under the terms of the t contract  we are not the primary obligor for health care services and accordingly  we do not include health care costs and related reimbursements in our consolidated statements of operations 
the t contract also includes various performance based incentives and penalties 
for each of the incentives or penalties  we adjust revenue accordingly based on the amount that we have earned or incurred at each interim date and are legally entitled to in the event of a contract termination 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading government contracts for additional information on our t contract 
under our previous tricare contract for the north region  government contracts revenue was made up of two major components health care and administrative services 
the health care component included revenue recorded for health care costs for the provision of services to our members  including paid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims ibnr expenses for which we were at risk  and underwriting fees earned for providing health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
the administrative services component encompassed fees received for all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contract with the government 
government contracts revenue and expenses included the impact from underruns and overruns relative to our target cost under the applicable contracts 
we measure our divested operations and services segment profitability based on pretax income 
this pretax income is calculated as divested operations and services segment total revenues less divested operations and services segment total expenses 
see results of operations divested operations and services reportable segment results for a calculation of our divested operations and services pretax income 
health care reform legislation during the first quarter of  president obama signed into law both the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the aca  which is causing and will continue to cause significant changes to the us health care system and alter the dynamics of the health care insurance industry 
the legislation includes provisions  which  among other things will impose a significant non deductible tax technically taking the form of a fee on health insurers  effective for calendar years beginning after december  this health insurer fee will be assessed at a total of billion in  will increase thereafter and will be allocated pro rata amongst industry participants based on net premiums written  subject to certain exceptions 
payment of the health insurer fee will not be due until  however  it has started to impact us since our premium rates are set a year in advance  and the tax amounts for depend on net premiums written in additionally  regulations relating to the health insurer fee have not yet been issued by the internal revenue service irs  making related payment procedures  timing and financial reporting requirements unclear 
if we are not able to incorporate the costs of our pro rata portion of the health insurer fee when we set our premium rates  or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business to address this additional new cost  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  some of our competitors may have greater economies of scale  which  among other things  may lead to lower expense ratios and higher profit margins than we have 
since the health insurer fee is not tax deductible  it will generally represent a higher percentage of our profits  and therefore could impact us to a greater degree than these larger competitors 
moreover  some of our competitors  including  among others  government entities  certain non profits insurers and self funded plans  may not be required to pay the health insurer fee or may be required to pay only one half the rate we will be required to pay  which may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete effectively 
we may not be able to match our competitors ability to support reduced premiums by virtue of any full or partial exemptions from the fees and taxes imposed by the aca  or by making changes to their distribution arrangements  decreasing spending on non medical product features and services  or otherwise adjusting their operating costs and reducing general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the aca requires the establishment of state based or federally facilitated exchanges where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage 
california  oregon and washington  among others  have passed legislation that will make coverage by health plans on their respective exchanges effective in participation in these and other exchanges in the states in which we operate may be conditioned on the approval of the applicable state or federal government regulator 
in some cases  the factors to be considered for inclusion on the exchanges have not yet been finalized or may be subject to change  which could result in the exclusion of some carriers from the exchanges 
in addition  states and the federal government are continuing to finalize other rules and regulations related to the actual operation of the exchanges  including  without limitation  with respect to state and federal rate review for plans offered on the exchanges  federal subsidies for premiums  cost sharing reductions  mandated state essential health benefits  the operation of reinsurance  risk corridors and risk adjustment mechanisms and the ability of participating insurers to continue to offer coverage to individuals and small group employers outside the exchanges 
we have submitted bids to participate in certain exchanges  and intend to submit future bids in certain eligible counties  but due in part to the uncertainty and complexity of the regulatory environment surrounding the implementation of the exchanges  including  among other things  with respect to the required level of essential health benefits that must be provided by participants in the exchanges  there is no assurance that our bids or any participation in exchanges will be successful 
the developing regulatory structure for the exchanges will shape the marketplace for individual and small group health plans both within and outside the exchanges  and these changes will require us to modify our strategies and operations in response 
for example  we will need to adjust our product offerings and marketing and sales practices  including through the development of new tools  to adapt to the new direct to consumer distribution channels that will be introduced in the exchanges 
in response to these changes in the health care market  our competitors could modify their product features or benefits  change their pricing relative to others in the market and adjust their mix of business within or outside the exchanges  or even exit segments of the market 
new competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may also introduce product offerings or pricing that we may not be able to match  which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
see item a 
risk factors the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline for additional discussion on the risks related to the changing competitive landscape 
if we fail to effectively adapt our business strategy and operations to these evolving markets  including with respect to shifts in consumer interface  product offerings and the competitive landscape  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the aca also contains risk adjustment provisions applicable to the individual and small group markets that take effect in these risk adjustment provisions will effectively transfer funds from health plans with relatively lower risk enrollees to plans with relatively higher risk enrollees to help protect against adverse selection 
the individual and small group markets represent a significant portion of our commercial business and the relevant amounts transferred may be substantial 
effectively adapting to these risk adjustment provisions may require us to modify our operational and strategic initiatives to focus on and manage different populations of potential members than we have in the past 
in addition  the risk adjustment mechanism relies on encounter data to define a health plan average actuarial risk 
the process of collecting this data presents disadvantages to more heavily capitated health plans such as ours because providers receiving fixed fees from health insurers do not have the same incentive to provide accurate and complete encounter data with respect to services rendered when compared to providers under fee for service arrangements 
this incentive problem is particularly acute for health plans operating under the delegated hmo model  which is prevalent in our california health plans 
under this model  third party intermediaries assume responsibility for certain utilization management and care coordination responsibilities  including the collection of encounter data 
if we are not able to successfully design and implement operational and strategic initiatives to adapt to these changes in certain of our markets  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
for a further discussion regarding the aca and related legislation  including a description of certain of its key provisions and the proposed timetable for their implementation  see item business government regulation health care reform legislation implementation of the provisions of the aca generally varies from as early as enactment to as late as in addition to the health insurer fee  the establishment of the exchanges and the risk adjustment provisions described above  some other potentially significant provisions of the aca will not become effective until or later  including  but not limited to  the excise tax on high premium insurance policies  increased taxes on medical device manufacturers  increased fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers  the guaranteed issue requirement and the individual mandate 
however  some of these provisions will have an earlier impact on our operations  including in connection with the setting of our premium rates as discussed above 
various aspects of the aca will transform the operating and regulatory landscape in the markets in which we operate  and could have an adverse impact on the cost of operating our business  and our revenues  enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments 
for example  among other things  the aca will require premium rate review in certain market segments and will require that premium rebates be paid to policyholders in the event certain specified minimum medical loss ratios are not met 
we do not believe that we will be required to pay a material amount in rebates with respect to our business  however  we cannot be certain that we will not be required to pay material amounts in rebates in the future 
in addition  as part of the rate review process  certain insurers may be excluded from participating in the exchanges if the review determines that the insurer has demonstrated a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium rate increases 
the aca may also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain members  and will increase the amount of certain taxes and fees we pay  the latter of which is expected to increase our effective tax rate in future periods 
as noted above with respect to the health insurer fee  we are unable to estimate the amount of these fees and taxes or the increase in our effective tax rate because material information and guidance regarding the calculations of these fees and taxes has not been issued 
the sales tax on medical device manufacturers and increase in the amount of fees pharmaceutical manufacturers pay imposed by the aca  could  in turn  also increase our medical costs 
further  it is not yet clear how state regulators will respond to rate filings that include requests to increase premiums to cover increased costs resulting from the health insurer fee or any other portion of the aca  particularly in light of recent heightened regulatory scrutiny of premium rates 
in the event regulators take positions preventing or delaying health insurers from increasing premiums to reflect aca related costs  or if consumers forego coverage as a result of such premium increases  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
see item a 
risk factors we face competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices 
if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover our costs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations for further information on how these increased costs and our related ability to increase premium prices could affect our profitability 
we also face additional competition as new competitors enter the marketplace and existing competitors seize on opportunities to expand their business as a result of the aca  including as discussed above with respect to the exchanges 
for example  among other things  aca provisions related to accountable care organizations  or acos  which are intended to create incentives for health care participants to work together to treat an individual across different care settings  may create opportunities for provider organizations to compete with us by assuming care management and other administrative responsibilities as part of a more integrated delivery system 
however  there remains considerable uncertainty about the impact of the aca on the health insurance market as a whole and what actions our competitors or potential competitors could take in response to the legislation 
for additional information  see item a 
risk factors the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
because of the magnitude  scope and complexity of the aca  we also need to dedicate substantial resources and incur material expenses to implement the legislation 
any delay or failure by us to execute our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to health care reform or otherwise appropriately react to the legislation  implementing regulations and actions of our competitors could result in operational disruptions  disputes with our providers or members  increased exposure to litigation  regulatory issues  damage to our existing or potential member relationships or other adverse consequences 
there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the aca  including with respect to clarifying regulations and other guidance that have yet to be issued or are subject to revision  potential legal and legislative challenges  changes in the competitive health care landscape resulting from the aca as well as various state reform proposals and initiatives that in some cases enact benefit mandates that go beyond the provisions in the aca 
any amendment or withholding of aca funding by congress  extended delays in the issuance of clarifying regulations and other guidance or other lingering uncertainty regarding the aca could cause us to incur additional costs of compliance or require us to significantly modify or adjust certain of the operational and strategic initiatives we have already established 
such modifications may result in the loss of some or all of the substantial resources that have been and will be invested in the aca implementation  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock 
various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level 
many of the states in which we operate are already implementing parts of the aca and many states have added new requirements that are more exacting than the aca requirements 
states may also mandate minimum medical loss ratios  implement rate reforms and enact benefit mandates that go beyond provisions included in the aca 
for example  while recently proposed california legislation requiring prior approval of premium rates by the california department of insurance the cdoi did not pass  an initiative measure in california to require prior approval for individual and small group rates by the cdoi has qualified for the ballot 
in addition  oversight boards associated with the state based exchanges in california  oregon and washington will negotiate the price of coverage sold on these exchanges 
these kinds of state regulations and legislation could limit or delay our ability to increase premiums even where actuarially supported and thereby could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
this also could increase the competition we face from companies that have lower health care or administrative costs than we do and therefore can price their premiums at lower levels than we can

risk factors the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
further  the interaction of new federal regulations and the implementation efforts of the various states in which we do business will continue to create substantial uncertainty for us and other health insurance companies about the requirements under which we must operate 
even in cases where state action is limited to implementing federal reforms  new or amended state laws will be required in many cases  and we will be required to operate under and comply with the various laws of each of the states in which we operate 
states may disagree in their interpretations of the federal statute and regulations  and state guidance that is issued could be unclear or untimely 
in the case of the aca exchanges  we will be required to operate under and comply with the regulatory authority of the federal government in addition to the regimes of each of the states that establish and administer their own exchanges 
for example  while california  oregon and washington have passed legislation establishing their own state run exchanges  arizona has declared that it will not create a state run exchange and instead will rely on a federally facilitated exchange 
if we do not successfully implement the various state law requirements of the aca  including with respect to the exchanges  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
due to the unsettled nature of the aca  its complexity  and the numerous steps required to implement it  we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of future regulations and laws  including state laws  implementing the aca 
depending in part on its ultimate requirements  the aca could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

recent developments on november   our wholly owned subsidiaries  health net of california  inc and health net community solutions  inc  entered into a settlement agreement agreement with the state of california department of health care services dhcs to settle historical rate disputes with respect to our participation in the state medicaid program in california medi cal  for rate years prior to the rate year 
as part of the agreement  dhcs has agreed  among other things  to an extension of all of our medi cal managed care contracts existing on the date of the agreement for an additional five years from their existing expiration dates  a settlement account applicable to all of our state sponsored health care programs  including medi cal  healthy families  seniors and persons with disabilities spds  the duals demonstrations that are expected to begin in and any potential future medicaid expansion under federal health care reform our state sponsored health care programs  as discussed in more detail below  compensate us should dhcs terminate any of our state sponsored health care programs contracts early  and cooperate in good faith to develop an alternative rate dispute resolution process 
effective january   the settlement account account was established with an initial balance of zero 
the balance in the account will be adjusted annually to reflect a calendar year deficit or surplus 
a deficit or surplus will result to the extent our actual pre tax margin as defined in the agreement on our state sponsored health care programs is below or above a pre determined pre tax margin target 
cash settlement of the account will occur on december   except that under certain circumstances the dhcs may extend the final settlement for up to three additional one year periods as may be extended  the term 
in addition  the dhcs will make an interim partial settlement payment to us if it terminates any of our state sponsored healthcare programs contracts early 
upon expiration of the term  if the account is in a surplus position  then no monies are owed to either party 
if the account is in a deficit position  then dhcs shall pay the amount of the deficit to us 
in no event  however  shall the amount paid by dhcs to us under the agreement exceed million or be less than an alternative minimum amount 
see results of operations western region operations reportable segment state sponsored health plans rate settlement agreement for information regarding how the alternative minimum amount is calculated 
the agreement also provides that the parties will cooperate in good faith to develop an alternative rate dispute resolution process within days of the execution of the agreement or such later date as the parties agree 
as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  the parties have not reached an agreement with respect to such an alternative rate dispute resolution process 
there can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately reach such an agreement  and if they are unable to do so  future rate disputes will be handled through the process currently in effect

we believe this unfavorable reserve development for the year ended december  was primarily due to significant delays in claims submissions for the fourth quarter of arising from issues related to a new billing format required by the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa coupled with an unanticipated flattening of commercial trends and higher commercial large group claims trend 
for the year ended december   health care cost was impacted by approximately million of favorable reserve development related to prior years 
this favorable development was primarily due to adjustments to our reserves that related to variables and uncertainties associated with our assumptions 
as our reserve balance for older months of service decreased  and estimates of our incurred costs for older dates of service became more certain and predictable  our estimates of incurred claims related to prior periods were adjusted accordingly 
these unfavorable and favorable prior period reserve developments were recorded as part of health care costs

days claims payable days claims payable dcp for the year ended december  was days compared with days for the year ended december  adjusted dcp  which we calculate in accordance with the paragraph below  for the year ended december  was days compared with days in the year ended december  set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted dcp  a non gaap financial measure  to the comparable gaap financial measure  dcp 
dcp is calculated by dividing the amount of reserve for claims and other settlements claims reserve by health plan services cost health plan costs during the year and multiplying that amount by the number of days in the year 
in this annual report on form k  the following table presents an adjusted dcp metric that subtracts capitation  provider and other claims settlements and medicare advantage prescription drug mapd payables costs from the claims reserve and health plan costs 
for the year ended december   adjusted dcp also subtracts reserve for claims and other settlements related to discontinued operations from the claims reserve 
management believes that adjusted dcp provides useful information to investors because the adjusted dcp calculation excludes from both claims reserve and health plan costs amounts related to health care costs for which no or minimal reserves are maintained 
in addition  solely with respect to the year ended december   adjusted dcp excludes from claims reserve the reserves relating to discontinued operations 
therefore  management believes that adjusted dcp may present a more accurate reflection of dcp than does gaap dcp  which includes such amounts 
this non gaap financial information should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis 
in evaluating the adjusted amounts  you should be aware that we have incurred expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation below and we may incur them again in the future

during the year ended december   a judgment was rendered in the amcareco litigation see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the amcareco litigation that resulted in deferred tax assets of million 
realization of these deferred tax assets was uncertain and therefore  a valuation allowance for the full amount was established 
the most significant change in the effective income tax rates from the to periods presented above is as a result of the absence of such litigation effects in additionally  our tax rate for the year ended december  is lower than the statutory federal rate of primarily due to the effect of tax exempt income and reductions of valuation allowances against deferred assets  which resulted from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards against gains on sale of the marketable securities 
such beneficial impacts are partially offset by the effect of certain compensation treated as non deductible under the aca 
the effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate of for the year ended december  primarily due to state income taxes  and most significantly due to the effect of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets established as a result of the decision rendered in in the amcareco litigation 
the effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate of for the year ended december  primarily due to state and local income taxes 
discontinued operation for the year ended december   we recorded tax expense of million net against the gain on sale of discontinued operation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale of our medicare pdp business 
an effective tax rate was only applicable to the year ended december  because that is the only period for which a gain on sale of discontinued operation was recorded 
the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment and a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  which resulted from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards against the gain on the sale of our medicare pdp business 
also in connection with the sale of our medicare pdp business  we classified the operating results of our medicare pdp business as discontinued operation  and accordingly  reclassified our results of operations for the years ended december  and we recorded tax benefits of million against losses from discontinued operation for the year ended december  we recorded tax expense of million and million net against the income from discontinued operation for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates related to income or loss from discontinued operation remained relatively constant throughout and at slightly above the federal statutory tax rate of due to state income taxes

our subsidiary  health net of california  inc hn california  participates in chip  which  in california  is known as the healthy families program 
commencing with the healthy families benefit year that started october   hn california no longer offers the healthy families epo product 
as a result  over  healthy families epo members have transitioned to other carriers in the counties we serve with this product 
in addition  hn california no longer offers the healthy families hmo in marin county  california  resulting in approximately members being transitioned to other carriers 
california coordinated care initiative in  the california legislature enacted the coordinated care initiative  or cci 
the stated purpose of the cci is to provide a more efficient health care delivery system and improved coordination of care to individuals that are fully eligible for medicare and medi cal benefits  or dual eligibles  as well as to all medi cal only beneficiaries who rely on long term services and supports  or ltss  which includes institutional long term care and home and community based services and other support services 
accordingly  in participating counties  the cci will establish a voluntary three year duals demonstration program to coordinate medical  behavioral health  long term institutional  and home and community based services for dual eligibles through a single health plan  and will require that all medi cal beneficiaries in participating counties join a medi cal managed care health plan to receive their medi cal benefits  including ltss 
the dhcs has selected eight counties to participate in the cci los angeles  san diego  orange  san bernardino  riverside  alameda  san mateo and santa clara 
health plans selected to participate in the cci in a given county will be required to provide a full range of benefits for medical services  including primary care and specialty physician  hospital and ancillary services  as well as behavioral and ltss 
on april   dhcs selected us to participate in the cci for both los angeles county and san diego county 
we currently do not provide all of the benefits required for participation in the cci  including  among others  custodial care in nursing homes and in home support services 
we will need to make arrangements to provide such benefits either directly or by subcontracting with other parties prior to the commencement of the cci 
dual eligibles are expected to receive advance notice regarding their enrollment options which varies by county 
as currently proposed  the duals demonstration would continue for a three year term ending december  and beginning no sooner than september  with initial enrollment occurring on a phased in basis based on birth date 
the dhcs has selected health net and the local initiative plan  la care health plan la care  for the cci in los angeles county 
la care is a public agency that serves low income persons in los angeles county through health coverage programs such as medi cal 
dual eligibles in los angeles county will be able to choose between an opt out option or choose either la care or us for benefits under the duals demonstration 
dual eligibles who opt out will continue to receive medi cal benefits through a managed care health plan under the cci  but will receive separate fee for service medicare benefits 
if no selection is made  the dual eligibles would be passively enrolled and allocated to either la care or us 
the methodology for this allocation process has yet to be determined 
the initial enrollment period in los angeles county will be phased in over months 
the dhcs has selected us and three other health plans for the cci in san diego county 
dual eligibles in san diego county will be able to select to receive benefits from any one of these health plans  or elect an opt out option similar to the option in los angeles county 
if no selection is made  the dual eligibles will be passively enrolled and allocated to one of the health plans 
the methodology for this allocation process has yet to be determined 
the initial enrollment period in san diego county will be phased in over months 
participation in the duals demonstration would require us to enter into a three way agreement with the dhcs and cms  under which  among other things  we would receive prospective blended capitated payments in an amount to be determined to provide coverage for dual eligibles 
the cci is subject to the approval of cms 
prior to cms determination on whether to approve the cci  various stakeholders have been given the opportunity to comment on the program  which may impact cms decision 
in addition  on an ongoing basis we will likely be required to make certain filings with  and obtain approvals from  the state of california department of managed health care the dmhc in connection with our proposed participation in the cci 
for example  on october   the dmhc approved certain modifications to the internal organizational structure of our subsidiaries related to our participation in the cci 
our participation in the cci  and the duals demonstration in particular  represents a significant new business opportunity for us 
however  we will not be able to participate in the cci in either los angeles or san diego county unless a number of objectives and conditions are met including  among others  our entry into a contract on satisfactory terms including  without limitation  satisfactory rates with the dhcs and cms for the cci and our execution of necessary modifications to our internal administrative and operations structure to meet the demands of the cci 
certain of these conditions are outside of our control and there can be no assurances that we will be able to meet all of the objectives and conditions necessary for our participation in the cci in los angeles county  san diego county or both 
in addition  the changes to our administrative and operations structure will include implementing delivery systems for benefits with which we have limited operating experience  including ltss 
we expect that we will incur material incremental costs to prepare for the cci 
if we do not participate in the cci in either county  this would result in the loss of some or all of the resources that have been and will be invested in this opportunity and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  if we participate in the cci in either los angeles or san diego county  there can be no assurance that this business opportunity will prove to be successful 
the cci is a model of providing health care that is new to regulatory authorities and health plans in the state of california 
our participation and success in the cci will be subject to a number of risks inherent in untested health care initiatives 
for example  there may be difficulties in the implementation of the duals demonstration that could detract from its acceptance by beneficiaries or increase our costs of participation in the duals demonstration 
in addition  our participation in the cci will require us to provide benefits with which we have limited operating experience  including but not limited to ltss 
our failure to organize and deliver on this new model would negatively affect the operating and financial success of this business opportunity 
some of the risks involved in our proposed participation in the cci include that dual eligibles are generally among the most chronically ill individuals within each of medicare and medi cal  requiring a complex range of services from multiple providers 
if we do not accurately predict the costs of providing benefits to dual eligibles or fail to obtain suitable rates under our agreement with cms and dhcs  our participation in the cci may prove to be unprofitable 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively design and implement the necessary modifications to our internal administrative and operations structure to meet the demands of the cci  which may negatively impact our profitability in the cci and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  our profitability in the cci will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully provide and administer ltss benefits  either directly or by subcontracting with other parties 
because we have limited operating experience in providing and administering this benefit  particularly with respect to cost management  there is no assurance that we will be able to make such arrangements on favorable terms  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
our failure to successfully participate in the cci could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and or results of operations 
for additional discussion of the various conditions and risks associated with our proposed participation in the cci  see item a 
risk factors we will not be able to participate in the duals demonstration portion of the california coordinated care initiative in los angeles county or san diego county unless a number of objectives and conditions are met and item a 
risk factors if we participate in the california coordinated care initiative in los angeles county and or san diego county  this business opportunity may prove to be unsuccessful for a number of reasons 
state sponsored health plans rate settlement agreement on november   our wholly owned subsidiaries  health net of california  inc and health net community solutions  inc  entered into an agreement with the dhcs to settle historical rate disputes with respect to our participation in medi cal for rate years prior to the rate year 
as part of the agreement  dhcs has agreed  among other things  to an extension of all of our medi cal managed care contracts existing on the date of the agreement for an additional five years from their existing expiration dates  a settlement account applicable to all of our state sponsored health care programs  including medi cal  healthy families  spd  the duals demonstration that is expected to begin in and any potential future medicaid expansion under federal health care reform  compensate us should dhcs terminate any of our state sponsored health care programs contracts early  and cooperate in good faith to develop an alternative rate dispute resolution process 
the agreement provides for the establishment of a settlement account the account 
the account was created on january  with an initial balance of zero  and will be settled in cash on december   except that under certain circumstances dhcs may extend the final settlement for up to three additional one year periods as may be extended  the term 
during the term  the deficit or surplus will be calculated annually and the resulting balance in the account will be adjusted accordingly 
cash settlement of the account will occur upon expiration of the term as provided in the agreement  subject to certain provisions for interim partial settlement payments to us in the event that dhcs terminates any of our state sponsored healthcare programs contracts early 
upon expiration of the term  if the account is in a surplus position  then no monies are owed to either party 
if the account is in a deficit position  then dhcs shall pay the amount of the deficit to us 
in no event  however  shall the amount paid by dhcs to us under the agreement exceed million or be less than an alternative minimum amount 
the alternative minimum amount is calculated as follows i million  minus ii any partial settlement payments previously made to us by dhcs  minus iii of the pre tax income on our state sponsored healthcare programs business in excess of a pre tax margin for each calendar year of the term 
under the agreement  dhcs will make an interim partial settlement payment to us based on a pro rata portion of the alternative minimum amount if it terminates any of our state sponsored healthcare programs contracts early 
we believe that the use of the account will help promote greater financial stability and predictability in our state health care programs business during the term 
the agreement also provides that the parties will cooperate in good faith to develop an alternative rate dispute resolution process within days of the execution of the agreement or such later date as the parties agree 
as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  the parties have not reached an agreement with respect to such an alternative rate dispute resolution process 
there can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately reach such an agreement  and if they are unable to do so  future rate disputes will be handled through the process currently in effect

government contracts reportable segment on april   we began delivery of administrative services under our t contract for the tricare north region 
the t contract was awarded to us on may  and became effective on april  we were the managed care contractor for the dod previous tricare contract in the north region  which ended on march  on march   the dod exercised option period  which commenced on april  the department of defense has notified us of its intent to exercise option period  which would extend our t contract through march  if all remaining option periods are exercised  the t contract would conclude on march   and if all remaining option periods are exercised  the t contract for the north region would conclude on march  under the t contract for the tricare north region  we provide various types of administrative services including provider network management  referral management  medical management  disease management  enrollment  customer service  clinical support service  and claims processing 
we also provided assistance in the transition activities related to the t contract 
these services are structured as cost reimbursement arrangements for health care costs plus administrative fees earned in the form of fixed prices  fixed unit prices  and contingent fees and payments based on various incentives and penalties 
we recognize revenue related to administrative services on a straight line basis over the option period  when the fees become fixed and determinable 
the t members are served by our network and out of network providers in accordance with the t contract 
we pay health care costs related to these services to the providers and are later reimbursed by the dod for such payments 
under the terms of the t contract  we are not the primary obligor for health care services and accordingly  we do not include health care costs and related reimbursements in our consolidated statement of operations 
the contract also includes various performance based incentives and penalties 
for each of the incentives or penalties  we adjust revenue accordingly based on the amount that we have earned or incurred at each interim date and are legally entitled to in the event of a contract termination 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading government contracts for additional information on the t contract 
in addition to the beneficiaries that we service under the t contract  we administer contracts with the us department of veterans affairs to manage community based outpatient clinics in seven states covering approximately  enrollees and provide behavioral health services to military families under the department of defense sponsored mflc program 
on august   our wholly owned subsidiary  mhn government services  entered into a new mflc contract awarded by the dod 
the newly awarded contract is a second generation contract under the mflc program 
the new contract has a five year term that includes a month base period and four month option periods 
mhn government services was the sole contractor under the original mflc contract  and is one of three contractors initially selected to participate in the mflc program under the new mflc contract 
as a result of the revised terms and structure of the new mflc contract and the government decision to award the new mflc contract to multiple contractors  we expect that the revenues we receive from the new contract will be substantially reduced in comparison to the original mflc contract 
mhn government services is currently providing counseling services to military service members and their families under the new mflc contract and simultaneously is transitioning out of the original mflc contract 
revenues from the mflc contracts were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

as a result of the award of the t contract for the tricare south region  responsibility for the delivery of services for the fort campbell area of kentucky and tennessee was realigned from the tricare north region to the tricare south region 
this realignment was expected  and as a result  effective april  we were no longer responsible for servicing the approximately  eligible beneficiaries in the fort campbell area under our t contract

year ended december  compared to year ended december  government contracts revenues decreased by  million  or percent  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in government contracts costs decreased by  million or percent for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in these declines were primarily due to the impact of the new t contract for the tricare north region  under which health care costs and related reimbursements are excluded from our consolidated statement of operations as a result of moving from a risk based contract to a cost reimbursement plus fixed fee contract 
our previous tricare contract for the north region included a target cost and underwriting fee for reimbursed health care costs  which was negotiated annually during the term of the contract with underruns and overruns of our target cost borne by the government and by us 
in the normal course of contracting with the federal government  we recognized changes in our estimate for the target cost underruns and overruns when the amounts became determinable  supportable  and the collectability was reasonably assured 
as a result of changes in the estimate during the year ended december   we recognized a decrease in revenue of million and a decrease in cost of million

liquidity and capital resources market and economic conditions the current state of the global economy and market conditions continue to be challenging with relatively high levels of unemployment  diminished business and consumer confidence  and volatility in both us and international capital and credit markets 
market conditions could limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities  or otherwise access capital markets for liquidity needs  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if our customer base experiences cash flow problems and other financial difficulties  it could  in turn  adversely impact membership in our plans 
for example  our customers may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products  may reduce the number of individuals to whom they provide coverage  or may make changes in the mix of products purchased from us 
in addition  if our customers experience financial issues  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
further  our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business 
a significant decline in membership in our plans and the inability of current and or potential customers to pay their premiums as a result of unfavorable conditions may adversely affect our business  including our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
cash and investments as of december   the fair value of the investment securities available for sale was billion  all in current investments 
we hold high quality fixed income securities primarily comprised of corporate bonds  mortgage backed bonds  municipal bonds and bank loans 
we evaluate and determine the classification of our investments based on management s intent 
we also closely monitor the fair values of our investment holdings and regularly evaluate them for other than temporary impairments 
our cash flow from investing activities is primarily impacted by the sales  maturities and purchases of our available for sale investment securities and restricted investments 
our investment objective is to maintain safety and preservation of principal by investing in a diversified mix of high quality fixed income securities  which are largely investment grade  while maintaining liquidity in each portfolio sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements and attaining an expected total return on invested funds 
our investment holdings are primarily currently comprised of investment grade securities and have an average rating of a and a as rated by s p and or moody s  respectively 
at this time  there is no indication of default on interest and or principal payments under our holdings 
we have the ability and current intent to hold to recovery all securities with an unrealized loss position 
as of december   our investment portfolio includes million  or of our portfolio holdings  of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the majority of our mortgage backed securities are fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae issues  and the average rating of our entire asset backed securities is aa aa however  any failure by fannie mae or freddie mac to honor the obligations under the securities they have issued or guaranteed could cause a significant decline in the value or cash flow of our mortgage backed securities 
as of december   our investment portfolio also included million  or of our portfolio holdings  of obligations of state and other political subdivisions and million  or of our portfolio holdings  of corporate debt securities 
we had gross unrealized losses of million as of december   and million as of december  included in the gross unrealized losses as of december  are million related to noncurrent investments available for sale 
we believe that these impairments are temporary and we do not intend to sell these investments 
it is not likely that we will be required to sell any security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved  there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other than temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 
no impairment was recognized during the years ended december  or liquidity we believe that expected cash flow from operating activities  any existing cash reserves  other working capital and lines of credit are adequate to allow us to fund existing obligations  repurchase shares of our common stock  introduce new products and services  enter into new lines of business and continue to operate and develop health care related businesses at least for the next twelve months 
we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations and commitments  for acquisitions and other strategic transactions and for business expansion opportunities  such as the state of california duals demonstration 
we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes  either through issuance of debt or equity  the sale of investment securities or otherwise  as appropriate 
based on the composition and quality of our investment portfolio  our expected ability to liquidate our investment portfolio as needed  and our expected operating and financing cash flows  we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment 
however  continued turbulence in us and international markets and certain costs associated with the implementation of health care reform legislation and costs associated with our proposed participation in the cci  among other things  could adversely affect our liquidity 
our cash flow from operating activities is impacted by  among other things  the timing of collections on our amounts receivable from state and federal governments and agencies 
our receivable from cms related to our medicare business was million as of december  and million as of december  the receivable from dhcs related to our california medicaid business was million as of december  and million as of december  our receivable from the dod relating to our current and prior contracts for the tricare north region were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the timing of collection of such receivables is impacted by government audit and can extend for periods beyond a year 
our total cash and cash equivalents as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
the changes in cash and cash equivalents are summarized as follows year ended december  dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the timing of the receivable from dhcs related to our california medicaid business 
the receivable from dhcs was million as of december  compared to million as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to million in payments related to the amcareco litigation judgment 
investing activities our cash flow from investing activities is primarily impacted by the sales  maturities and purchases of our available for sale investment securities and restricted investments 
our investment objective is to maintain safety and preservation of principal by investing in high quality  primarily investment grade securities while maintaining liquidity in each portfolio sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements and attaining the highest total return on invested funds 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in investing activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in net purchases of investments in available for sale securities and million received from united for additional consideration related to the northeast sale during  partially offset by million received for the sale of our medicare pdp business during year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities increased by million compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in net sales and maturities of investments in available for sale securities and by an million increase in cash received from united for additional consideration related to the northeast sale  partially offset by a million increase in purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities increased by million primarily due to a million decrease in share repurchases  a million increase in customer funds administered and a million increase in checks outstanding  partially offset by a net decrease in revolving credit facility borrowings of million in customer funds administered include pass through items and items accounted for under deposit accounting and are comprised of health care cost payments and reimbursements for the t contract  catastrophic reinsurance subsidy  low income member cost sharing subsidy and the coverage gap discount under the medicare part d program 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the t contract and medicare part d 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in financing activities increased by million primarily due to a million increase in share repurchases  a million increase in customer funds administered  a million decrease in checks outstanding net of deposits and million in debt issuance costs  partially offset by a million increase in net borrowings under our revolving credit facility  a million decrease in amounts paid under our amortizing financing facility due to the payoff of that facility in june and a million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 
capital structure our debt to total capital ratio was percent as of december  compared with percent as of december  this decrease was driven by a decrease in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and an increase in stockholders equity primarily resulting from net income offset by share repurchases

termination of amortizing financing facility on may   we terminated our five year non interest bearing  million amortizing financing facility with a non us lender that we entered into on december  by exercising our option to call the facility 
in connection with the call  we recorded a million pretax early debt extinguishment charge in the quarter ended june  senior notes we have issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes 
the indenture governing the senior notes limits our ability to incur certain liens  or consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in the event of the occurrence of both a change of control of health net  inc and a below investment grade rating by any two of fitch  inc  moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s ratings services  within a specified period  we will be required to make an offer to purchase the senior notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase

statutory capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital and surplus requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
management believes that as of december   all of our active health plans and insurance subsidiaries met their respective regulatory requirements relating to maintenance of minimum capital standards  surplus requirements and adequate reserves for claims in all material respects 
by law  regulation and governmental policy  our health plan and insurance subsidiaries  which we refer to as our regulated subsidiaries  are required to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus 
the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  or risk based capital rbc or tangible net equity tne requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
the rbc formula  which calculates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which represents the minimum amount of capital and surplus believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain the greater of the company action level rbc  calculated as of the acl  or the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
because our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight authority  some of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital and surplus in excess of the rbc requirement  even though rbc has been adopted in their states of domicile 
under the california knox keene health care service plan act of  as amended knox keene  certain of our california subsidiaries must comply with tne requirements 
under these knox keene tne requirements  actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of i a fixed minimum amount  ii a minimum amount based on premiums or iii a minimum amount based on health care expenditures  excluding capitated amounts 
in addition  certain of our california subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the department of managed health care dmhc to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates  to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities tne below the minimum requirement or of the minimum requirement  or reduce the cash to claims ratio below at december   all of our subsidiaries subject to the tne requirements and the undertakings to dmhc exceeded the minimum requirements 
as necessary  we make contributions to and issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations 
during the year ended december   we made capital contributions of million to a subsidiary 
health net  inc made no capital contributions to any of its subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations from january  through february  legislation may be enacted in certain states in which our subsidiaries operate imposing substantially increased minimum capital and or statutory deposit requirements for hmos in such states 
such statutory deposits may only be drawn upon under limited circumstances relating to the protection of policyholders 
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements  certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies 
such restrictions  unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted  limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations 
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus  statutory income and unassigned surplus 
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations as of december  are summarized below for the years ending december total thereafter dollars in millions fixed rate borrowing principal c fixed rate borrowing interest variable rate borrowing principal variable rate borrowing interest operating leases long term purchase obligations uncertain tax positions liability  including interest and penalties b deferred compensation a estimated future payments for pension and other benefits a a represents estimated future payments from through b the obligations shown above represent uncertain tax positions expected to be paid within the reporting periods presented 
in addition to the obligations shown above  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as a liability  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled or paid 
c these amounts are based on stated terms and expected payments 
as such  they differ from the amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheet and notes  which are reported consistently with the financial reporting and classification requirements 
operating leases we lease office space under various operating leases 
certain leases are cancelable with substantial penalties 
see item properties for additional information regarding our leases 
long term purchase obligations and commitments we have entered into long term agreements to purchase various services  which may contain certain termination provisions and have remaining terms in excess of one year as of december  we have entered into long term agreements to receive services related to disease management  case management  wellness  pharmacy benefit management  pharmacy claims processing services and health quality risk scoring enhancement services with external third party service providers 
the remaining terms are approximately from two to four years for each of these contracts 
termination of these agreements is subject to certain termination provisions 
as of december   the total estimated future commitments under these agreements were million and are included in the table above 
we have entered into an agreement with international business machines corporation ibm to outsource our it infrastructure management services including data center services  it security management and help desk support 
as of december   the remaining term of this contract was approximately one year with options to renew for up to eighteen months  and total estimated future commitments under the agreement were approximately million 
we have entered into an agreement with cognizant technology solutions us corporation cognizant to outsource our software applications development and management activities to cognizant 
under the terms of the agreement  cognizant will  among other things  provide us with application development  testing and monitoring services  application maintenance and support services  project management services and cross functional services 
as of december   the remaining term of this contract was approximately one year with options to renew for up to two years  and the total estimated future commitments under the agreement were approximately million 
we have also entered into another agreement with cognizant to outsource a substantial portion of our claims processing activities to cognizant 
under the terms of the agreement  cognizant will  among other things  provide us with claims adjudication  adjustment  audit and process improvement services 
as of december   the remaining term of this contract was approximately four years  and the total estimated future commitments under the agreement were approximately million 
we have excluded from the table above amounts already recorded in our current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have also excluded from the table above various contracts we have entered into with our health care providers  health care facilities  the federal government and other contracts that we have entered into for the purpose of providing health care services 
we have excluded those contracts that allow for cancellation without significant penalty  obligations that are contingent upon achieving certain goals and contracts for goods and services that are fulfilled by vendors within a short time horizon and within the normal course of business 
the future contractual obligations in the contractual obligations table are estimated based on information currently available 
the timing of and the actual payment amounts may differ based on actual events 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under regulation s k a and the instructions thereto 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our letters of credit 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include revenue recognition  health care costs  including ibnr amounts  reserves for contingent liabilities  amounts receivable or payable under government contracts  goodwill and other intangible assets  recoverability of long lived assets and investments  and income taxes 
accordingly  we consider accounting policies on these areas to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a significant change in any one of these amounts may have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that we use in preparing our financial statements is included in note to our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
health plan services health plan services premium revenues generally include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts including part d to provide care and services to enrolled medicare recipients 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the related enrollees are entitled to health care services 
premiums collected in advance of the month in which enrollees are entitled to health care services are recorded as unearned premiums 
approximately   and in  and  respectively  of our health plan services premium revenues were generated under medicare and medicaid medi cal contracts 
these revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by the respective fiscal intermediaries 
laws and regulations governing these programs  including cms proposed methodology with respect to risk adjustment data validation radv audits and the aca  are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount 
our medicare advantage contracts are with cms 
cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs 
under this risk adjustment methodology  cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient  hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings 
we and the health care providers collect  compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms 
on a monthly basis  we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables to reflect allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical collection rates and the age of our unpaid balances 
during this process  we also assess the recoverability of the receivables  and an allowance is recorded based upon their net realizable value 
those receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible  such as receivables from bankrupt employer groups  are fully written off against their corresponding asset account  with a debit to the allowance to the extent such an allowance was previously recorded 
reserves for claims and other settlements include reserves for claims ibnr claims and received but unprocessed claims  and other liabilities including capitation payable  shared risk settlements  provider disputes  provider incentives and other reserves for our western region operations reporting segment 
because reserves for claims include various actuarially developed estimates  our actual health care services expenses may be more or less than our previously developed estimates 
as of december   of reserves for claims and other settlements were attributed to claims reserves 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of changes in the reserve for claims and material prior period reserve development 
we calculate our best estimate of the amount of our ibnr reserves in accordance with gaap and using standard actuarial developmental methodologies 
this method is also known as the chain ladder or completion factor method 
the developmental method estimates reserves for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid while taking into consideration  among other things  expected medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
a key component of the developmental method is the completion factor  which is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the claims for services rendered for a given period 
while the completion factors are reliable and robust for older service periods  they are more volatile and less reliable for more recent periods since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been rendered 
accordingly  for the most recent months  the incurred claims are estimated from a trend analysis based on per member per month claims trends developed from the experience in preceding months 
this method is applied consistently year over year while assumptions may be adjusted to reflect changes in medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership  among other things 
an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the estimates are highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
as such  the completion factors and the claims per member per month trend factor are the most significant factors used in estimating our reserves for claims 
since a large portion of the reserves for claims is attributed to the most recent months  the estimated reserves for claims are highly sensitive to these factors 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by these factors completion factor a percentage point increase decrease in factor western region operations health plan services decrease increase in reserves for claims million million million million medical cost trend b percentage point increase decrease in factor western region operations health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to the estimate of total claims for a given period 
therefore  an increase in completion factor percent results in a decrease in the remaining estimated reserves for claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trend used to estimate the per member per month cost for the most recent three months 
our ibnr best estimate also includes a provision for adverse deviation  which is an estimate for known environmental factors that are reasonably likely to affect the required level of ibnr reserves 
this provision for adverse deviation is intended to capture the potential adverse development from known environmental factors such as our entry into new geographical markets  changes in our geographic or product mix  the introduction of new customer populations such as our spd population in california  variation in benefit utilization  disease outbreaks  changes in provider reimbursement  fluctuations in medical cost trend  variation in claim submission patterns and variation in claims processing speed and payment patterns  changes in technology that provide faster access to claims data or change the speed of adjudication and settlement of claims  variability in claim inventory levels  non standard claim development  and or exceptional situations that require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims 
as part of our best estimate for ibnr  the provision for adverse deviation recorded at december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
there were no material changes in the amount of these reserves  or the amount of these reserves as a percentage of reserve for claims and other settlements  between december  and december  we consistently apply our ibnr estimation methodology from period to period 
our ibnr best estimate is made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required 
any adjustments to the prior period estimates are included in the current period 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our assumptions accordingly to change our estimate of ibnr 
therefore  if moderately adverse conditions do not occur  evidenced by more complete claims information in the following period  then our prior period estimates will be revised downward  resulting in favorable development 
however  any favorable prior period reserve development would increase current period net income only to the extent that the current period provision for adverse deviation is less than the benefit recognized from the prior period favorable development 
if moderately adverse conditions occur and are more acute than we estimated  then our prior period estimates will be revised upward  resulting in unfavorable development  which would decrease current period net income 
for the year ended december   health care cost was impacted by approximately million attributable to the revision of the previous estimate of incurred claims for prior years as a result of adverse prior year development 
for the year ended december   health care cost was impacted by approximately million of favorable reserve development related to prior years 
we assess the profitability of contracts for providing health care services when operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses 
significant factors that can lead to a change in our profitability estimates include premium yield and health care cost trend assumptions  risk share terms and non performance of a provider under a capitated agreement resulting in membership reverting to fee for service arrangements with other providers 
contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of determining premium rates 
losses are determined by comparing anticipated premiums to estimates for the total of health care related costs less reinsurance recoveries  if any  and the cost of maintaining the contracts 
losses  if any  are recognized in the period the losses are determined and are classified as health plan services 
we held million and million in premium deficiency reserves as of december  and  respectively 
government contracts on april   we began delivering administrative services under the t contract for the tricare north region 
we were the managed care contractor for the dod previous tricare contract in the north region  which ended on march  under the t contract for the tricare north region  we provide various types of administrative services  including provider network management  referral management  medical management  disease management  enrollment  customer service  clinical support service  and claims processing 
we also provided assistance in the transition into the t contract  and will provide assistance in any transition out of the t contract 
these services are structured as cost reimbursement arrangements for health care costs plus administrative fees earned in the form of fixed prices  fixed unit prices  and contingent fees and payments based on various incentives and penalties 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate  at the inception of the contract and as services are delivered  all deliverables in the service arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
the delivered items are considered separate units of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis ie  they are sold separately by any vendor and no general right of return exists relative to the delivered item 
while we identified two separate units of accounting within the t contract  no determination of estimated selling price was performed because both units of accounting are performed ratably over the option periods and  accordingly  the same methodology of revenue recognition applies to both units of accounting 
therefore  we recognize revenue related to administrative services on a straight line basis over the option period  when the fees become fixed and determinable 
the t contract includes various performance based incentives and penalties 
for each of the incentives or penalties  we adjust revenue accordingly based on the amount that we have earned or incurred at each interim date and are legally entitled to in the event of a contract termination 
revenues and expenses associated with the t contract are reported as part of government contracts revenues and government contracts expenses  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations and included in our government contracts reportable segment 
amounts receivable under government contracts are comprised primarily of contractually defined billings  accrued contract incentives under the terms of the contract and amounts related to change orders for services not originally specified in the contract 
pursuant to our t contract  the government has the right to unilaterally modify the contract in certain respects by issuing change orders directing us to implement terms or services that were not originally included in the contract 
following receipt of a change order  we have a contractual right to negotiate an equitable adjustment to the contract terms to account for the impact of the change order 
we start to perform under such change orders and begin to incur associated costs after we receive the government unilateral modification  but before we have negotiated the final scope and or value of the change order 
in these situations  costs are expensed as incurred  and we estimate and record revenue when we have met all applicable revenue recognition criteria 
these criteria include the requirements that change order amounts are determinable  that we have performed under the change orders  and that collectability of amounts payable to us is reasonably assured 
reserves for contingent liabilities in the course of our operations  we are involved on a routine basis in various disputes with members  health care providers  and other entities or individuals  as well as audits by government agencies and elected officials that relate to our services and or business practices that expose us to potential losses 
we recognize an estimated loss  which may represent damages  assessment of regulatory fines or penalties  settlement costs  future legal expenses or a combination of the foregoing  as appropriate  from such loss contingencies when it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loss estimates are based in part on an analysis of potential results  the stage of the proceedings  consultation with outside counsel and any other relevant information available 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets arise primarily as a result of various business acquisitions 
goodwill consists of the excess of the cost of acquisitions over the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
other intangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets acquired and the value of employer group contracts  provider networks and customer relationships  which are all subject to amortization 
on april   we completed the sale of our medicare pdp business 
our medicare pdp business was previously reported as part of our western region operations reporting unit 
as of march   we re allocated a portion of the western region operations reporting unit goodwill to the medicare pdp business based on relative fair values of the reporting unit with and without the medicare pdp business 
our measurement of fair value is based on a combination of the income approach based on a discounted cash flow methodology and the discounted total consideration received in connection with the sale of our medicare pdp business 
after the reallocation of goodwill  we performed a two step impairment test to determine the existence of any impairment and the amount of the impairment 
in the first step  we compared the fair value to the related carrying value and concluded that no impairment to either the carrying value of our medicare pdp business or our western region operations reporting unit had occurred 
based on the result of the first step test  we did not need to complete the second step test 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale of our medicare pdp business and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional goodwill fair value measurement information 
we perform our annual impairment test on our recorded goodwill as of june or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of these assets for each of our reporting units 
we performed our annual impairment test on our goodwill and other intangible assets as of june  for our western region operations reporting unit  and no impairment was identified 
we performed a two step impairment test to determine the existence of impairment and the amount of the impairment 
in the first step  we compared the fair values to the related carrying values and concluded that the carrying value of the western region operations was not impaired 
as a result  the second step was not performed 
we also re evaluated the useful lives of our other intangible assets and determined that the current estimated useful lives were properly reflected 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of recorded goodwill  changes in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment test 
the discounted cash flows and market participant valuations and the resulting fair value estimates of the western region operations reporting unit are sensitive to changes in assumptions including  among others  certain valuation and market assumptions  our ability to adequately incorporate into our premium rates the future costs of premium based assessments imposed by the aca  and assumptions related to the achievement of certain administrative cost reductions and the profitable implementation of the duals demonstration 
changes to any of these assumptions could cause the fair value of our western region operations reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
the ratio of the fair value of our western region operations to its carrying value was approximately and as of june  and  respectively 
recoverability of long lived assets and investments we periodically assess the recoverability of our long lived assets including property and equipment and other long term assets and investments where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value as follows long lived assets held and used we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if we identify an indicator of impairment  we assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in impairment charges to general and administrative expenses primarily for internally developed software 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of the income taxes topic of financial accounting standards board fasb codification 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits from our deferred tax assets only when an analysis of both positive and negative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
we file tax returns in many tax jurisdictions 
often  application of tax rules within the various jurisdictions is subject to differing interpretation 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that it is probable certain positions will be challenged by taxing authorities  and we may not prevail on the positions as filed 
accordingly  we maintain a liability for the estimated amount of contingent tax challenges by taxing authorities upon examination 
we analyze the amount at which each tax position meets a more likely than not standard for sustainability upon examination by taxing authorities 
only tax benefit amounts meeting or exceeding this standard will be reflected in tax provision expense and deferred tax asset balances 
any differences between the amounts of tax benefits reported on tax returns and tax benefits reported in the financial statements is recorded in a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reported separately from deferred tax assets and liabilities and classified as current or noncurrent based upon the expected period of payment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to our investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and or market conditions and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining variable interest rate earning investments and fixed rate liabilities or fixed income investments and variable rate liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risks arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception that may affect the value of financial instruments 
we attempt to manage the interest rate risks related to our investment portfolios by actively managing the asset duration of our investment portfolios 
the overall goal for the investment portfolios is to provide a source of liquidity and support the ongoing operations of our business units 
our philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit has additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
we manage these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
we use a value at risk var model  which follows a variance co variance methodology  to assess the market risk for our investment portfolio 
var is a method of assessing investment risk that uses standard statistical techniques to measure the worst expected loss in the portfolio over an assumed portfolio disposition period under normal market conditions 
the determination is made at a given statistical confidence level 
we assumed a portfolio disposition period of days with a confidence level of for the computation of var for the computation further assumes that the distribution of returns is normal 
based on such methodology and assumptions  the computed var was approximately million as of december  our calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on our investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our investment portfolios during the year 
except for those securities held by trustees or regulatory agencies see note to our consolidated financial statements  all of our investment securities are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between cost and estimated fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  a component of stockholders equity see note to our consolidated financial statements 
all of our investment securities are fixed income securities 
approximately of our available for sale investment securities are asset backed securities abs mortgage backed securities mbs 
approximately of the abs mbs are agency securities 
therefore  we believe that our exposure to credit related market value risk for our mbs is limited 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to increase 
however  these securities may be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
the recent disruptions in the credit markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments 
however  such disruptions did not have a material impact to the liquidity of our investments 
a worsening of credit market function or sustained market downturns could have negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which totaled million as of december   are subject to variable interest rates 
for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our floating rate borrowings  if any  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these borrowings  if any  are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate borrowing  which consists of only our senior notes  as of december  was approximately million  which was based on quoted market prices 
where quoted market prices were not readily available  fair values were estimated using valuation methodologies based on available and observable market information 
such valuation methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing  comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business  and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows 
the following table presents the expected cash outflows relating to market risk sensitive debt obligations as of december  these cash outflows include expected principal and interest payments consistent with the terms of the outstanding debt as of december  thereafter total amounts in millions fixed rate borrowing principal interest cash outflow on fixed rate borrowing variable rate borrowing principal interest cash outflow on variable rate borrowing total cash outflow on borrowings
