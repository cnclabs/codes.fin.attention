item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in item of this annual report and the risk factors discussed under item a  risk factors 
overview we are an externally managed real estate investment and finance company that was organized in june primarily to acquire  originate and manage a diversified portfolio of real estate related debt and equity investments at attractive risk adjusted returns 
our investment portfolio and target assets are primarily composed of interests in i secondary loans acquired at a discount to par  ii new originations  and iii equity in single family homes to be held for investment and rented to tenants 
secondary debt purchases may include performing  sub performing or non performing loans including loan to own strategies 
we invest in single family homes through our investment in csfr op  a newly formed investment vehicle sponsored and managed by an affiliate of our manager 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit  and generally are not subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income to stockholders and maintain 
table of contents qualification as a reit  although we are subject to us federal income tax on income earned through our taxable subsidiaries 
we also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the act 
business objective and outlook our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our investors through a diversified portfolio of real estate related debt and equity investments  including single family homes to be rented to tenants 
the total return profile of our investments is composed of both current yield  which is distributed through regular way dividends  and capital appreciation potential  which is distributed through regular way and or special dividends 
our investments typically fall within three general categories acquisitions the purchase of performing  sub performing and or non performing commercial real estate debt  often at significant discounts to par  originations the origination of structured senior and subordinate debt secured by mortgages and or equity interests in commercial real estate with a bias towards current yield  and single family homes the acquisition of single family homes to be rented to tenants 
we also may pursue other real estate related special situation investments including cmbs  sale leasebacks  triple net lease investments and minority equity interests in banks 
our investments are diversified across a wide spectrum of commercial real estate property types office  industrial  retail  multifamily  hospitality and single family residential and geographically  with investments across the united states and europe 
significant dislocation has occurred in global real estate credit markets since the financial downturn  and while the market is in the process of recovery  we continue to find opportunities to acquire financial and real estate assets that we believe are mispriced relative to intrinsic value of the underlying collateral 
we believe the recovery will occur in two general phases phase one will involve many loan acquisition opportunities as financial institutions around the globe deleverage and divest of troubled assets  and phase two will involve an increasing number of loan originations and property acquisitions as commercial real estate fundamentals continue to stabilize and commercial real estate assets are refinanced or acquired with new capital based on revised underwriting  valuation and operating metrics 
we believe phases one and two are actively underway in the united states  whereas europe is lagging and is currently producing mostly loan acquisition opportunities 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on such opportunities sourcing transactions through the numerous relationships enjoyed by our manager through its two decade history in the real estate investment business 
we also believe that our manager s in depth understanding of commercial real estate and real estate related investments including our target assets  and in house underwriting and asset management capabilities  enable us to acquire assets with attractive risk adjusted return profiles and the potential for meaningful capital appreciation

we believe there will be many benefits to our investing in single family homes through csfr op  including the following our investment will enjoy diversity in terms of the markets we have exposure to and the number of homes owned  as part of a larger pool of homes  we may benefit from economies of scale both in terms of acquisition opportunities participation in acquisitions of larger pools of homes where competition is often scarcer as well as property management costs either through obtaining better terms from vendors or from having the scale to self manage  potentially better access to the private and public capital markets which may provide more options to grow the business as well as more options for potential exit strategies

midwest multifamily retail loan 
in may  the midwest multifamily retail loan fully repaid approximately million at maturity including an exit fee 
the loan was originated in may by us and a co investment fund as a million loan 
our share of the loan was some of the loans in our investment portfolio are in the process of being restructured or may otherwise be under credit watch or at risk 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
if we determine that it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts according to the terms of a particular loan agreement  we could be required to recognize an impairment charge or a loss on the loan 
if our assumptions regarding  among other things  the present value of expected future cash flows or the value of the collateral securing our loans are incorrect or general economic and financial conditions cause a significant number of borrowers to become unable to make payments under their loans  we could be required to recognize significant impairment charges  which could result in a material reduction in earnings and distributions in the period in which the loans are determined to be impaired 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material 
table of contents effect on our financial statements 
the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that we believe are critical based on the nature of our operations  and applies to both the company and our unconsolidated joint ventures 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made  based upon information available to us at that time 
this discussion is intended to supplement the description of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures many of our investments have been structured as joint ventures with one or more co investment funds pursuant to an investment allocation agreement see business co investment funds 
the joint ventures are generally capitalized through equity contributions from the members  although certain investments are leveraged through various financing arrangements 
our exposure to the joint ventures is limited to amounts invested or committed to the joint ventures at inception  and neither we nor the other investors are required to provide financial or other support in excess of their capital commitments 
in some cases these joint ventures are considered to be variable interest entities vies 
generally  a vie is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics a the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  b as a group  the holders of the equity investment at risk lack i the power  through voting rights or similar rights  to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its financial performance  ii the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  or iii the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  or c the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve  or are conducted on behalf of  an investor including its related parties that has disproportionately few voting rights 
in certain circumstances  we hold of the voting rights to elect the board of directors of the joint venture  but own varying economic interests  which currently range from to 
in other cases  our voting rights are proportional to our economic interests  however the joint ventures are subject to management or other contracts that create vies 
gaap requires a vie to be consolidated in the financial statements of the entity that is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the primary beneficiary generally is the entity that has both the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb expected losses of  or the right to receive benefits from  the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
we have analyzed each of the joint ventures and determined that either they are not vies and we do not have a controlling financial interest  or they are vies but we are not the primary beneficiary 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider qualitative and quantitative factors  including  but not limited to the amount and characteristics of our investment  the obligation or likelihood that we or other investors will be required to provide financial support  our and the other investors ability to control or significantly influence key decisions for the vie  and the similarity and significance of the vie s business activities to our and the other investors business activities 
significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of assets held by the vies and general market conditions 
since we do not consolidate the joint ventures but have significant influence over their operating and financial policies  we account for our investments in joint ventures using the equity method 
under the equity method  we initially record investments in unconsolidated joint ventures at cost and adjust for our proportionate share of net earnings or losses  cash contributions made and distributions received  and other adjustments  as appropriate 
distributions of operating profit from joint ventures are reported as part of operating cash flows on our statement of cash flows 
distributions related to a capital transaction  such as a refinancing transaction or sale  are reported as investing activities on our statement of cash flows 
we perform a quarterly evaluation of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures to determine whether the fair value of our interest in each joint venture is less than the carrying value  and  if such decrease in value deemed to be is other than temporary  we write down our investment to fair value 
loans receivable and interest income recognition we originate and purchase loans receivable 
originated loans are recorded at amortized cost  or the upb less net deferred loan fees 
net deferred loan fees include unamortized origination and other fees charged to the borrower less direct incremental loan origination costs we incurred 
purchased loans are recorded at amortized cost  or the upb less unamortized purchase discount 
costs to purchase loans are expensed as incurred 
interest income is recognized based upon the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans 
purchase discount or net deferred loan fees are amortized over the expected life of the loans using the effective yield method except on revolving loans  for which the straight line method is used 
when a loan is prepaid  prepayment fees and any excess of proceeds over the carrying amount of the loan are recognized as a gain 
past due loans we place loans on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is more than days past due  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest 
when we place a loan on nonaccrual 
table of contents status  we reverse the accrual for unpaid interest and do not recognize interest income until we receive cash and the loan returns to accrual status 
generally  a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest are brought current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and the borrower has met certain performance criteria 
impairment we evaluate our loans for impairment on a quarterly basis 
we regularly analyze the extent and effect of any credit migration from underwriting and the initial investment review associated with a loan s performance and or value of underlying collateral as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower sponsor 
specifically  a property s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess i whether cash from operations are sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future  ii the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan  and or iii the property s liquidation value 
where applicable  we also evaluate the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower s competency in managing and operating the properties 
a loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a loan is also considered to be impaired if it has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring tdr involving a modification of terms as a concession resulting from the debtor s financial difficulties 
we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the loan valuation is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to allowance for loan loss 
acquired credit distressed loans we acquire credit distressed loans for which we expect to collect less than the contractual amounts due under the terms of the loan based  at least in part  on the assessment of the credit quality of the borrower 
acquired credit distressed loans are recorded at the initial investment in the loans and accreted to the estimated cash flows expected to be collected measured at acquisition date 
the excess of cash flows expected to be collected measured at acquisition date over the initial investment accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the effective interest method 
the excess of contractually required payments at the acquisition date over expected cash flows nonaccretable difference is not recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual or valuation allowance 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized prospectively through an adjustment to the loan s accretable yield over its remaining life  which may result in a reclassification from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield 
subsequent decreases in cash flows expected to be collected are evaluated to determine whether a provision for loan loss should be established 
if decreases in expected cash flows result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of the loan below its amortized cost  the company will record a provision for loan losses calculated as the difference between the loan s amortized cost and the revised cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective yield 
acquired credit distressed loans may be aggregated into pools based upon common risk characteristics  such as loan performance  collateral type and or geographic location of the collateral 
once a loan pool is identified  a composite yield and estimate of cash flows expected to be collected including expected prepayments are used to recognize interest income 
a loan resolution within a loan pool  which may involve the sale of the loan or foreclosure on the underlying collateral  results in the removal of an allocated carrying amount 
a loan modified in a tdr within a loan pool remains in the loan pool  with the effect of the modification incorporated into the expected future cash flows 
investment in real estate acquired property is recorded at the purchase price  allocated among land  building  improvements  in place leases and equipment based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we evaluate each purchase transaction to determine whether the acquired assets meet the definition of a business 
transaction costs related to acquisitions that are not deemed to be businesses are included in the cost basis of the acquired assets  while transaction costs related to acquisitions that are deemed to be businesses are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which generally range from to years for buildings and improvements and to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred  while expenditures for significant renovations that improve or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
rental income rental income from residential leases is recognized on a straight line basis  which is not materially different than if it were recorded when due from residents and recognized monthly as it was earned 
certain costs incurred to lease vacant homes  including leasing commissions and other fees  are capitalized and amortized over the term of the lease 
rents received in advance are deferred 
fair value measurement 
table of contents we determine the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level prices are determined using other significant observable inputs 
observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security 
these may include quoted prices for similar securities  interest rates  prepayment speeds  credit risk and others 
level prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs 
in situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable for example  when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period  unobservable inputs may be used 
we record certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis when required by gaap 
examples of financial instruments we own that are required by gaap to be carried at fair value are derivative instruments and debt securities designated as available for sale 
we have not elected the fair value option for financial instruments not required to be carried at fair value by gaap 
we carry those financial instruments at amortized cost and separately disclose the fair value on a quarterly basis 
these instruments are recorded at fair value only if they are impaired 
in cases where quoted market prices are not available  fair values are estimated using inputs such as discounted cash flow projections  market comparables  dealer quotes and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
the fair values of foreign exchange contracts are determined by discounting the expected cash flow of each instrument based on forecast foreign exchange rates 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  observable market based inputs  and credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the non performance risk for both the company and the respective counterparty 
the fair value of debt securities and loans are generally determined by discounting the expected cash flows using observable current and forward rates of applicable published indices 
fair values of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are primarily derived by applying our ownership interest to the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of each joint venture 
our proportionate share of each joint venture s fair value approximates our fair value of the investment as the timing of cash flows of the joint venture does not deviate materially from the timing of cash flows we receive from the joint venture 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value 
the use of different assumptions or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
income taxes and reit compliance we elected to be taxed as a reit  commencing with our initial taxable year ended december  a reit is generally not subject to corporate level federal and state income tax on net income it distributes to its stockholders 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
even if we qualify as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state  local and foreign taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 
we have elected or may elect to treat certain of our subsidiaries as trss 
in general  a trs of a reit may perform non customary services for tenants of the reit  hold assets that the reit cannot hold directly and  subject to certain exceptions related to hotels and healthcare properties  may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business 
a trs is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal  state  local  and foreign taxes on its income and property

cash from investments our investments generate cash  either from operations or as a return of our invested capital 
we receive monthly or quarterly distributions from some of our unconsolidated joint ventures from earnings  principal receipts or capital transactions such as financing transactions or full or partial loan sales 
we also receive interest and principal on our loans held for investment 
as loans reach their maturity we may receive all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance 
certain loans held for investment require minimum principal payments  including partial paydowns of principal in the event of a sale of the underlying collateral

at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and we expect to continue to meet all financial and reporting requirements 
however  in the event of an economic slow down  volatility in the credit markets  and rising cost of capital  there is no certainty that we will be able to continue to meet all of the covenant requirements

non gaap supplemental financial measure core earnings core earnings is a non gaap measure and is defined as gaap net income loss excluding non cash equity compensation expense  incentive fees  real estate depreciation and amortization and any unrealized gains or losses from mark to market valuation changes other than permanent impairment that are included in net income 
the amount is adjusted to exclude one time events pursuant to changes in gaap and certain other non cash items after discussions between the manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors 
we believe that core earnings is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance 
the exclusion from core earnings of the items specified above allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
core earnings is also the basis upon which the incentive fee to our manager is calculated 
also  since some of our competitors use a similar supplemental measure  it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other similar reits 
however  other reits may use different methodologies to calculate core earnings  and accordingly  our calculation of core earnings may not be comparable to other similar reits that present similar supplemental measures 
core earnings does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
portions of adjustments to gaap net income to reconcile to core earnings represent our proportionate share of such items incurred by our unconsolidated joint ventures 
a reconciliation of our gaap net income attributable to common stockholders to core earnings is presented below 
table of contents year ended december  in thousands gaap net income attributable to common stockholders adjustments to gaap net income to reconcile to core earnings noncash equity compensation expense incentive fee depreciation expense net unrealized loss on derivatives core earnings inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance more so than inflation  although inflation rates can often have a meaningful influence over the direction of interest rates 
furthermore  our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our distributions are determined by our board of directors primarily based on our taxable income  and  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and credit risk in our underlying investments 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed  either directly or indirectly through its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  are credit risk  interest rate risk  credit curve spread risk and foreign currency risk 
credit risk our joint venture investments and loans receivable are subject to a high degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults 
default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  borrower financial condition  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the us economy  and other factors beyond our control 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
we manage credit risk through the underwriting process  acquiring our investments at the appropriate discount to face value  if any  and establishing loss assumptions 
we also carefully monitor the performance of the loans  including those held by the joint ventures  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
for more information  see business risk management 
interest rate and credit curve spread risk interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
credit curve spread risk is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the markets for commercial real estate loans and securities we hold 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
the majority of the performing loans held by our unconsolidated joint ventures are fixed rate loans 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the assets increases  the price at which the joint ventures could sell some of the assets may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the assets decreases  the value of the loan portfolios may increase 
in addition  fluctuations in libor rates may affect the amount of interest expense we incur in connection with borrowings under our credit facility  which  based on our current debt ratio  incur interest expense at a per annum rate equal to the sum of  at our election  the one  two  three  six  or twelve month libor plus 
as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings 
in october  one of our unconsolidated joint ventures obtained an interest rate swap to hedge against interest rate fluctuations 
we or our unconsolidated joint ventures may  in the future  utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for distribution and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses of rising interest rates 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  we are exposed to the risk 
table of contents that the counterparties with which we trade may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render us unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if we anticipate that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income purposes  we may conduct all or part of our hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
currency risk we have foreign currency rate exposures related to our equity investments in joint ventures which hold certain commercial real estate loan investments in europe 
our sole currency exposure is to the euro 
changes in currency rates can adversely affect the fair values and earnings of our non us holdings 
as of december   we had approximately million  or million  in european investments 
net tax effected accumulated foreign exchange loss on the european investments was approximately million  or million after hedge gain 
a change in the exchange rate would result in a million increase or decrease in translation gain or loss on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we mitigate this risk by utilizing currency instruments to hedge the capital portion of our foreign currency risk 
the type of hedging instrument that we employed on our european investments was a costless collar buying a protective put while writing an out of the money covered call with a strike price at which the premium received is equal to the premium of the protective put purchased which involved no initial capital outlay 
the puts were structured with strike prices approximately lower than our cost basis in such investments  thereby limiting any euro related foreign exchange related fluctuations to approximately of the original capital invested in the deal 
at december   we had six outstanding collars with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the maturity dates of such instruments approximate the projected dates of related cash flows for specific investments 
termination or maturity of currency hedging instruments may result in an obligation for payment to or from the counterparty to the hedging agreement 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by counterparties for these contracts 
to manage this risk  we select major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties and perform a quarterly review of the financial health and stability of our trading counterparties 
based on our review as of december   we do not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations 
the following table summarizes the notional amount and fair value of our collars as of december  in thousands  except exchange rates hedged asset notional amount cap range usd floor range usd expiration date net fair value investments in german loan portfolios july july
