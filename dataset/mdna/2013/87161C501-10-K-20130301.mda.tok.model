undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the fdic  are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval 
a depository institution holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of percent of the depository institution assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
deposit insurance and assessments deposits at our bank are insured by the dif as administered by the fdic  up to the applicable limits established by law 
the dodd frank act amended the statutory regime governing the dif 
among other things  the dodd frank act established a minimum drr of percent of estimated insured deposits  required that the fund reserve ratio reach percent by september  and directed the fdic to amend its regulations to redefine the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments 
specifically  the dodd frank act requires the assessment base to be an amount equal to the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution during the assessment period  minus the sum of the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period and an amount the fdic determines is necessary to establish assessments consistent with the risk based assessment system found in the federal deposit insurance act 
in december of  the fdic adopted a final rule setting the drr at percent 
furthermore  on february   the fdic issued a final rule changing its assessment system from one based on domestic deposits to one based on the average consolidated total assets of a bank minus its average tangible equity during each quarter 
the february  final rule modifies two adjustments added to the risk based pricing system in an unsecured debt adjustment and a brokered deposit adjustment  discontinues a third adjustment added in the secured liability adjustment  and adds an adjustment for long term debt held by an insured depository institution where the debt is issued by another insured depository institution 
under the february  final rule  the total base assessment rates will vary depending on the dif reserve ratio 
for example  for banks in the best risk category  the total base assessment rates will be between and basis points when the dif reserve ratio is below percent  between and basis points when the dif reserve ratio is between percent and percent  between and basis points when the dif reserve ratio is between percent and percent and between and basis points when the dif reserve ratio is percent or higher 
in addition  the fdic collects fico deposit assessments  which is calculated off of the new assessment base established by the dodd frank act 
fico assessments are set quarterly  and was 
annual basis points for all four quarters in synovus bank pays the deposit insurance assessment  less offset available by means of prepaid assessment credits  and pays the quarterly fico assessments 
notably  the dodd frank act provided temporary  unlimited deposit insurance for all noninterest bearing transaction accounts through december  however  as of january  when this provision of the dodd frank act expired  all of a depositor accounts at an insured depository institution  including all noninterest bearing transaction accounts  are insured by the fdic up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount  for each deposit insurance ownership category

risk factors regulation of the financial services industry continues to undergo major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position of this report 
on november   the fdic imposed a requirement on all financial institutions to prepay three years of fdic insurance premiums 
on december   synovus prepaid million of fdic insurance premiums for the next three years 
on december   synovus prepaid fdic insurance premiums totaled approximately million 
with respect to brokered deposits  an insured depository institution must be well capitalized in order to accept  renew or roll over such deposits without fdic clearance 
an adequately capitalized insured depository institution must obtain a waiver from the fdic in order to accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits 
undercapitalized insured depository institutions generally may not accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits

dodd frank act  future changes to legal framework on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which has and will continue to substantially change the regulatory framework under which we operate 
the dodd frank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry  addressing  among other things  systemic risk  capital adequacy  deposit insurance assessments  consumer financial protection  interchange fees  derivatives  lending limits  mortgage lending practices  registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies 
among the provisions that may affect the operations of synovus or synovus bank are the following creation of the cfpb with centralized authority  including examination and enforcement authority  for consumer protection in the banking industry 
new limitations on federal preemption 
new prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in  or relationships with  a hedge fund or private equity fund 
application of new regulatory capital requirements  including changes to leverage and risk based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital 
requirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies 
changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums 
permanently raising the fdic standard maximum insurance amount to repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits  effective july   thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
restrictions on compensation  including a prohibition on incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk by taking covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive  or that may lead to material losses 
requirement that sponsors of asset backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk underlying the securities 
requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness 
some of these and other major changes  such as the expiration of the unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts  which occurred on december   could materially impact the profitability of our business  the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans  require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs  taxes  liabilities  enforcement actions and reputational risk 
many of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the dodd frank act  while others are subject to further study  rule making  and the discretion of regulatory bodies 
for example  the dodd frank act contains provisions known as the volcker rule that are intended to restrict the ability of a bank to engage in proprietary trading that is viewed as risking the financial stability of the institution 
proprietary trading is defined in the dodd frank act to mean engaging as a principal for the trading account of a banking organization or supervised nonbank financial company in any transaction to purchase or sell  or otherwise acquire or dispose of any security  any derivative  any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery  any option on any such security  derivative  or contract  or any other security or financial instrument that the federal regulators may determine by regulation 
a proposal to implement these restrictions was issued in  however  the statutory deadline for issuing the final rule has passed 
it is anticipated that a final version of these rules will be issued in in light of these significant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators  we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the dodd frank act or any implementing regulations will have on synovus businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities 
additional regulations resulting from the dodd frank act may materially adversely affect synovus business  financial condition or results of operations 
see part item a 
risk factors regulation of the financial services 
table of contents industry is undergoing major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position of this report 
additional changes to the laws and regulations applicable to us are frequently proposed at both the federal and state levels 
the likelihood  timing  and scope of any such change and the impact any such change may have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty 
consumer protection regulations retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers  which are enforced at the federal level by the cfpb 
interest and other charges collected or contracted for by banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates 
loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions  such as the federal truth in lending act and regulation z  governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers  the home mortgage disclosure act and regulation c  requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves  the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race  creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit  the fair credit reporting act and regulation v  governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies  the fair debt collection act  governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies  and the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws 
deposit operations also are subject to the truth in savings act and regulation dd  which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers  regulation cc  which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers  the right to financial privacy act  which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records  and the electronic funds transfer act and regulation e  which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services  which the cfpb is in the process of expanding to include a new compliance regime that will govern electronic transfers initiated by consumers in the us to recipients in foreign countries 
rulemaking authority for these and other consumer financial protection laws transferred from the prudential regulators to the cfpb on july  it is anticipated that many of the foregoing consumer laws and regulations will change as a result of the dodd frank act and other developments 
for example  the cfpb recently issued rules that are likely to impact our residential mortgage lending practices  and the residential mortgage market generally  including rules that implement the ability to repay requirement and provide protection from liability for qualified mortgages  as required by the dodd frank act 
the ability to repay rule  which will take effect on january   requires lenders to consider  among other things  income  employment status  assets  employment  payment amounts  and credit history before approving a mortgage  and provides a compliance safe harbor for lenders that issue certain qualified mortgages 
the rules define a qualified mortgage to have certain specified characteristics  and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization  interest only payments  balloon payments  or terms exceeding years from being qualified mortgages 
the rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages  including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt to income ratio that is less than or equal to percent 
while qualified mortgages will generally be afforded safe harbor status  a rebuttable presumption of compliance will attach to mortgages that also meet the definition of a higher priced mortgage which are generally subprime loans 
as the definition of qualified mortgage provides either a safe harbor or a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability to repay requirement  the definition is expected to establish the parameters for the majority of consumer mortgage lending in the us reflecting the cfpb focus on the residential mortgage lending market  the cfpb also recently issued rules to implement requirements of the dodd frank act pertaining to mortgage loan origination including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications and has proposed  but not finalized  integrated mortgage disclosure rules that will replace and combine certain existing requirements under the truth in lending act and real estate settlement procedures act 
in addition  there are a number of significant consumer protection standards that apply to functional areas of operation rather than applying only to loan or deposit products 
for example  in june  the federal reserve issued a final rule establishing 
table of contents standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions 
the federal reserve and fdic also recently enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions 
the fdic has also issued rules aimed at protecting consumer in connection with retail foreign exchange transactions 
in recent years  the federal reserve and cfpb have made a number of changes to regulation e 
among these changes is the november amendment  which prohibits financial institutions  including synovus bank  from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one time debit card transactions  unless a consumer consents  or opts in  to the overdraft service for those types of transactions 
regulation e amendments also require financial institutions to provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial institution overdraft services  including the fees associated with the service and the consumer choices 
the amendments to regulation e became effective on august  in november  the fdic supplemented the regulation e amendments by requiring fdic supervised institutions  including synovus bank  to implement additional changes relating to automated overdraft payment programs by july  the most significant of these changes require financial institutions to monitor overdraft payment programs for excessive or chronic customer use and undertake meaningful and effective follow up action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than six times during a rolling month period 
the additional guidance also imposes daily limits on overdraft charges  requires institutions to review and modify check clearing procedures  prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and requires increased board and management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs 
the cfpb has also amended regulation e to establish rules for a new category of consumer initiated electronic transfers known as remittance transfers  which will require financial institutions to provide consumers that transfer funds to overseas recipients with detailed disclosures and to meet other requirements 
in addition  it is anticipated that the cfpb will engage in numerous other rulemakings in the near term that may impact our business  as the cfpb has indicated that  in addition to specific statutory mandates  it is working on a wide range of initiatives to address issues in markets for consumer financial products and services 
for example  the cfpb has recently requested comments regarding an effort to streamline consumer regulations 
and has established a database to collect  track and make public consumer complaints  including complaints against individual financial institutions 
we cannot predict the effect that being regulated by a new  additional regulatory authority focused on consumer financial protection  or any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that may result from the establishment of this new authority  will have on synovus businesses 
additional regulations resulting from the dodd frank act may materially adversely affect synovus business  financial condition or results of operations 
see part item a 
risk factors regulation of the financial services industry continues to undergo major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position of this report 
in addition  synovus bank may also be subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers 
anti money laundering  usa patriot act  office of foreign assets control financial institutions must maintain anti money laundering programs that include established internal policies  procedures  and controls  a designated compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and testing of the program by an independent audit function 
we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions 
recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 
anti money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the usa patriot act  enacted in and renewed in the usa patriot act amended  in part  the bank secrecy act and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering 
the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government  including requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering  requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with fincen for transactions exceeding  and mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations 
the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain  or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons 
the federal bureau of investigation may send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities 
our banks can be requested to search their records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists and may be required to report any identified relationships or transactions 
furthermore  ofac  is responsible for helping to ensure that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties  as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress 
ofac publishes  and routinely updates  lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding  harboring or engaging in terrorist acts  including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons 
if we find a name on any transaction  
table of contents account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list  we must freeze such account  file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 
bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti money laundering obligations and recently have been active in imposing cease and desist and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements 
in addition  fincen is in the process of establishing new regulations that would require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information for certain accounts  however  it has yet to establish final regulations on this topic 
commitments to synovus bank under the federal reserve board policy  we are expected to serve as a source of financial strength to synovus bank and to commit resources to support synovus bank in circumstances when we might not do so absent such policy 
under the bank holding company act  the federal reserve board may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary  other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank  upon the federal reserve board determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any depository institution subsidiary 
further  the federal reserve board has discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non bank subsidiaries if the agency determines that any such divestiture may aid the depository institution financial condition 
in addition  any loans by us to synovus bank would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the bank 
notably  the dodd frank act codified the federal reserve source of strength doctrine  this statutory change became effective july  in addition to the foregoing requirements  the dodd frank act new provisions authorize the federal reserve to require a company that directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its source of strength obligations and to enforce the company compliance with these obligations 
as of the date of this report  the federal reserve and other federal banking regulators have not yet issued rules implementing this requirement  though it is understood that regulators are engaged in a joint effort to produce these rules 
if we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the dodd frank act  any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of synovus bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the fdic  as appropriate  and entitled to a priority of payment 
in addition  the fdic provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of  or any assistance provided by the fdic to  a commonly controlled insured depository institution 
synovus bank is an fdic insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements 
transactions with affiliates and insiders a variety of legal limitations restrict synovus bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds or in some cases transacting business with us or synovus non bank subsidiaries 
synovus bank is subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulation w 
section a places limits on the amount of covered transactions  which include loans or extensions of credit to  investments in or certain other transactions with  affiliates as well as the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates 
the aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to percent of the bank capital and surplus for any one affiliate and percent for all affiliates 
furthermore  within the foregoing limitations as to amount  certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from to percent 
also  synovus bank is prohibited from purchasing low quality assets from any of its affiliates 
section of the dodd frank act broadens the definition of covered transaction to include derivative transactions and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate 
the expanded definition of covered transaction also includes the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a bank loan or extension of credit to a third party 
furthermore  reverse repurchase transactions will be viewed as extensions of credit instead of asset purchases and thus become subject to collateral requirements 
while final amendments to regulation w have not yet been adopted  the expanded definitions took effect on july  under the terms of the dodd frank act 
section b  among other things  prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
except for limitations on low quality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound  regulation w generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates 
transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits 
the federal reserve board also may designate bank subsidiaries as affiliates 
banks are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders  and their related interests 
in general  such extensions of credit may not exceed certain dollar limitations  must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
table of contents with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
certain extensions of credit also require the approval of a bank board of directors 
regulatory examinations federal and state banking agencies require us and our subsidiary bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures 
synovus bank  and in some cases we and our nonbank affiliates  must undergo regular on site examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency  which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities 
a bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution 
the results of the examination are confidential 
the cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate 
community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act requires the fdic to evaluate the record of synovus bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
these evaluations are considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions  and applications to open a branch or facility 
failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations on the bank 
commercial real estate lending lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators 
the regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations 
such loans generally include land development  construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property  and nonfarm  nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property 
the guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent percent or more of the institutions total capital  or total commercial real estate loans represent percent or more of the institution total capital  and the outstanding balance of the institution commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by percent or more during the prior months 
in october  the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance on commercial real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations 
in addition  the dodd frank act contains provisions that may impact our business by reducing the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increasing the cost of borrowing  including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets 
section of the dodd frank act requires  among other things  a loan originator or a securitizer of asset backed securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets 
the banking agencies have jointly issued a proposed rule to implement these requirements but have yet to issue final rules 
branching the dodd frank act substantially amended the legal framework that had previously governed interstate branching activities 
formerly  under the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  a bank ability to branch into a particular state was largely dependent upon whether the state opted in to de novo interstate branching 
many states did not opt in  which resulted in branching restrictions in those states 
the dodd frank act removed the opt in concept and permits banks to engage in de novo branching outside of their home states  provided that the laws of the target state permit banks chartered in that state to branch within that state 
accordingly  de novo interstate branching by synovus bank is subject to these new standards 
all branching in which synovus bank may engage remains subject to regulatory approval and adherence to applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
anti tying restrictions in general  a bank may not extend credit  lease  sell property  or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that the customer obtain or provide some additional credit  property  or services from or to the bank or bank holding company or their subsidiaries  or the customer not obtain some other credit  property  or services from a competitor  except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended 
a bank may  however  offer combined balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products 
also  certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule 

table of contents privacy and credit reporting financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential customer information 
customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties  with some exceptions  such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer 
financial institutions generally may not disclose certain consumer or account information to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing 
federal and state banking agencies have prescribed standards for maintaining the security and confidentiality of consumer information  and we are subject to such standards  as well as certain federal and state laws or standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach 
synovus bank utilizes credit bureau data in underwriting activities 
use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act and regulation v on a uniform  nationwide basis  including credit reporting  prescreening  and sharing of information between affiliates and the use of credit data 
the fair and accurate credit transactions act  which amended the fair credit reporting act  permits states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that act 
enforcement powers synovus bank and its institution affiliated parties  including management  employees  agents  independent contractors and consultants  such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution affairs  are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law  regulations or written orders of a government agency 
violations can include failure to timely file required reports  filing false or misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports 
civil penalties may be as high as  a day for such violations and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may include imprisonment for years 
regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution affiliated parties  and the fdic has the authority to terminate deposit insurance 
when issued by a banking agency  cease and desist and similar orders may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnifications or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets  rescind agreements or contracts  or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency 
the federal banking agencies also may remove a director or officer from an insured depository institution or bar them from the industry if a violation is willful or reckless 
we have entered into an mou with the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the georgia commissioner pursuant to which we have implemented plans that are intended to  among other things  minimize credit losses and reduce the amount of our distressed assets  limit and manage our concentrations in commercial real estate loans  improve our credit risk management and related policies and procedures  address liquidity management and current and future capital requirements  strengthen enterprise risk management practices  and provide for succession planning for key corporate and regional management positions 
additionally  synovus bank is presently subject to an mou with the georgia commissioner and the fdic that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the holding company memorandum of understanding described above and  as a result of recent compliance exams  synovus bank has entered into an informal written agreement with the fdic relating to certain compliance matters 
see part i item a 
risk factors we presently are subject to  and in the future may become subject to  supervisory actions and enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our business  reputation  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock of this report 
monetary policy and economic controls the earnings of synovus bank  and therefore our earnings  are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the monetary policy of the federal reserve board 
an important function of the federal reserve board is to promote orderly economic growth by influencing interest rates and the supply of money and credit 
among the methods that have been used to achieve this objective are open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate for bank borrowings  expanded access to funds for nonbanks and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments and deposits  interest rates on loans and securities  and rates paid for deposits 
recently  in response to the financial crisis  the federal reserve board has created several innovative programs to stabilize certain financial institutions and to ensure the availability of credit 
the effects of the various federal reserve board policies on our future business and earnings cannot be predicted 
we cannot predict the nature or extent of any effects that possible future governmental controls or legislation might have on our business and earnings 
depositor preference statute federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such institution  including federal funds and letters of credit  in the liquidation or other resolution of the institution by any receiver 

table of contents tarp regulations eesa and arra under the eesa  congress has the ability to impose after the fact terms and conditions on participants in the cpp 
as a participant in the cpp  we are subject to any such retroactive legislation 
on february   the treasury announced the financial stability plan which is intended to further stabilize financial institutions and stimulate lending across a broad range of economic sectors 
on february   president obama signed the arra  a broad economic stimulus package that included additional restrictions on  and potential additional regulation of  financial institutions 
on june   under the authority granted to it under arra and eesa  the treasury issued an interim final rule under section of eesa  as amended by arra  regarding compensation and corporate governance restrictions that would be imposed on tarp recipients  effective june  as a tarp recipient with currently outstanding tarp obligations  we are subject to the compensation and corporate governance restrictions and requirements set forth in the interim final rule  which  among other things prohibit us from paying or accruing bonuses  retention awards or incentive compensation  except for certain long term stock awards  to our senior executives and next most highly compensated employees  prohibit us from making severance payments to any of our senior executive officers or next five most highly compensated employees  require us to conduct semi annual risk assessments to assure that our compensation arrangements do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks or the manipulation of earnings to increase compensation  require us to recoup or clawback any bonus  retention award or incentive compensation paid by us to a senior executive officer or any of our next most highly compensated employees  if the payment was based on financial statements or other performance criteria that are later found to be materially inaccurate  prohibit us from providing tax gross ups to any of our senior executive officers or next most highly compensated employees  require us to provide enhanced disclosure of perquisites  and the use and role of compensation consultants  required us to adopt a corporate policy on luxury and excessive expenditures  require our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide period certifications about our compensation practices and compliance with the interim final rule  require us to provide enhanced disclosure of the relationship between our compensation plans and the risk posed by those plans  and require us to provide an annual non binding shareholder vote  or say on pay proposal  to approve the compensation of our executives  consistent with regulations promulgated by the sec 
on january   the sec adopted final regulations setting forth the parameters for such say on pay proposals for public company tarp participants 
notably  the dodd frank act contains separate requirements relating to compensation arrangements 
specifically  the act requires banking regulators to issue regulations or guidelines to prohibit incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing excessive compensation or that may lead to material loss at certain financial institutions with billion or more in assets 
a proposed rule was published in the federal register on april   however  regulators have yet to issue final rules on the topic 
additional regulations applicable to tarp recipients adopted as part of eesa  the financial stability plan  arra  or other legislation may subject us to additional regulatory requirements 
the impact of these additional requirements may put us at competitive disadvantage in comparison to financial institutions that have either repaid all tarp funds or never accepted tarp funds and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
capital purchase program on october   the us treasury  or treasury  announced that  pursuant to the eesa  it was implementing a voluntary program known as the capital purchase program  or cpp  pursuant to which eligible financial institutions could raise capital by selling preferred stock directly to the us government 
the purpose of the capital purchase program was to encourage us financial institutions to build capital to  among other things  increase the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers and support the us economy  and was also intended to prevent additional failures of financial institutions 
synovus applied for the maximum investment available under the cpp equal to of risk weighted assets  noting that this additional capital would be used to provide strength against worse than expected economic conditions  more flexibility in disposing of distressed assets to strengthen our balance sheet  capacity to invest in our local economies through lending  ability to work with homeowners in mortgage workouts  and participation in government directed acquisitions of banks or assets  and  as permitted  opportunistic acquisition transactions 
our application to participate in the cpp was approved by treasury on november  on december   synovus consummated the cpp investment and issued to treasury  shares of synovus series a preferred stock having a liquidation amount per share equal to  for a total price of  the series a preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per year 
synovus has timely paid all dividends on the series a preferred stock 
we may  at our option and with the consent of the fdic  redeem  in whole or in part  the series a preferred stock at the liquidation amount per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series a preferred stock is generally non voting 
however  if we fail to pay dividends on the series a preferred stock for an aggregate of six quarterly periods  whether or not consecutive  our number of authorized directors shall be increased by two and the holders of the series a preferred stock shall have the right to elect two directors 
in addition  the consent of the holders of of the series a preferred stock is required to authorize or create any stock ranking senior to the series a preferred stock  for any 
table of contents amendment to our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the rights or preferences of the holders of the series a preferred stock and for consummation of certain business combinations

item a 
risk factors this section highlights the material risks that we currently face 
please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future 
new risks may emerge at any time  and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our securities 

table of contents the deterioration in the residential construction and development and land acquisition portfolio may lead to increased non performing assets in our loan portfolio and increased provision for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
the residential construction and development and land acquisition real estate portfolio continues to experience a variety of difficulties and challenging economic conditions  which continues to put pressure on our commercial real estate loan portfolio and has contributed to elevated non performing assets in the residential construction and development and land acquisition portfolio 
during the recent credit crisis  our residential construction and development and land acquisition portfolio experienced a higher level of npls and losses than any other loan category in our loan portfolio 
from through  this portfolio had billion in losses  which was approximately of all losses during this period of time 
see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit quality non performing assets in this report 
while recent economic data suggests that overall economic conditions are improving  if market conditions in the residential construction and development and land acquisition real estate markets remain poor or further deteriorate  they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on our loans and real estate owned in these markets as we continue to reassess the fair value of our non performing assets  the loss severities of loans in default  and the fair value of real estate owned 
furthermore  a sustained weak economy could result in a continuation of the decreased demand for residential housing  which  in turn  could adversely affect the development and construction efforts of residential real estate developers  adversely affect the ability of residential real estate developer borrowers to repay these loans and the value of property used as collateral for such loans  result in higher levels of non performing loans in other categories  such as commercial and industrial loans  which may result in additional losses  and lead to an inability to grow quality loans in this loan portfolio  which may harm our future operating results 
management continually monitors market conditions and economic factors throughout our footprint for indications of change in other markets 
if these economic conditions and market factors negatively and or disproportionately affect some of our larger loans  then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge offs and also be required to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses 
any further increase in our non performing assets and related increases in our provision for loan losses could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses  and we may be required to materially increase our allowance  which may adversely affect our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses  which represents management best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans  as described under note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report and under critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses under part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans  risk ratings  and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
because the risk rating of the loans is inherently subjective and subject to changes in the borrower credit risk profile  evolving local market conditions and other factors  it can be difficult for us to predict the effects that those factors will have on the classifications assigned to the loan portfolio  and thus difficult to anticipate the velocity or volume of the migration of loans through the classification process and effect on the level of the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  we monitor our credit quality and our reserve requirements and use that as a basis for capital planning and other purposes 
see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources of this report for further information 
in light of current market conditions  we regularly reassess the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans at december   compared to million  or of total loans at december  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic assumptions as well as changes in assumptions regarding a borrower ability to pay and or collateral values 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review the allowance 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require synovus to recognize additions to the allowance or additional loan charge offs 
an increase in the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease in net income and capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
we recorded a provision for loan losses for the year ended december  of million compared to a million provision for loan losses for the year ended december   both of which are significantly higher than historical levels 
we also charged off approximately million in loans  net of recoveries  during the year ended december   compared 
table of contents to million in loans  net of recoveries  during the year ended december  while the provision for loan losses was lower in and than the provision for loan losses in and  the provision for loan losses remains higher than historical levels 
even though our credit trends showed significant improvement during and compared to the prior two years  our non performing assets and credit costs remain elevated 
while we expect that our levels of non performing assets and credit costs will continue to decline during  we also expect that these levels of non performing assets will remain at elevated levels compared to historical levels for the next two years due to the continuing weak economic conditions  particularly in the commercial and residential real estate sector  as the deterioration in the credit and real estate markets causes borrowers to default 
further  the value of the collateral underlying a given loan  and the realizable value of such collateral in a foreclosure sale  likely will be negatively affected by the sustained downturn in the real estate market  and therefore may result in an inability to realize a full recovery in the event that a borrower defaults on a loan 
any additional non performing assets  loan charge offs  increases in the provision for loan losses or any inability by us to realize the full value of underlying collateral in the event of a loan default  could negatively affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations and the price of our securities 
we will realize additional future losses if our levels of non performing assets increase and or if we determine to sell certain non performing assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets 
in  we announced a strategy to aggressively dispose of distressed assets 
during the four year period from january  through december   we disposed of approximately billion of distressed assets  including the sale of distressed assets with a total carrying value of approximately million during as a part of our overall continued efforts to reduce distressed assets  we expect that we will continue our sales of distressed assets during and future periods 
the actual volume of our future distressed asset sales  if any  will vary during any particular period  depending upon a variety of factors  including an increase in the rate of migration of our loans from performing status to distressed status  an increase in the overall level of distressed loans at any given point in time  opportunities to sell such assets on a favorable basis  and further regulatory developments or directives to reduce our level of distressed assets 
we will realize additional future losses if the proceeds we receive upon dispositions of assets are less than the recorded carrying value of such assets  which could adversely  affect our results of operations in future periods 
accordingly  we will realize an increased level of credit costs  and possibly losses  in any period during which we determine to dispose of an increased level of distressed assets 
further  the continuing weakness in the residential and commercial real estate markets may negatively impact our ability to dispose of distressed assets  and may result in higher credit losses on sales of distressed assets 
we may not realize the expected benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives  which will negatively impact our future profitability 
in the current competitive banking environment  synovus must continue to reduce operating costs and implement strategies to grow its loan portfolio and increase non interest income in order to realize sustained future profitability and to remain competitive with the other banks in the markets we serve 
since  we have implemented a series of strategic efficiency and growth initiatives to address the challenges facing synovus and defined strategies for expense reduction  streamlining of processes and long term growth initiatives 
in  through the execution of these initiatives  synovus realized a million  or  reduction in total non interest expense  and a million or reduction in core expenses 
in  we reduced total non interest expense by million  or  compared to  and reduced core expenses by million  or  from see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non gaap financial measures of this report for further information 
in  through the execution of these initiatives  synovus realized a million  or  reduction in total non interest expense  and a million or reduction in core expenses 
in  we reduced total non interest expense by million  or  compared to see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non gaap financial measures of this report for further information 
management has also identified new expense savings initiatives of approximately million to be implemented during in addition to efficiency initiatives  management continues to identify and implement initiatives to grow our loan portfolio and our non interest income  including investing in additional expertise  product offerings  and product quality in synovus commercial and industrial lending group and developing new products and services to grow new fee income 
however  there can be no assurance that synovus will ultimately realize the anticipated benefits of its expense reduction and growth strategies 
in addition  synovus is subject to various risks inherent in its business 
these risks may cause the anticipated results from our growth strategies and cost reduction initiatives to result in implementation charges beyond those currently contemplated or could result in some other unanticipated adverse impact 
furthermore  if we do not realize the anticipated cost savings from our efficiency initiatives  we may need to take additional actions including branch closures and headcount reductions to achieve the desired cost savings 
the implementation of these initiatives may also have unintended impacts on synovus ability to attract and retain business and customers 
accordingly  we cannot guarantee that the anticipated long term benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives will be realized and if they are not we may not achieve our strategic and financial objectives 

table of contents if economic conditions worsen or regulatory capital rules are modified  we may be required to undertake additional strategic initiatives to improve our capital position 
during and  synovus executed a number of strategic capital initiatives to bolster our capital position against credit deterioration and to provide additional capital as synovus pursued its aggressive asset disposition strategy 
as of december   synovus tier capital ratio was  its tier common equity ratio was  and synovus and synovus bank were considered well capitalized under current regulatory standards 
see part i item business supervision  regulation and other factors prompt corrective action of this report for further information 
this regulatory capital framework is expected to change in important respects as a result of the dodd frank act and a separate  international regulatory capital initiative known as basel iii 
in particular  the dodd frank act eliminates tier capital treatment for most trust preferred securities after a three year phase in period that begins january  furthermore  in december  bcbs finalized new regulatory capital standards  known as basel iii  which are aimed at capital reform  seek to further strengthen financial institutions capital positions by mandating a higher minimum level of common equity to be held  along with a capital conservation buffer to withstand future periods of stress 
at present  our tier common equity is in excess of the minimum common equity and additional conservation buffer stipulated by these newly proposed requirements 
regardless  complying with these new capital requirements will likely affect our operations  and the extent to which we will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional clarity is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements 
these new requirements have been endorsed by the us banking regulators  but have not yet been translated by the regulators into official regulation for us financial institutions 
it was anticipated that us regulators would adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the bcbs to be phased in for us financial institutions beginning in in june of  us banking regulators proposed new standards to implement these capital requirements 
however  on november   regulators announced that the implementation of these rules would be delayed and did not provide a specific timeframe for their implementation 
while the timing of these new capital requirements is uncertain  it is widely anticipated that the new capital requirements for most bank and financial holding companies  as well as for most insured depository institutions  will increase  although the nature and amounts of the increase have not yet been specified 
in addition  reflecting the importance that regulators place on managing capital and other risks  on june   the banking agencies issued proposed guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more than billion in total consolidated assets 
this guidance  which was finalized on may   outlines four high level principles for stress testing practices that should be a part of a banking organization stress testing framework 
specifically  the guidance calls for the framework to include activities and exercises that are tailored to and sufficiently capture the banking organization exposures  activities and risks  employ multiple conceptually sound stress testing activities and approaches  be forward looking and flexible  and be clear  actionable  well supported  and used in the decision making process 
moreover  the federal bank regulators have issued a series of guidance and rulemakings applicable to large banks 
while many of these do not currently apply to us due to our asset size  these issuances could impact industry capital standards and practices in many  potentially unforeseeable ways 
we are also subject to new stress testing requirements that implement provisions of the dodd frank act and that are designed to require banking organizations to assess the potential impact of different scenarios on their earnings  losses  and capital over a set time period  with consideration given to certain relevant factors  including the organization condition  risks  exposures  strategies  and activities 
these rules require banking organizations with total consolidated assets of more than billion but less than billion to conduct annual company run stress tests  report the results to their primary federal regulator and the federal reserve board  and publish a summary of the results 
under the rules  stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios that the board will publish by november of each year 
these new rules require a banking organization with between and billion in assets to conduct its first stress test using financial statement data as of september   and to report the results by march  in addition  the rules will require such organizations to begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress test results in with respect to the stress test conducted in the fall of this public disclosure of these stress tests could result in reputational harm if our results are worse than those of our competitors 
synovus continues to actively monitor economic conditions  evolving industry capital standards  and changes in regulatory standards and requirements  and engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at both synovus and synovus bank 
as part of its ongoing management of capital  synovus will continue to identify  consider  and pursue additional strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary  including strategies in connection with the company repayment of tarp and strategies that may be required to meet the requirements of basel iii and other regulatory initiatives regarding capital 
if economic conditions or other factors worsen to a materially greater degree than the assumptions underlying management current internal assessment of our capital position or if minimum regulatory capital requirements for us or synovus bank increase as the result of legislative changes or informal or formal regulatory directives  then we would be required to pursue one or more additional capital improvement strategies  including  among others  balance sheet optimization strategies  asset sales  and or the sale of securities to one or more third parties 
there can be no assurance that any such transactions will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  or that we would be able to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions 
we also cannot predict the effect that these transactions would have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  if we issue additional equity securities in these transactions  including options  warrants  preferred stock or convertible securities  such newly issued securities could cause significant dilution to the holders of our common stock 

table of contents our net interest income could be negatively affected by the lower level of short term interest rates and a decrease in total loans 
net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on interest bearing liabilities  is a major component of our income 
our net interest income is our primary source of revenue from our operations 
interest rates during through have remained within the range of to as set by the federal reserve during a significant portion of our loans  including commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans  bear interest at variable rates 
in addition  in order to compete for deposits in our primary market areas  we may offer more attractive interest rates to depositors  or we may have to pursue other sources of liquidity  such as wholesale funds 
our total loans decreased to billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  a decrease in loans outstanding and lower realized yields on investment securities reduced our net interest income during the year ended december  and could cause additional pressure on net interest income in future periods 
this reduction in net interest income also may be exacerbated by the high level of competition that we face in our primary market area 
any significant reduction in our net interest income could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse impact on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market  or the way in which we are perceived in such markets  may adversely affect our capital resources  liquidity and financial results 
we may be unable to access historical and alternative sources of liquidity  including the capital markets  brokered deposits and borrowings from the fhlb  which could adversely affect our overall liquidity 
liquidity represents the extent to which we have readily available sources of funding needed to meet the needs of our depositors  borrowers and creditors  to support asset growth  and to otherwise sustain our operations and the operations of our subsidiary bank 
in managing our consolidated balance sheet  we depend on access to a variety of sources of funding to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs  and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our customers 
sources of funding available to us  and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity and funding management strategy  include borrowings from the fhlb and brokered deposits 
see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources of this report for further information 
we also have historically enjoyed a solid reputation in the capital markets and have been able to raise funds in the form of either short or long term borrowings or equity issuances 
if  due to market disruptions  perceptions about our credit ratings or other factors  we are unable to access the capital markets in the future  our capital resources and liquidity may be adversely affected 
in general  the amount  type and cost of our funding  including from other financial institutions  the capital markets and deposits  directly impacts our costs in operating our business and growing our assets and therefore  can positively or negatively affect our financial results 
a number of factors could make funding more difficult  more expensive or unavailable on any terms  including  but not limited to  further reductions in our debt ratings  financial results and losses  changes within our organization  specific events that adversely impact our reputation  disruptions in the capital markets  specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry  counterparty availability  changes affecting our assets  the corporate and regulatory structure  interest rate fluctuations  general economic conditions and the legal  regulatory  accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions 
also  we compete for funding with other banks and similar companies  many of which are substantially larger  and have more capital and other resources than we do 
in addition  as some of these competitors consolidate with other financial institutions  these advantages may increase 
competition from these institutions may increase the cost of funds 
for synovus bank  the primary source of liquidity is the growth and retention of deposits 
in the current competitive environment  customer confidence is a critical element in growing and retaining deposits 
in this regard  synovus bank asset quality could play a larger role in the stability of the deposit base 
in the event asset quality declines significantly from its current level or is perceived to be less than that of our competitors  synovus bank ability to grow and retain deposits could be diminished 
we must also maintain adequate liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs  including the servicing of debt  the payment of general corporate expenses  and the payment of dividends on our common stock and series a preferred stock 
see part i item a 
risk factors we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and repay maturing debt obligations of this report 
the primary source of liquidity at the holding company level is dividends from synovus bank 
during and  synovus did not receive any dividends from synovus bank 
synovus bank is currently subject to a mou that prohibits it from paying any cash dividends to us without regulatory approval  and other ga dbf rules and related statutes contain additional restrictions on payments of dividends by synovus bank 
see part i item business supervision  regulatory and other factors dividends of this report for further information 
synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors  including  without limitation  synovus bank future profits  asset quality and overall financial condition 
synovus expects that it will receive dividends from synovus bank in if synovus does not receive dividends from synovus bank in  its liquidity could be adversely affected 
in particular  failure to receive dividends from synovus bank will impair synovus ability to repay tarp in full without issuing substantially more debt or equity than it otherwise anticipates will be required 
in addition to dividends from synovus bank  we have historically had access to a 
table of contents number of alternative sources of liquidity  including the capital markets  but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
if our access to these traditional and alternative sources of liquidity is diminished or only available on unfavorable terms  then our overall liquidity and financial condition will be adversely affected 
our status as a non investment grade issuer and any further reductions in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets and impact our liquidity 
during the past three years  our long term debt has been downgraded to below investment grade by moody investors service  standard and poor ratings services and fitch ratings 
the ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and synovus bank  and their ratings of our long term debt are based on a number of factors  including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control  including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 
in light of the continuing difficulties in the financial services industry and the housing and financial markets  there can be no assurance that we will not receive further reductions in our ratings  which could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and the way in which we are perceived in the capital markets 
actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings  including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade  could affect the market value and liquidity of our outstanding public indebtedness and increase our borrowing costs 
we cannot predict whether existing customer relationships or opportunities for future relationships could be further affected by customers who choose to do business with a higher rated institution 
see part i item a 
risk factors changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market  or the way in which we are perceived in such markets  may adversely affect our capital resources  liquidity and financial results of this report 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and repay maturing debt obligations 
as of december   synovus and its consolidated subsidiaries had billion of long term debt outstanding 
in addition  approximately million of our existing subordinated notes will mature on february   and approximately million of our junior subordinated notes that are a component of the tmeds will mature on may  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to satisfy our obligations in respect of our debt  to refinance our debt or to fund capital expenditures will depend on our future financial and operating performance and our ability to maintain adequate liquidity 
prevailing economic conditions including interest rates  regulatory constraints  including  among other things  on distributions to us from our subsidiaries and required capital levels with respect to certain of our banking and insurance subsidiaries  and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  will also affect our ability to meet these needs 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or obtain future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt when needed on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations  we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in our business  sell assets  seek to obtain additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt on terms that may not be favorable to us 
while we recently reversed the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  we may not be able to realize these assets in the future and they may be subject to additional valuation allowances  which could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios 
during  synovus established a valuation allowance for substantially all of its deferred tax assets  primarily due to the realization of significant losses  significant credit deterioration  and negative trending in asset quality and uncertainty regarding the amount of future taxable income that synovus could forecast 
management assesses the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets at each reporting period 
the determination of whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate is subject to considerable judgment and requires an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence 
at december   synovus was in a three year cumulative loss position  which represents negative evidence 
however  based on the weight of all the positive and negative evidence at december   management concluded that it was more likely than not that million of the net deferred tax assets will be realized based upon future taxable income and therefore  reversed million of the valuation allowance at december  
the valuation allowance of million at december  is related to specific state income tax credits and specific state nol carryforwards that have various expiration dates through the tax year and  respectively and are expected to expire before they can be utilized 
as of december   approximately million of synovus deferred tax assets were disallowed when calculating regulatory capital 
applicable banking regulations permit us to include these deferred tax assets  up to a maximum amount  when calculating synovus regulatory capital to the extent these assets will be realized based on future projected earnings within one year of the report date 
the valuation allowance could fluctuate in future periods based on the assessment of the positive and negative evidence 
management conclusion at december  that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset of million will be realized is based upon management estimate of future taxable income 
management estimate of future taxable income is based on internal projections which consider historical performance  various internal estimates and assumptions  as well as certain external data  all of which management believes to be reasonable although inherently subject to significant judgment 
if 
table of contents actual results differ significantly from the current estimates of future taxable income  even if caused by adverse macro economic conditions  the valuation allowance may need to be increased for some or all of synovus deferred tax asset 
such an increase to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
