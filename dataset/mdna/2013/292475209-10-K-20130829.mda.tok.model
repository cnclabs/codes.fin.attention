ncp primarily consists of standup hbas  mezzanine cards  i o asics  loms  and ucnas 
within ncp  fibre channel based product revenues  which accounted for approximately and of total ncp revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  decreased by approximately primarily due to a decrease in average selling price of approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal ethernet based product revenues also decreased by approximately primarily due to a decrease in units shipped of approximately  arising principally from lower customer demand for gb lom products as customers consumed residual inventory purchased in fiscal  as well as the impact of the permanent injunction 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in average selling price of approximately due to a change in product mix 
the decrease in ncp revenues was partially offset by the increase in embedded i o based product revenue of primarily due to an increase in units shipped of approximately  partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of approximately 
we expect the weakness in ncp to continue for at least the first half of fiscal when redesigned asics are expected to become available for shipments to current and new prospective customers 
scp primarily consists of our inspeed  soc and backend connectivity  bridge  and router products 
our scp revenues decreased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decline in backend connectivity product shipments due to last time buys of certain products reaching end of life during fiscal we expect our scp revenue to modestly decline further in fiscal  and primarily relate to bridging products 
atp primarily consists of our ibmcs  which are products previously sold by serverengines prior to our acquisition on august   certain legacy products and other products and services 
for fiscal  our ibmc based products accounted for the majority of total atp revenues 
the decrease in our atp revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in units shipped of approximately combined with a decrease in average selling price of approximately 
the visibility segment resulted from our acquisition of endace on february  and consists solely of nvp 
nvp revenues in fiscal were approximately million during the four months since the acquisition date compared to no revenues in fiscal  and include network visibility and intelligent network recording products 
revenues from nvp systems and dag cards accounted for approximately and  respectively  in fiscal nvp revenues will increase in fiscal as we realize a full year of revenues following the acquisition 
net revenues by major customers in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchase or market products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
if these indirect sales are purchases of customer specific models  we are able to track these sales 
however  if these indirect sales are purchases of our standard models  we are not able to distinguish them by oem customer 
customers whose direct net revenues  or total direct and indirect net revenues including customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers and other third parties  exceeded of our fiscal year net revenues were as follows net revenues by major customers direct revenues total direct and indirect revenues net revenue percentage oem emc hewlett packard hon hai precision industry co  ltd

is a contract manufacturer that performed manufacturing for some of our oem customers 
direct sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately and of total net revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
direct and indirect sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately of total net revenues for both fiscal years and our net revenues from customers can be significantly impacted by changes to our customers business and their business models 
net revenues by sales channel net revenues by sales channel were as follows net revenues by sales channel percentage of net revenues percentage of net revenues increase decrease percentage change dollars in thousands oem distribution end users and other   nm total net revenues the decrease in oem net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal reflected a decrease of approximately in atp revenues and a decrease of approximately in scp revenues 
the increase in distribution net revenues during compared to fiscal was primarily due to nvp net revenues generated through distribution partners  partially offset by a decrease of approximately in ncp net revenues generated through distribution partners 
the increase in end users and other net revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to nvp net revenues generated from end users 
we believe that a majority of our net revenues are driven by product certifications and qualifications with our oem customers  which take products directly and indirectly through distribution and contract manufacturers 
we view product certifications and qualifications as an important indicator of future revenue opportunities and growth for the company 
however  product certifications and qualifications do not necessarily ensure continued market acceptance of our products by our oem customers 
it is also very difficult to determine the future impact  if any  of product certifications and qualifications on our revenues 
net revenues by geographic territory our net revenues by geographic territory based on billed to location were as follows net revenues by geographic territory percentage of net revenues percentage of net revenues increase decrease percentage change dollars in thousands asia pacific united states europe  middle east  and africa rest of the world    nm total net revenues we believe the decrease in the percentage of revenue in the united states and europe  middle east and africa continues to be driven by the continuing migration of our oem customers production to contract manufacturers predominately located in asia pacific 
we expect this trend to continue 
however  since we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations

approximately million and million of share based compensation expense and approximately million and million of amortization of technology intangible assets were included in cost of sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately million of amortization of technology intangible assets in fiscal related to endace 
the increase in our gross profit was primarily due to the non recurrence of certain one time expenses incurred during fiscal that are discussed further below 
during fiscal  we recorded sunset period royalty and patent license fee amortization expenses of million related to the settlement agreement entered into with broadcom on july  compared to million in fiscal the million was comprised of million patent litigation settlement expense  million patent litigation damages and million of sunset royalty expense 
during fiscal  we also incurred approximately million of additional expedite and freight charges in connection with our activities to mitigate the impact of the october flooding in thailand that affected one of our contract manufacturers 
the additional expenses in fiscal were partially offset by higher volume and favorable product mix during each year 
we will continue to recognize license fee amortization related to the settlement agreement entered into with broadcom on july   over the remaining nine year patent license term and increased royalty expense related to the amended injunction during fiscal we also expect the trend toward increased sales of lower margin products to continue in the future 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development  and support of our products

approximately million of the increase in salary and related expenses and of the increased headcount were associated with the endace acquisition 
also included in the increase in salary and related expenses was million of severance costs 
the year over year increase was partially offset by a decrease in outside services and consulting of approximately million as well as lower tool and software license costs resulting from optimized usage and improved pricing

our income tax provision for fiscal and fiscal was as follows dollars in thousands income taxes percentage of net revenues percentage of net revenues increase decrease percentage points change our effective tax expense benefit rate was approximately and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the change in our effective tax expense rate for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the continuing impact of our previously recorded us deferred tax asset valuation allowance  the impact of our fiscal us losses that will be carried back to prior tax years  and changes in the mix of earnings in international versus us tax jurisdictions 
we continue to generate the majority of our taxable earnings in countries other than the us  including india  ireland  and isle of man  where such earnings are generally subject to significantly lower tax rates than the us we expect this trend to continue in the future 
we have made no provision for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the us as a result of the global scope of our operations and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations  the tax liabilities in each of the countries in which we operate may differ materially from our estimates and impact our expected tax rate in the future 
in addition  our future effective tax rate may be impacted by other items including newly enacted tax legislation  stock based compensation  uncertain tax positions and examinations by various tax authorities

we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties 
changes in judgments and uncertainties relating to these estimates could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that are the most significant for purposes of fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
the majority of our product sales are made to oem customers 
we generally recognize revenue for product sales at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we also maintain sales related reserves for our sales incentive programs 
based on the specific program criteria  we classify the costs of these incentive programs as a reduction of revenue  a cost of sale  or an operating expense 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels using selected distributors and master value added resellers collectively  distributors 
these distributors are subject to distribution agreements that may be terminated upon written notice by either party  and that generally provide privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs that limit our ability to reasonably estimate product returns and the final price of inventory sold to distributors 
accordingly  we recognize revenue on our standard non oem specific products sold to our distributors based on a sell through model 
oem specific models sold to our distributors are generally governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements  accordingly  we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment for oem specific products shipped to our distributors 
we also enter into certain sales transactions  referred to as multiple element arrangements  which generally include the sale of hardware with standalone value that includes embedded software that is essential to the functionality of such hardware  and related maintenance services for a period of one to three years 
these sale arrangements do not include return rights or contingent payment terms 
the company uses the following hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to each deliverable i vendor specific evidence vsoe of fair value  if available  ii third party evidence tpe of selling price if vsoe is not available  and iii best estimate of the selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
besps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
the company utilizes besp as vsoe and tpe was determined not to exist for its deliverables in these arrangements 
the company s process for determining its besps considers multiple factors including prices charged by the company for similar offerings  historical pricing practices  and product specific profit objectives 
such factors can impact the timing and amount of revenues and net income recognized over the term of the contract 
consideration allocated to the equipment is recognized in accordance with our general revenue recognition criteria for product sales discussed above 
consideration allocated to the maintenance element is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance agreement 
amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs and management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management believes that collectability of the amount is unlikely 
although we have not historically experienced significant losses on accounts receivable  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we use a standard cost system to determine cost 
the standard costs are adjusted periodically to represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure that the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to reduce the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 
intangible assets and other long lived assets 
intangible assets resulting from acquisitions or licensing agreements are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges  if any 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from one to twelve years 
acquired in process research and development ipr d is recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts or impairment 
ipr d projects relate to in process projects that have not reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and have no alternative future use 
upon completion of development  acquired in process research and development assets are transferred to finite lived intangible assets and amortized over their useful lives 
we assess whether our intangible assets and other long lived assets should be tested for recoverability periodically and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
goodwill 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead  is tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
in assessing goodwill impairment for each of its reporting units  we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that the fair value of such reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the company s qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill considers various macro economic  industry specific and company specific factors 
these factors include i severe adverse industry or economic trends  ii significant company specific actions  including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected deterioration of the company s financial performance  or iv a sustained decrease in the company s market capitalization below its net book value 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is unlikely that the fair value of such reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if we conclude otherwise  then we are required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired  otherwise  goodwill is considered impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we also have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
we may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
fair value of our reporting units is determined using a combination of the market approach and income approach  unless the reporting unit was recently acquired such that the fair value approximates the purchase price 
under the market approach  fair value is based on peer multiples  which requires judgment regarding the selection of comparable companies 
under the income approach  fair value is dependent on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the material assumptions used in performing the discounted cash flow analysis include forecasts of expected future cash flows  including elements such as revenues  cost of sales  operating expenses  tax expenses  working capital  investment and capital expenditures 
key assumptions also include expected near and long term growth rates  as well as expected profitability levels and capital investment 
since the forecasted cash flows of the business need to be discounted to present value in order to arrive at estimates of fair value  discount rates must also be estimated and applied in the valuation models 
these discount rates are based on estimates of a market weighted average cost of capital for the reporting 
the annual impairment test is performed during the fourth fiscal quarter 
our recent impairment test indicated that our networking reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value 
since our visibility reporting unit was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  we evaluated the qualitative factors since the date of acquisition and concluded that it is unlikely that the fair value of this reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  and accordingly  the two step impairment test was not conducted for this reporting unit 
as part of our annual test  we also consider our recent market capitalization levels and compare aggregate fair value of our reporting units to the fair value of the company as a whole  primarily based on our market capitalization 
although our annual test resulted in no impairment  given the recent volatility of our market capitalization  it is reasonably possible that our goodwill could become impaired in the near term 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets  net  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k for additional information 
acquisitions purchase price allocation 
we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including identifiable intangible assets  based on their respective fair value as the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying acquired net tangible and intangibles assets  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized in the first reporting period that it becomes more likely than not such tax position will be sustained upon examination 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not recognition threshold is recorded at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period are derecognized in that period 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
we record potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded against any deferred tax assets when  in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that all of or part of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including recent financial performance  scheduled reversals of temporary differences  projected future taxable income  availability of taxable income in carryback periods and tax planning strategies 
based on a review of such information  we believe that insufficient positive evidence exists to support that we will more likely than not be able to realize the majority of our us federal and state deferred tax assets 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent that they are not expected to be recoverable against taxes previously paid in available carryback periods 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method 
although we grant unvested stock awards  cash settled stock unit awards and stock options  the majority of the awards granted and stock based compensation recognized consists of unvested stock awards 
the fair value of each unvested stock award is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date 
the fair value of each cash settled unit award is determined based on the closing price of our common stock upon vesting  and therefore  is subject to remeasurement at each reporting period until the award is vested 
for stock options  the fair value of each option is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors including principally stock price volatility and  to a lesser extent  expected term  dividend rate  and risk free interest rate 
the input factors used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting tranche of the award 
a forfeiture rate assumption is applied in determining the fair value of our stock based compensation related to both unvested stock awards and stock options based on future expectations and may be revised as significant differences become known 
in addition  a probability assessment is applied to unvested performance based stock awards 
these adjustments may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
litigation costs and contingencies 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency or litigation settlement when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of whether a loss contingency or litigation settlement is probable or reasonably possible involves a significant amount of management judgment  as does the estimation of the range of loss given the nature of contingencies 
liabilities related to litigation settlements with multiple elements are recorded based on the fair value of each element 
legal and other litigation related costs are recognized as the services are provided 
we record insurance and other indemnity recoveries for litigation costs when both of the following conditions are met i the recovery is probable and ii collectability is reasonably assured 
the insurance recoveries recorded are only to the extent the litigation costs have been incurred and recognized in the financial statements  however  it is reasonably possible that the actual recovery may be significantly different from our estimates 
there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot provide assurance that any actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation or substantial settlement charges 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity consist of our existing cash balances and investments  as well as funds expected to be generated from operations 
at june   we had approximately million in working capital and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and current investments  as compared to approximately million in working capital and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and current investments at july  we have historically maintained an investment portfolio of various security holdings  types  and maturities that meet credit quality standards in accordance with our investment guidelines 
we limit our exposure to any one issuer or type of investment with the exception of us government issued or us government sponsored entity securities 
our investments portfolio balance was zero at june  as of july   our investments primarily consisted of marketable certificates of deposits and fixed income securities 
we did not hold any auction rate securities or direct investments in mortgage backed securities as of june  or july  our cash balances and investments are held in numerous locations throughout the world 
as of june   our international subsidiaries held approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  which will be used to repay obligations to us affiliate entities that arise in the normal course of business and would not result in incremental us tax liabilities when paid 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for fiscal years and in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal the decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a payment of million related to the settlement agreement entered into with broadcom on july   of which approximately million was accrued during fiscal see note  commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption  litigation included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k 
the broadcom payment was partially offset by income tax refunds received of approximately million less income taxes paid of approximately million 
the current period cash provided by operating activities resulted from net loss of approximately million  non cash adjustments for amortization of intangible assets of approximately million  share based compensation expense of approximately million  and depreciation and amortization of approximately million  and changes in operating assets and liabilities including a decrease in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and other liabilities of approximately million and an increase in prepaid expenses  prepaid income taxes and other assets of approximately million primarily due to the broadcom payment  offset by a decrease of approximately million in accounts receivable  an increase in accrued taxes of approximately million  and a decrease in inventories of approximately million 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during fiscal was approximately million compared to cash provided by approximately million for fiscal the current period usage of cash was primarily related to our acquisition of endace for approximately million and purchases of property and equipment of approximately million  offset by the maturities of investments  net of purchases  of approximately million 
financing activities cash used in financing activities for fiscal was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal the current period usage of cash was primarily due to approximately million of purchases of noncontrolling interests in endace  and payroll tax withholdings on behalf of employees for restricted stock of approximately million  partially offset by the proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock plans of approximately million 
prospective capital needs in early august  our board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
in april  upon receipt of an unsolicited takeover proposal and related tender offer of broadcom to acquire us  our board of directors elected to temporarily suspend any activity under the share repurchase plan 
in light of broadcom allowing its tender offer to expire on july   emulex s board of directors elected to reactivate the million share repurchase plan effective july  from june  through june   the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million at an average purchase price of per share under this plan 
our board of directors has not set an expiration date for the plan 
therefore  we may repurchase additional shares under this plan from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions 
it is expected that any future share repurchases will be financed by available cash and cash from operations 
we plan to continue our strategic investment in research and development  sales and marketing  capital equipment  and facilities 
we may also consider internal and external investment opportunities in order to achieve our growth and market leadership goals  including licensing and product development alignment agreements with our suppliers  customers  and other third parties 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  current investments  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to support our working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and stock repurchasing expenditures for at least the next months  although we may also consider external financing sources 
we currently do not have any outstanding lines of credit or other borrowings 
we have disclosed outstanding legal proceedings in note  commitments and contingences  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k  including the consolidated patent infringement lawsuit filed by broadcom against us 
this lawsuit continues to present risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations  including loss of patent rights  monetary damages  and injunction against the sale of accused products 
we continue to present a vigorous post trial defense against this on going lawsuit  and have appealed the trial verdict 
on july   we entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which both parties agreed to settle and release certain claims related to the patent infringement litigation 
the settlement agreement provided for certain amendments to the april  permanent injunction  and dismissals of certain allegations of the lawsuit  including portions of the scheduled re trial 
we also received a worldwide limited license to the patent  the patent  the patent and related families for certain fields of use including fibre channel applications 
we expect to incur incremental mitigation  product redesign  appeal related expenses during fiscal in the range of million to million 
in addition  we have agreed to participate in certain customer royalty obligations arising under their licensing agreements with broadcom that are expected to be from million to million during fiscal such costs will reduce gross margins in the periods accrued 
see product redesign activities and potential royalty obligations in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
also see third party claims of intellectual property infringement could adversely affect our business and we are dependent on sole source and limited source third party suppliers and ems providers for our products in part i  item a risk factors  of this annual report on form k for a description of certain risks relating to the litigation with broadcom that could impact our liquidity and prospective capital needs 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of june   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
we issue letters of credit or bank guarantees in the normal course of business as required by certain vendors 
as of june   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of which approximately million were secured by restricted cash deposits that have been classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet 
approximately million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees are not secured 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity in future periods 
the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary  possibly materially  from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period total thereafter in thousands leases purchase commitments other commitments total lease payments include common area maintenance cam charges 
purchase commitments represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of june  although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
other commitments consist primarily of commitments for software license fees of approximately million 
excludes approximately million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment 
see note  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k 
the expected timing of payments for the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity we do not believe our cash and cash equivalents are subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short terms to maturity 
as of june   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
as of june   the balance of our investment portfolio was zero as the securities reached maturity and the proceeds were not re invested in other securities 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to generally be minimal 
currently  sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars usd  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the usd relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the usd relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations for a portion of our expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the usd  primarily with respect to our operations in india and new zealand  for which we do not maintain an active hedging program 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates have affected  and could continue to affect our business and results of operations
