item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts introduction the company financial results continued to improve significantly in comparison to and the company net income available to common stockholders was  compared to  in  an improvement of over percent 
on a diluted per common share basis  earnings improved to from 
the most significant difference from last year was the payment in of preferred stock dividends and accretion of discount totaling  the absence of preferred stock dividends and accretion is due to the redemption of the preferred stock on june  we earned percent on average assets in compared to percent in the return on average equity roe increased during to percent from percent in during  we paid our common stockholders  per common share in dividends compared to  per common share in the dividend declared in the first quarter of was per common share 
beginning in  we began a program of quantitative peer analysis for evaluating company results 
we have identified a set of publicly traded peer financial institutions against which we compare our performance each quarter 
our peer group consists of bankfinancial corporation  baylake corp  cfs bancorp  inc  firstbank corporation  first mid illinois bancshares  inc  hills bancorporation  horizon bancorp  isabella bank corporation  macatawa bank corporation  mercantile bank corporation  metrocorp bancshares  inc  midwestone financial group  inc  mutualfirst financial  inc  nasb financial  inc  pulaski financial corp  and qcr holdings  inc 
our goal is to perform at or near the top of those peers relative to what we consider to be four key metrics return on average equity  return on average assets  efficiency ratio  and texas ratio 
we believe these measures encompass the factors that define the performance of a community bank 
through september   we ranked in the top percent of our defined peer group for each of these measures 
we expect that trend to have continued through the end of our company was named a small cap all star by the investment banking firm sandler o neill during the third quarter of this was a list of the top performing publicly traded community banks and thrifts in the country according to the criteria set by sandler o neill 
it was an honor to receive that type of recognition by people who understand the banking industry 
the texas ratio  which is the ratio of nonperforming assets to tangible capital plus the allowance for loan losses  improved to percent as of december   compared to percent as of december  these are both significant improvements from the percent reported as of the end of this decline was the result of continued improvement in the level of nonperforming assets 
management continues to devote the appropriate resources to monitoring and reducing nonperforming assets 
net interest income declined to  in compared to  in  primarily due to continued downward pressure on interest rates 
noninterest income improved by percent  primarily due to an increase in gains and fees on sales of residential mortgages 
the low interest rate environment continues to result in higher volumes of mortgage activity 
we have also added mortgage loan originators to capitalize on this source of revenue 
noninterest expense held steady compared to the prior year as both fdic insurance expense and costs related to other real estate owned declined and were offset by higher salary and benefit costs 
our efficiency ratio increased slightly to percent for from percent in our loan portfolio grew percent to  at december   from  at the end of  with a significant portion of that growth coming in the fourth quarter 
despite the continuing uncertainty in the economy  our loan customers are beginning to move ahead with plans to grow their businesses 
while we have experienced positive growth in  we cannot predict when or by how much our loan portfolio will continue to grow 
deposits increased percent by the end of compared to the end of both of these happened as a result of our vision of achieving and sustaining a position of industry envy and admiration 
one of the building blocks of achieving our vision is through customer loyalty and retention 
we continue to build relationships by expanding business with current customers and striving to gain new customers 
we have strong capital resources 
our stock price increased approximately percent from the end of to the end of  our existing capital ratios are strong  and our earnings are solid 
we understand the things that are required to be a great community bank for our customers and stockholders 
our core corporate values and goals are defined by that understanding 
our team is focused on being  and remaining  a great community bank 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts from the political  regulatory  and economic perspectives  we expect will be a year of continued uncertainty as our political leaders continue to struggle to accomplish significant legislative actions 
we expect the unusually low interest rate environment to continue in the current year  so we are implementing strategies to maintain our net interest margin 
we anticipate the company will be profitable in at a level that compares favorably with our peers 
the amount of our future profit will depend  in large part  on the amount of loan losses we incur and our ability to grow the loan portfolio 
our loan portfolio still presents somewhat higher than normal risks because it contains a significant amount of loans secured by commercial real estate 
while we believe we have aggressively addressed declining real estate valuation issues when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  future changes in real estate valuations in and beyond remain uncertain 
the following discussion describes the consolidated operations of the company  including west bank  west bank wholly owned subsidiary wb funding corporation which owns an interest in smartypig  llc  and west bank percent owned subsidiary icd iv  llc a community development entity  and the company financial condition as of december  critical accounting policies this report is based on the company audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the financial information contained in these statements is based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
however  the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
the company significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments  management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those related to asset impairment judgments  including fair value and otti of available for sale investment securities  the valuation of other real estate owned  and the allowance for loan losses 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred income taxes 
the company evaluates each of its investment securities whose value has declined below amortized cost to determine whether the decline in fair value is otti 
the investment portfolio is evaluated for otti by segregating the portfolio into two segments and applying the appropriate otti model 
investment securities classified as available for sale are generally evaluated for otti under fasb asc  investments debt and equity securities 
however  certain purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  including asset backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  that had credit ratings of below aa at the time of purchase are evaluated using the model outlined in fasb asc  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
in determining otti under the fasb asc model  the review takes into consideration the severity and duration of the decline in fair value  the length of time expected for recovery  the financial condition of the issuer  and other qualitative factors  as well as whether the company intends to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not the company will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
under the fasb asc model for the second segment of the portfolio  the company compares the present value of the remaining cash flows as estimated at the preceding evaluation date to the current expected remaining cash flows 
an otti is deemed to have occurred if there has been an adverse change in the remaining expected future cash flows 
when otti occurs under either model  the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company intends to sell  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the otti is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the otti is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected  using the original yield as the discount rate  and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the assessment of whether an otti exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at the time 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts other real estate owned includes real estate properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure 
properties are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure thus establishing a new cost basis 
fair value is determined by management by obtaining appraisals or other market value information at least annually 
any write downs in value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
after foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management by obtaining updated appraisals or other market information 
any subsequent write downs are recorded as a charge to operations  if necessary  to reduce the carrying value of a property to the updated fair value less estimated selling cost 
net costs related to the holding of properties are included in noninterest expense 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely 
the company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio  including timely identification of potential problem loans 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses  incorporating a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative 
quantitative factors include the company historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  known information about individual loans  and other factors 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the company market areas and the expected trend of those economic conditions 
while management uses the best information available to make its evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or the other factors relied upon 
to the extent that actual results differ from forecasts and management judgment  the allowance for loan losses may be greater or less than future charge offs 
results of operations compared to overview total net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december  the most significant difference from the prior year was the payment of preferred stock dividends and accretion of discount totaling  in the company outstanding preferred stock was redeemed on june   so there were no such dividends and accretion of discount in basic and diluted earnings per common share were and for and  respectively 
the company roe was percent compared to percent in the return on average assets roa was percent  compared to percent for the prior year 
net income was  for compared to  for the improvement in net income in compared to was primarily because of higher gains and fees on sales of residential mortgages and lower write downs on other real estate owned 
the company has consistently used the efficiency ratio as one of its key financial metrics to measure expense control 
for the year ended december   the company efficiency ratio increased slightly to percent from the prior year ratio of percent 
this ratio is computed by dividing noninterest expense excluding other real estate owned expense by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income excluding securities gains and net impairment losses 
the ratio for both years is significantly better than peer group averages  which were generally around percent according to data in the september bank holding company performance report  which is prepared by the federal reserve board division of banking supervision and regulation 
net interest income net interest income declined to  for as the impact of lower yields on loans and investment securities exceeded the savings from lower rates paid on deposits and borrowings and a higher level of interest earning assets 
the net interest margin declined to percent from percent in the average yield on earning assets declined basis points  while the rate on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points 
the net interest spread  which is the difference between the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities  declined to percent from percent a year earlier 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts loan volume loan quality total loans increased  to  as of december   from  a year earlier

nonperforming loans at december   totaled  or percent of total loans 
at december   nonperforming loans totaled  or percent of total loans 
nonperforming loans include loans on nonaccrual status  loans past due days or more  and loans that have been considered tdr due to the borrowers experiencing financial difficulties

the company texas ratio was percent as of december   compared to percent as of december  the ratio for both years is significantly better than peer group averages  which were approximately percent according to data in the september bank holding company performance report

noninterest income the following table shows the variance from the prior year in the noninterest income categories shown in the consolidated statements of income

debit card usage fees continued to show positive growth in as customers continued to move away from traditional check writing 
we believe these fees may decline in the future due to the dodd frank act and the federal reserve final rule which sets a cap on interchange fees at a rate below the market driven levels 
while financial institutions such as west bank  with less than ten billion dollars in assets  are exempt from the cap  industry groups believe the price controls will have a negative impact on community banks over time 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts the volume of originations of residential mortgages sold into the secondary market during increased to  from  in  resulting in a percent growth in revenue 
the low interest rate environment continues to fuel the growth along with an improved level of home sales in the company market areas 
also contributing to the growth in volume was the addition of origination staff in the des moines market in each of the last three quarters of the company plans to continue to expand its mortgage origination staff to capitalize on the opportunities in its local markets 
approximately percent of originations during involved homeowners refinancing current mortgages in an effort to lock in low interest rates 
the company believes secondary market loan revenues will remain strong due to the historically low interest rates  although the level of refinancings may be lower as the number of homeowners still seeking a lower rate may decline significantly 
the lower increase in cash value of bank owned life insurance is due to lower crediting rates within the policies due to the low interest rate environment 
gain from bank owned life insurance occurred due to the deaths of a bank officer in each of and as of december   the company held one pooled tps it considered to have otti 
as a result of quarterly evaluations of this security  impairment losses of and were recognized during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company took advantage of an opportunity to sell two collateralized mortgage obligations in the second quarter of at a gain and was able to replace them with similar bonds with comparable yields  thus resulting in net gains of for there were no sales of investment securities during gains from sales of other assets in included a gain on sale of a foreclosed asset in the first quarter and the sale of an interest in a partnership in the third quarter

the benefit cost increases were primarily for payroll taxes  health insurance  and k plan contributions 
the k increase was primarily due to an increase in the company matching contribution which became effective january  
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts occupancy expense increased due to higher depreciation expense on purchases of equipment and rental expense as additional space was leased 
data processing expense increased in due to fees related to a new commercial loan management software program and enhancements to deposit systems 
management expects data processing expense to be lower in  based on comparable transaction volumes  as a result of renegotiating the contract with the company core processor 
there were two reasons for the decline in fdic insurance expense compared to the first was the april   change in the assessment base from total average deposits to total average assets less tangible capital 
the second was an upgrade in west bank regulatory risk classification on june  the level of expense in is expected to hold steady when compared to  unless total assets increase significantly

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net interest income the company largest component of net income is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets  consisting primarily of loans and investments  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  consisting of deposits and borrowings 
fluctuations in net interest income can result from the combination of changes in the balances of asset and liability categories and changes in interest rates 
interest rates earned and paid are also affected by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  and by competitive factors  government policies  and the action of regulatory authorities 
net interest margin is a measure of the net return on interest earning assets and is computed by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by the average of total interest earning assets for the year 
for the years ended december    and  the company net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was   and percent  respectively 
the reduction in the net interest margin in was primarily due to continued downward pressure on market rates 
tax equivalent net interest income for declined as interest income on interest earning assets declined more than interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  despite an increase in average earning assets 
management believes the net interest margin will remain under pressure if interest rates stay at these historically low levels as expected 
two management actions will assist in maintaining the net interest margin 
the first was the modification of  of the company fhlb advances in december the fhlb advances were refinanced as variable rate borrowings tied to three month libor 
the overall interest rate effective on december   on the fhlb advances was percent including amortization of prepayment fees  compared to percent as of december  to prevent a negative impact to interest expense in the long term  the company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that in effect convert the payment streams to fixed rate beginning in and the second strategy was the decision to invest approximately  of federal funds sold in investment securities in the first quarter of approximately  of those funds had been invested by mid february 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts rate and volume analysis the rate and volume analysis shown below  on a tax equivalent basis  is used to determine how much of the change in interest income or expense is the result of a change in volume or a change in interest yield or rate

tax exempt income has been converted to a tax equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of percent and is adjusted for the effect of the nondeductible interest expense associated with owning tax exempt investments and loans 
tax equivalent interest income and fees on loans declined  for the year ended december   compared to  while the average volume increased slightly as west bank lenders focused on expanding existing customer relationships and developing new relationships 
the average yield on loans declined basis points for compared to the yield on the company loan portfolio is affected by the mix of the portfolio  the effects of competition  the interest rate environment  the amount of nonperforming loans  and reversals of previously accrued interest on charged off loans 
the political and interest rate environments can influence the volume of new loan originations and the mix of variable rate versus fixed rate loans 
the average balance of investment securities in was  higher than in  while the yield declined basis points 
the decline was caused by lower available yields in the market for purchases and to a lesser extent the calls of higher yielding municipal securities as municipalities refinanced debt to lower their interest expense 
the average balance of federal funds sold and other short term investments declined  during as mentioned earlier  in the company intends to further decrease the average balance of federal funds sold to lower levels while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity 
the average rate paid on deposits declined to percent from percent for the combination of lower market rates and a decline in average time deposit balances caused interest expense on deposits to decline by  the company lowered interest rates on certain deposit products during the first and third quarters in response to the continued low interest rate environment 
the average balance of time deposits declined  compared to as the company allowed wholesale deposits to mature without renewal and fewer retail customers have been willing to lock in low interest rates for an extended period of time 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts the average rate paid on other borrowings declined basis points to percent  primarily due to a rate reduction on securities sold under agreements to repurchase

one tps  with a fair value of  has otti and is on nonaccrual status 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts generally  management obtains the fair value of investment securities at the end of each reporting period via a third party pricing service 
management  with the assistance of an independent investment advisory firm  reviewed the valuation process used by the third party and believes that process is valid 
on a quarterly basis management corroborates the fair values of investment securities by obtaining pricing from an independent investment advisory firm and compares the two sets of fair values 
any significant variances are reviewed and investigated 
in addition  the company has instituted a practice of further testing the fair values by selecting a sample of securities from each category of investment securities 
for that sample  the prices are further validated by management  with assistance from an independent investment advisory firm  by obtaining details of the inputs used by the pricing service 
those inputs were independently tested  and we concluded the fair values were consistent with gaap and securities were properly classified in the fair value hierarchy 
as of december   existing gross unrealized losses of  are considered to be temporary in nature due to market interest rate fluctuations and illiquid markets  not reduced estimated cash flows  and the company has the ability and the intent to hold the related securities with unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery  which may be at maturity 
as discussed below  the remaining  of the total unrealized losses relate to one pooled tps  which is considered to have otti 
as of december   all of the company state and political subdivisions investments were with iowa communities  and all were considered to have acceptable credit risks 
during the first quarter of  the company purchased securities originated by municipalities in states other than iowa due to their somewhat higher yields compared to iowa municipalities with similar credit risks 
it is anticipated that more of the future investments in municipal securities will be from states other than iowa 
collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities consist of residential mortgage pass through securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association gnma or issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma and real estate mortgage investment conduits guaranteed by the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or gnma 
the debt obligations were all within the credit ratings acceptable under west bank investment policy 
as of december   the company held a pooled tps  alesco preferred funding x  ltd  with an unrealized loss of  that has otti and has been placed on nonaccrual status 
as of december   the unrealized loss of  was reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes of  the accrual of interest on an investment security is discontinued when a security is deemed to have otti 
the company engaged an independent consulting firm to assist management with the valuation of this security 
based on that valuation  management determined the security had an estimated fair value of  at december  the methodology for determining the appropriate discount rate for a tps for purposes of determining fair value combines an evaluation of current market yields for comparable corporate and structured credit products with an evaluation of the risks associated with the tps cash flows in question 
details on the methodology for determining fair value for this security is more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
based on the valuation work performed for this security  credit losses of   and were recognized for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company will continue to periodically estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the security 
at december   the most significant risk of a future impairment charge relates to the company investment in the tps discussed above 
as previously mentioned  management has concluded that only the pooled tps has otti 
any potential future loss that would be considered a credit loss or an increase in the amount of the unrealized loss attributed to credit would negatively impact net income and regulatory capital  however  as previously noted  the fair market value adjustment at december   has already been recorded against equity 
as of december   the company did not have securities from a single issuer  except for the united states government or its agencies that exceeded percent of consolidated stockholders equity

the loan pipeline as of the first quarter of is strong  and management believes the company is well positioned to continue to grow its loan portfolio 
for a description of the loan segments  see note in item of this filing 
the interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  the amount of the loan  and the maturity of the loan 
competitive pressures  market interest rates  the availability of funds  and government regulation further influence the rate charged on a loan

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts the accrual of interest on past due and other impaired loans is generally discontinued when loan payments are past due days or when  in the opinion of management  the borrower may be unable to make payments as they become due 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
generally  all payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status are applied to the principal balance of the loan 
for the years ended december    and  interest income that would have been recorded during the nonaccrual period under the original terms of such loans was approximately   and  respectively 
a loan may be removed from nonaccrual status when payments have resumed and it is reasonable to expect continued payment performance 
in certain cases  interest may continue to accrue on loans past due more than days when the value of the collateral is sufficient to cover both the principal amount of the loan and accrued interest and the loan is in the process of collection 
a loan may be considered a tdr loan when the interest rate is reduced below that of a new loan with comparable risk or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date and the borrower is considered to be experiencing financial difficulties 
the payment history of the borrower  along with a current analysis of its cash flows  is used to determine the restructured terms 
underwriting procedures are similar to those of new loan originations and renewals of performing loans in that current financial statements and tax returns are obtained and analyzed 
a current assessment of collateral is performed 
the approval process for tdr loans is the same as that for new loans 
the tdr loans with extended terms are accounted for as impaired until ongoing performance is established 
any tdr loan with an interest rate concession remains in tdr status until paid off 
interest income on tdr loans is recognized pursuant to the revised terms of the loan agreement 
a tdr loan may be reported in the nonaccrual category if it is not performing in accordance with its revised terms 
interest income on other impaired loans is based upon the terms of the underlying loan agreement 
however  the recorded net investment in impaired loans  including accrued interest  is limited to the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or the observable fair market value of the loan collateral 
the average balance of all impaired loans during was approximately  interest income recognized on impaired loans in   and was approximately   and  respectively 
as of december   west bank had identified approximately  in loans to four commercial real estate customers and in loans to one commercial customer as potential problem loans 
none of these loans were in default at the end of the year 
it is not now possible to predict the degree of problems these loans may develop 
however  west bank is closely monitoring each of them 
the composition of other real estate owned as of december  and  is shown in the following table 
construction  land development  and other land family residential properties multifamily commercial properties the company is actively marketing the assets included in the previous table 
there has been increased interest from potential buyers  but demand for commercial real estate and development land remains relatively low  and we believe potential buyers are searching for bargains 
valuations of other real estate owned are performed by management at least annually and sometimes more frequently  so that the properties are carried at current market value less estimated disposal costs 
market values are determined by obtaining updated appraisals or other market information 
the construction and land development category includes four properties in the des moines metropolitan area  one property in the iowa city market  one property in missouri  and one property in arkansas 
the family properties consist of one home in the des moines area and one in the iowa city market 
the commercial property consists of one commercial facility in the des moines area 
summary of the allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is management best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  the value and adequacy of loan collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  the levels and trends of loans by segment  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
this evaluation focuses on factors such as specific loan reviews  changes in the components of the loan portfolio given the current and forecasted economic conditions  and historical loss experience 
any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan concern about whether the customer cash flow or net worth is sufficient to repay the loan  delinquency status  criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination  the suspension of interest accrual  or other factors  including whether the loan has other special or unusual characteristics that suggest special monitoring is warranted 
the company concentration risks include geographic concentration in central iowa 
the local economy is comprised primarily of service industries and state and county governments 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  further reduction in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in circumstances or later acquired information 
furthermore  changes in future economic activity are always uncertain 
identifiable sectors within the general economy are subject to additional volatility  which at any time may have a substantial impact on the loan portfolio 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as integral parts of their examination processes  periodically review the estimated losses on loans 
such agencies may require west bank to recognize additional losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
change in the allowance for loan losses west bank policy is to charge off loans when  in management opinion  the loan is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize future recoveries 
the following table summarizes activity in the company allowance for loan losses by loan segment for the years indicated  including amounts of loans charged off  amounts of recoveries  additions to the allowance charged to income  and related ratios

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts according to the september bank holding company performance report prepared by the federal reserve board division of banking supervision and regulation  the percentage of net charge offs to average loans for all banks with total assets between billion and billion was percent for the first nine months of as shown above  the company net charge off ratio was percent  considerably below the peer group average for the first three quarters of as gross charge offs declined percent compared to the  of charge offs in the construction  land  and land development segment during related to two customers 
west bank has a significant portion of its loan portfolio in commercial real estate loans  commercial lines of credit  commercial term loans  and construction or land development loans 
west bank typical commercial borrower is a small or medium sized  privately owned iowa business entity 
west bank commercial loans typically have greater credit risks than residential mortgage or consumer loans because they often have larger balances and repayment usually depends on the borrowers successful business operations 
commercial loans also involve additional risks because they generally are not fully repaid over the loan period and  thus  usually require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity 
when the economy turns downward  as in and  commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans and the value of their assets  which are usually pledged as collateral  may decrease rapidly and significantly 
although management believes that the real estate markets in which west bank makes loans are not as depressed as in some other parts of the country  real estate related credit risks continue to be somewhat higher than normal in our markets 
nonperforming assets continued to decline in we are experiencing changes in the components of nonperforming assets as certain loans move from nonaccrual status to other real estate owned and ultimately are sold 
breakdown of allowance for loan losses by category the following table sets forth information concerning the company allocation of the allowance for loan losses by segment as of the dates indicated 
amount amount amount amount amount balance at end of period applicable to commercial real estate construction  land  and land development family residential first mortgages home equity commercial consumer and other loans percent of loans in each category to total loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon the change in balances outstanding in the various categories  the historical net loss experience by category  which can vary over time  specific reserves for loans considered impaired  and management assessment of economic factors that may influence potential losses in the loan portfolio 
prior to  the historical experience factor was calculated using a three year average 
that average was updated once per year at the end of each calendar year 
in  that calculation was modified to use a rolling quarter average 
it was felt that by using a rolling quarter average  the most recent charge off experience is factored into the analysis sooner 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of december   includes specific reserves of  in the commercial category for four borrowers   in the construction  land  and land development category for one borrower  in the home equity category for one borrower  and in the commercial real estate category for two borrowers

total deposits as of december   were  an increase of percent compared to the end of the growth was primarily in noninterest bearing demand and money market savings which increased over and percent  respectively  compared to december  approximately percent of the total certificates of deposit issued by west bank mature in the next year 
it is anticipated that a significant portion of these certificates will be renewed  even though certificates of deposit are not considered an attractive investment option for some segments of our customer base in the current low interest rate environment 
in the event a substantial volume of certificates are not renewed  management believes the company has sufficient liquid assets and borrowing lines to fund the potential runoff 
however  a sustained reduction in overall deposit volume would have a significant negative impact on the company operations and liquidity

the fhlb advances have maturity dates of through the fluctuation in the balances of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase is dependent upon the loan demand and investment strategy of downstream correspondent banks for federal funds purchased and customer cash flows for securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
other short term borrowings as of december   consisted of participation in the federal reserve treasury  tax  and loan option notes program 
that program permanently ended on december off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  west bank commits to extend credit in the form of loan commitments and standby letters of credit in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these commitments expose west bank to varying degrees of credit and market risks in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and are subject to the same credit policies as are loans recorded on the balance sheets 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts west bank exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
west bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
management of the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of these commitments 
off balance sheet commitments are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k

the company principal source of funds is deposits 
other sources include loan principal repayments  proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities  principal payments on collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities  federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  advances from the fhlb  and funds provided by operations 
liquidity management is conducted on both a daily and a long term basis 
investments in liquid assets are adjusted based on expected loan demand  projected loan maturities and payments  expected deposit flows  and the objectives set by west bank asset liability management policy 
the company had liquid assets cash and cash equivalents of  at december   which was almost twice as much as at december  the increase was caused by the significant increase in deposits in the fourth quarter of the company plans to invest approximately  of these funds in investment securities during the first quarter of west bank had additional borrowing capacity available from the fhlb of approximately  at december  in addition  west bank had  in borrowing capacity available through unsecured  and  available through secured  federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks 
west bank was not drawing on any of these lines of credit as of december  net cash from continuing operating activities contributed   and  to liquidity for the years   and  respectively 
the combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets  cash flows from operations  and additional borrowing capacity provide strong liquidity for the company as of december  the company and west bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies 
those requirements include a requirement for bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks to maintain total capital to risk weighted assets of at least percent  of which at least half must be tier capital  and a tier leverage ratio of at least percent 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the company consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company had a total risk based capital ratio of percent  a tier capital ratio of percent  and a tier leverage ratio of percent 
as of december   west bank had ratios of percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
as these ratios indicate  west bank was considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes as of december  during  the federal bank regulatory agencies issued joint proposed rules that would increase minimum capital ratios  add a new minimum common equity ratio  add a new capital conservation buffer  and would change the risk weightings of certain assets 
during the fourth quarter of  after hearing from many constituencies with concerns about the additional regulatory burdens the proposals would place on community banks and their holding companies  the implementation of these proposed rules has been indefinitely delayed 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts the company total stockholders equity increased to  at december   from  at december  the increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to net income less cash dividends paid

interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the exposure to earnings and capital arising from changes in interest rates 
management objectives are to manage interest rate risk to foster consistent growth of earnings and capital 
interest rate risk management focuses on fluctuations in net interest income identified through computer simulations used to evaluate volatility  interest rate  spread  and volume assumptions 
this risk is quantified and compared against tolerance levels 
the company utilizes an outside vendor to run computer software simulations to measure its exposure to potential interest rate changes 
for various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates  this analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income 
the simulations allow for ongoing assessment of interest rate sensitivity and can include the impact of potential new business strategies 
another measure of interest rate sensitivity is the gap ratio 
this ratio indicates the amount of interest earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time 
a gap ratio of indicates a matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal 
a gap ratio of less than indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period  and a ratio greater than indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities 
the company gap ratio is shown on the following page 
inflation the primary impact of inflation on the company operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs  and operating overhead 
unlike most industries  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution performance than they would have on nonfinancial companies 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets and  if significant  require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than otherwise would be necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk arising from its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the company net interest income 
management continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate this risk 
management does not believe that the company primary market risk exposure and management of that exposure in materially changed compared to 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share amounts the following table presents the estimated change in net interest income for the coming months under several scenarios of assumed interest rate changes for the rate shock levels shown scenario change basis points rising basis points rising basis points rising base as of december   the estimated effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would cause the company net interest income to increase by approximately percent  or  in the estimated effect of an immediate decrease in rates is not reasonably calculable due to the current historically low interest rate environment 
because the majority of liabilities subject to interest rate movements in the short term are of the type that generally lag interest rate movements in the market  they do not change by the same magnitude in the short term as the change in market rates 
computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity  expected cash flows or repricing opportunities  and the resulting interest sensitivity gap of the company interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the cumulative interest sensitivity gap at december  the expected maturities are presented on a contractual basis or  if more relevant  are based on projected call dates 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because of prepayment assumptions and early withdrawal of deposits 
months or less over through months over through years over years total interest earning assets federal funds sold and other short term investments securities available for sale federal home loan bank stock loans held for sale loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits savings  interest bearing demand  and money markets time federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase long term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap per period cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest sensitivity gap ratio as of december   the company cumulative gap ratio for assets and liabilities repricing within one year was  meaning that the company is liability sensitive over the cumulative month period 
in other words  more interest bearing liabilities will be subject to repricing within that time frame than interest earning assets 
however  the majority of the interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing within these time frames are savings  money market  and interest bearing demand deposits 
these types of deposits generally do not reprice as quickly or by the same magnitude as changes in other short term interest rates
