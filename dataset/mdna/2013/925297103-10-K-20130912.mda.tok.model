item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial trends fiscal year proved to be a challenging year for versar  with decreased revenue and net income  compared to  although our balance sheet remains strong and is a reflection of our ability to continue to improve liquidity and working capital 
ongoing macro economic issues  such as sequestration and ongoing federal budget issues resulted in slower and fewer contract awards across the federal government 
for the near term  it appears that the united states government continues to face substantial fiscal and economic challenges that affect funding for its non discretionary and discretionary budgets 
we believe these conditions will continue based on a variety of factors  including the continued effects of high unemployment  the continuing weak european financial markets  and the existence of debt reduction pressures which will continue to put pressure on a full economic recovery 
in this challenging economic environment  we focus on those opportunities where funding is non discretionary for our customers such as sustainable range management  unexploded ordnance  performance based remediation  and construction contract management 
we will also continue to focus on areas that we believe offer attractive enough returns to our clients that they will continue to fund efforts  such as construction type services both in the united states and internationally  improvements in energy efficiency  and facility upgrades 
we have invested heavily in business development activities designed to specifically tailor responses to a customer s value solution and sustainability needs 
we have invested in new internal technologies to streamline productivity and have realized benefits from continued cost reduction efforts concentrated on our fixed and controllable expenses 
we have decided to discontinue the operations of our lab  telecom  and products components as they are no longer aligned with our business strategy and have ended revenue generating business operations 
we believe that versar s business segments have the expertise to identify and respond to the challenges raised by the global economic issues we face and are positioned in the coming year to address these concerns 
our business operates through the following three business segments ecm  esg  and psg 
these segments are segregated based on the nature of the work  business processes  customer bases and the business environment in which each of the segments operates 
there are risk factors or uncertainties that could significantly impact our future financial performance 
a sample of these risks is listed below 
for a complete discussion of these risk factors and uncertainties refer to item a 
risk factors  herein 
we operate in highly competitive industries  a reduction or delay in pending awards by government agencies could adversely affect us  our inability to win or renew government contacts could adversely affect us  we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally  our failure to properly manage projects may result in additional costs or claims  an economic downturn may adversely affect our business  in order to succeed we need to keep up with a variety of rapidly changing technologies  we are highly dependent on key personnel  future acquisitions may not go as expected and may have unexpected costs and consequences  the government may adopt new contract laws or regulations at any time

gross profit for fiscal year was million  a decrease of compared to million during the fiscal year 
the gross profit percentage declined slightly by to from in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million a decrease of compared to million during the fiscal year

fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of compared to million during the fiscal year 
the fiscal year decrease partially resulted from nonrecurring equipment purchase revenue recorded during the fiscal year of approximately million attributable to the tooele chemical demilitarization project in our ecm business segment 
additionally  the decrease resulted from the fact that fewer projects were awarded to our esg business segment during fiscal year in the second half of fiscal year the esg business segment submitted a large number of business proposals in an attempt to bolster their pipeline and increase the number or projects awarded 
the decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenue during the fiscal year within our ecm business segment resulting from additional awards of title ii construction management services projects and electrical inspection projects 
purchased services and materials for fiscal year was million  a decrease of compared to million during the fiscal year 
the decrease largely resulted from the nonrecurring equipment purchase and subcontractor costs for the tooele chemical demilitarization project that occurred in the fiscal year and also from a decrease in projects awarded to our esg business segment 
direct costs of services and overhead for fiscal year were million  a decrease of compared to million during the fiscal year

results of operations by business segment during fiscal year management realigned the company s organizational structure resulting in its operations being reorganized into the following three business segments ecm  esg  and psg 
during fiscal year  management revised its method of allocating overhead to the segments in order to refine the information used by our chief operating decision maker codm 
the presentation of and has been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
the new methodology allocates certain overhead costs proportionally on the basis of direct labor  while the old methodology allocated such overhead costs on a non proportional basis 
the tables below set forth the operating results for these three business segments for the fiscal years ended june   june   and july   not including discontinued operations 
ecm for the fiscal years ended june  june  july  in thousands gross revenue    purchased services and materials  at cost   direct costs of services and overhead   gross profit  from continuing operations   profit loss from discontinued operations  before tax  gross profit    gross profit percentage from continuing operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million or compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily a result of reductions in government spending for international reconstruction operations both in iraq for electrical inspection services and in afghanistan for air force civil engineer center afcec title ii construction management services 
this slowdown was coupled with reduced domestic revenue of approximately million related to the completion of the tooele chemical demilitarization project during fiscal year and reduced revenue from domestic construction of approximately million 
management is focusing domestic construction operations to specific locations and projects  and as a result of being more selective  we have seen reduced revenue from these operations  international management is currently focused on leveraging the success in the middle east by increasing business development efforts with other us government and non governmental agencies in order to offset reduced dod business and minimize the resulting reduction of revenues 
in may  the company s joint venture with parsons was awarded a new prime contract from the us army corps of engineers usace  middle east district med to provide construction phase support services cpss throughout multiple countries within the central command area of responsibility 
the indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contract is a single award with a maximum five year period of performance consisting of a base year and four option years with a maximum contract capacity is million 
additionally  in october of fiscal year we were awarded a new prime contract with the us army corps of engineers usace  middle east district  to provide afghanistan national subject matter experts to perform on site construction management support services for assigned projects supporting two usace engineer districts in afghanistan 
the indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contract is a single award with a maximum four and a halfyear period of performance consisting of a base year and three options years 
the maximum contract capacity over the entire length of the contract is million 
this contract is for personal services in exclusive support of the usace construction mission in afghanistan 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million or compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was directly related the completion of the tooele chemical demilitarization project during fiscal year and the completion of the iraq electrical inspection program 
management has decided that the company s lab  telecom  and product components are no longer aligned with the company business strategy 
as such  management has elected to discontinue the company s operations in these three components of the ecm segment and has ended revenue generating business operations 
combined  these three components contributed an approximate million additional decrease in gross profit 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of compared to million during the corresponding period of the fiscal year 
this decrease was largely from nonrecurring equipment purchase revenue earned in the last fiscal year of approximately million attributable to the tooele chemical demilitarization project 
additionally  we had fewer construction projects awarded to our us based construction group during fiscal year and experienced decreased government spending for electrical inspection services 
this decrease in gross revenue  however  was partially offset by increased government spending earlier in the fiscal year for title ii services 
as discussed above  we have changed the method of allocating overhead to the reportable segments and have recast previous year information to conform to the new methodology 
under our revised methodology  gross profit for this segment increased million  or  to million in fy  compared to million in fy although the dollar values changed under the revised methodology  the direction of the fluctuation and the corresponding explanation have remained consistent 
this increase resulted from our effective project management and tight control over all costs related to the title ii construction management services projects and our electrical inspection projects 
additionally  our us based construction group continued to reduce costs relative to the decrease in gross revenue in this portion of the business  thus contributing to the improved gross margin in fiscal year esg for the fiscal years ended june  june  july  in thousands gross revenue    purchased services and materials  at cost   direct costs of services and overhead   gross profit    gross profit percentage fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross revenue for fiscal year was million  an increase of million or compared to million for fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in work being performed on pbrs for the us air force reflecting both the transition from planning phases to site work phases  and the startup of pbr activities at additional bases 
we continue to see revenue increases associated with our uxo projects at nellis afb and fort irwin  ca 
we have also experienced an increase in municipal storm water contract awards reflecting growth in our natural resource services 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  an increase of million or compared to a loss of million for fiscal year gross profit margin improvement compared to fiscal year primarily reflects the million project profit attributable to the uxo project at fort irwin  ca 
the segment continues to see an increase in profitability as a result of an increase in direct labor it provides on the pbrs and uxo projects 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of compared to million during the fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily the result of the award to us of fewer contracts during this period 
in addition  operations from a project acquired with the advent acquisition began wind down during fiscal year and we did not see that revenue return in fiscal year as discussed above  we have changed the method of allocating overhead to the reportable segments and have recast previous year information to conform to the new methodology 
under our revised methodology  this segment realized losses of million during fy  compared to gross profit of million in fy although the dollar values changed under the revised methodology  the directions of the fluctuation and the corresponding explanation have remained consistent 
the decrease was primarily a result of increased overhead costs incurred during fiscal year related to our increased efforts to identify business opportunities and an expanded proposal process to gain additional contracts 
additionally  the decrease in revenue during the fiscal year contributed to the decrease in gross profit 
these decreases were partially offset by the positive contribution from our operations in ft 
irwin  ca 
psg for the fiscal years ended june  june  july  in thousands gross revenue    purchased services and materials  at cost   direct costs of services and overhead   gross profit    gross profit percentage fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million or compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in project awards resulting from versar s loss of small business entity status 
we have seen an increase in solicitations aimed at small businesses  however we continue to look for new ways to increase our sub prime contractor relationships with small firms to bring more value to the customer 
in addition  contract capacity was reached on one of our u 
s army corp of engineers contracts  however we have been positioned for the re competition on that contract for more than a year and anticipate that it will be released soon 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million or compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily driven by a significant write off of an uncollected receivables accounts of approximately million  however it was partially off set due to an increase in overhead expenses for staff salaries and corresponding increase in revenue to compensate for certain stop work orders  and other contract award delays 
additionally  due to delays in certain contract awards a greater portion of direct labor was absorbed as indirect expense 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross revenue for fiscal year was million  an increase of compared to million during the fiscal year 
this increase was primarily the result of the addition of staff to certain joint bases to manage increased responsibilities 
the dod at these locations is charged with managing extensive resources across military services and has turned to versar for assistance because of our strong reputation for on site employee care and customer responsiveness 
as discussed above  we have changed the method of allocating overhead to the reportable segments and have recast previous year information to conform to the revised methodology 
under our revised methodology  gross profit for this segment increased million  or  to million in fy  compared to million in fy although the dollar values changed under the revised methodology  the direction of the fluctuation and the corresponding explanation have remained consistent 
during fiscal year there was an increase in the volume of work without an equivalent increase in off site staffing levels during the current period 
the us army budget cuts precipitated higher operational expectations with lower margins 
further  offsetting any resulting gross margin improvement was our investment in market diversification efforts and in the training and development of existing staff on new management systems during the period 
gross revenue by client base our business segments provide services to various industries  serving government and commercial clients 
a summary of gross revenue from continuing operations generated from our client base is as follows for the years ended june  june  july  in thousands government dod    state local    epa    other    commercial    gross revenue   liquidity and capital resources our working capital as of june  was approximately million  an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition  our current ratio at june  was compared to from the prior fiscal year 
as discussed in note m debt and note t subsequent event  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k  we have a line of credit facility with united bank 
on september  the line of credit facility was modified to extend its maturity date to september  and to make certain other changes to the terms and conditions governing the line of credit 
we did not draw on the line of credit during fiscal year during fiscal year  we had total borrowings and repayments of million 
accordingly  we had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit at june  or june  we financed a portion of our fiscal year acquisition of charron through seller notes totaling million 
at june  the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the notes was 
million 
additionally  in fiscal year we financed a portion of the acquisitions of pps and advent through seller notes totaling approximately million 
at june  no amounts were outstanding under the pps and advent notes 
we believe that in light of our cash balance of million at the end of fiscal year  along with anticipated cash flows from operations and availability under our extended line of credit  our working capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs within the next fiscal year 
expected capital requirements for fiscal year are approximately to million  to be used primarily for annual hardware and software purchases to maintain our existing information technology systems  equipment related to our military munitions response programs  and upgrades to our personal protective equipment manufacturing 
these capital requirements will be funded through existing working capital 
our current growth strategy involves growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses as well as businesses that would diversify our current service offerings 
in order to fund future acquisitions  we may need to supplement our existing working capital and borrowing capacity under our line of credit with additional financing in the form of debt or equity 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available in a timely manner on terms acceptable to us or at all when acquisition opportunities arise 
on september   we announced our acquisition of geo marine  inc  a business with more than million in annual revenues 
the purchase price was paid with a combination of cash and seller notes 
geo marine  headquartered in plano  texas  provides engineering design  construction management  environmental planning and programming  and other services in support of a wide range of government  industry  and commercial clients 
key long term clients that transition with the acquisition include the us navy  the us air force and the us army corps of engineers 
contractual obligations at june   we had total contractual obligations of approximately million  including short term obligations of approximately million 
the short term obligations will become due over the next twelve months fiscal year 
our contractual obligations are primarily related to lease commitments 
additionally  we have principal and interest obligations related to the notes payable from our acquisition of charron 
the table below specifies the total contractual payment obligations as of june  contractual obligations total within year years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations    notes payable to sellers estimated interest obligations total contractual obligations    critical accounting policies and related estimates that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial position and results of operations which require management judgments and estimates  or involve uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
revenue recognition on cost plus fee contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned  and on time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
we record income from fixed price contracts  extending over more than one accounting period  using the percentage of completion method 
during the performance of such contracts  estimated final contract prices and costs are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
fixed price contracts can be significantly impacted by changes in contract performance  contract delays  liquidated damages and penalty provisions  and contract change orders  which may affect the revenue recognition on a project 
revisions to such estimates are made when they become known 
detailed quarterly project reviews are conducted with project managers to review all project progress accruals and revenue recognition 
there is the possibility that there will be future and currently unforeseeable adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and margins for fixed price contracts  particularly in the later stages of these contracts 
such adjustments are common in the construction industry given the nature of the contracts 
these adjustments could either positively or negatively impact our estimates due to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations of change orders  the impact of schedule slippage  subcontractor claims and contract disputes which are normally resolved at the end of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts disputes arise in the normal course of our business on projects where we are contesting with customers for collection of funds because of events such as delays  changes in contract specifications and questions of cost allowability and collectability 
such disputes  whether claims or unapproved change orders in process of negotiation  are recorded at the lesser of their estimated net realizable value or actual costs incurred and only when realization is probable and can be reliably estimated 
management reviews outstanding receivables on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for reserves  taking into consideration past collection history and other events that bear on the collectability of such receivables 
all receivables over days old are reviewed as part of this process 
share based compensation share based compensation is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award 
the majority of the company equity awards granted in fiscal years   and were restricted stock unit awards 
share based compensation cost for restricted stock unit awards is based on the fair market value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation cost for stock options is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of stock options  as calculated using the black scholes pricing model 
net deferred tax asset we have approximately million in net deferred tax assets as of june   for continuing operations 
these deferred tax assets are comprised of tax benefits associated with accrued expenses  reserves and employee benefits and are offset against deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation and amortization 
we expect these net deferred tax assets to be fully utilized except for net operating loss carry forwards from our philippine branch in the amount of  for which  consistent with prior years  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
we review the cash flows of the operating units to ensure the carrying values do not exceed the cash flows that they support 
any write downs are treated as permanent reductions 
we believe our long lived assets as of june  are fully realizable 
goodwill the carrying value of goodwill at june  and june  was million and million  respectively 
the goodwill balances were principally generated from our fiscal year acquisition of charron and our acquisitions of pps and advent 
in performing the goodwill impairment analysis  management utilized a market based valuation approach 
we have elected to perform the annual goodwill impairment assessment on the last day of each fiscal year 
as part of the impairment assessment  public companies and discounted cash flow analyses were performed to prepare a market based valuation 
based upon the analysis  the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the net assets as of june  accordingly  the goodwill impairment test for fiscal year concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired 
should the financial performance of the reporting units not meet estimates  then impairment of goodwill would have to be further assessed to determine whether a write down of goodwill value would be warranted 
if such a write down were to occur  it would negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
however  it would not impact our cash flow or financial debt covenants 
intangible assets the net carrying value of our intangible assets at june  and june  was million and million  respectively 
the intangible assets include customer related assets  marketing related assets  and technology based assets 
these intangible assets are amortized over a year useful life 
we review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
any impairments of the asset are treated as permanent reductions 
we believe that our intangible assets were not impaired during fiscal years or asset retirement obligation the company has recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with the commencing clean up costs for the discontinued operations of the lab that resides in the operations of the ecm segment 
this obligation represents the estimated costs to clean up the laboratory and return it to its original state 
at june  and june   the asset retirement obligation was approximately million 
the asset retirement obligation is included in the other current liabilities line item in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
impact of inflation we protect ourselves from the effects of inflation 
the majority of contracts we perform are for a period of a year or less and are firm fixed price contracts 
multi year contracts provide for projected increases in labor and other costs 
business segments we have the following three business segments ecm  esg  and psg 
additional details regarding these segments are contained in note b business segments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any transactions using derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and other relevant market risk is not material
