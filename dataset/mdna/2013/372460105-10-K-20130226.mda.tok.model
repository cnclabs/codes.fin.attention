in  the company conducted business throughout the united states  canada  mexico and puerto rico from approximately  locations 
we recorded consolidated net sales of billion for the year ended december   an increase of compared to billion in consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million  up from million in the company s internal growth initiatives and effective cost management  which we discuss further below  served to drive our solid financial performance for the year  despite the slowing industry trends across our businesses as the year progressed 
the sales growth in follows an increase in revenues in both and our increase in net income follows a increase in net income in and throughout the two year period preceding  we experienced strong and steady growth in three of our four business segments  as conditions in these industries improved significantly from the depressed levels experienced in these favorable conditions began to moderate following the first quarter of  which created a more challenging sales environment over the balance of the year 
over the three year period of through  our financial performance was also positively impacted by a variety of initiatives we implemented to grow sales and earnings in each of our four businesses 
examples of such initiatives include strategic acquisitions  the introduction of new and expanded product lines  geographic expansion  sales to new markets  enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives 
we discuss these initiatives further below 
with regard to the december  consolidated balance sheet  the company s cash balance of million was down from cash of million at december   due primarily to two investments in our automotive business during  which are discussed further under liquidity and capital resources

acquisitions in our automotive and electrical businesses contributed to our sales growth and increased sales volume added approximately to sales 
the impact of product inflation varied by business  as  cumulatively  prices in were flat in the automotive segment  up approximately in the industrial segment  flat in the electrical segment and up approximately in the office segment 
the company is well positioned to improve sales again in consolidated net sales for the year ended december  totaled billion  an increase from the company showed sales growth in all four of our business segments in the increase in total sales volume for the year added approximately to sales  while acquisitions and the effect of currency associated with our canadian and mexican businesses each contributed as well

automotive group net sales for the automotive group automotive were billion in  an increase of from the increase in sales for the year was primarily due to the may  acquisition of quaker city motor parts co 
quaker city  which contributed approximately to sales 
additionally  automotive achieved a positive comparable store sales increase of slightly more than 
automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation or the effect of currency associated with our canadian and mexican businesses 
in  automotive revenues were up in the first quarter  then up in the second quarter  up in the third quarter and up in the fourth quarter 
we believe that the underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket  including the overall aging of the vehicle populations  remain solid and will serve to drive increased demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items in based on these fundamentals and the internal growth initiatives in our automotive business  we expect to grow our sales for this group again in net sales for automotive were billion in  an increase of from sales improved in due primarily to positive comparable stores sales growth of approximately 
other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include higher transaction value associated with product inflation  which contributed approximately  and the effect of currency associated with our canadian and mexican businesses  which positively impacted sales by approximately 
automotive revenues were up in the first  second and third quarters  and were up in the fourth quarter

higher transaction values in associated with product inflation added another to sales 
there was no material impact on sales from acquisitions and no effect of currency associated with our canadian business  as in the prior year 
the relative steadiness in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by industrial was evidenced by sustained levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization for the year  overall  which this group tends to track 
these indices did  however  show some slowing over the second half of relative to the first half 
consistent with this trend  industrial revenues were up in the first quarter of  up in the second quarter  then up and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
we anticipate a stable manufacturing environment in the near term and this will provide us opportunities to grow our industrial business in net sales for industrial  were billion in  an increase of compared to factors contributing to the sales increase for this group include the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives  which drove sales volumes up approximately

industrial revenues were up in the first quarter of  up in the second quarter  then up and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
office group net sales for s 
p 
richards  our office products group office  were billion in  flat with revenues in the industry wide slowdown in office products consumption  which continues to pressure this segment  reflects the ongoing elevated levels of white collar unemployment  which the industry tends to track 
in addition  other industry trends such as the declining demand for paper and paper based office products are negatively impacting the office products industry 
overall  sales volume in office declined by for the year  offset by higher transaction values associated with price inflation of approximately 
sales decreased by in the first  second and third quarters  and were up in the fourth quarter of we expect to improve our sales volumes in  as the economy recovers further and white collar unemployment declines 
net sales for office were billion in  up from office revenues began to stabilize in relative to prior year trends  and this group was able to make further progress in higher transaction values due to product inflation of approximately contributed to our sales growth 
we were also pleased to report a increase in sales volume for this business  despite the ongoing difficult environment for the office products industry  which we attribute to the generally slow recovery of white collar employment levels in the us sales increased approximately  and in the first  second and third quarters  respectively  and were down in the fourth quarter of electrical group net sales for eis  our electrical and electronic group electrical  increased to million in  up from the increase in revenues is due primarily to acquisitions  which contributed approximately to our sales growth in a decrease in sales volume and a negative impact from copper pricing for the year served to offset this increase 
electrical s customer base experienced slightly weaker manufacturing expansion during the year  as measured by the institute for supply management s purchasing managers index 
sales for electrical increased by in the first quarter  and were up in the second quarter  up in the third quarter and were down in the fourth quarter 
based on the underlying assumption for stronger manufacturing expansion in  the company currently anticipates another year of reasonable growth in the electrical business 
net sales for electrical increased to million in  up from acquisitions contributed approximately to electrical s sales growth  and the effect of copper pricing had a positive sales impact for the year 
the increase in sales volume  supported by continued manufacturing expansion during the year  contributed to sales in and product inflation  which resulted in higher transaction values  added another to sales 
electrical sales increased by in the first quarter  followed by increases of in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
cost of goods sold the company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise  which represents the vast majority of this line item 
other costs in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and in bound freight from the supplier  net of any vendor allowances and incentives 
cost of goods sold was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of goods sold from to is directly related to the sales increase for the same period  as actual costs remained steady 
cost of goods sold represented of net sales in  of net sales in and of net sales in the slight decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for reflects our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies  promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs 
in  these initiatives were offset by the negative impact of certain pricing adjustments implemented in automotive as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures in the industrial and office businesses  hence the lower gross margin level in when compared to in  only the industrial and office business segments experienced vendor price increases 
in the previous two years  all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases although  in  the automotive and office increases were relatively immaterial 
in any year where we experience price increases  we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 
operating expenses the company includes in selling  administrative and other expenses sg a  all personnel and personnel related costs at its headquarters  distribution centers and stores  which accounts for approximately of total sg a

a slight increase in gross margin also positively impacted their operating margin 
automotive s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 
automotive s operating margin increased to in from in the improvement in operating margin for is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with automotive s sales increase for the year 
industrial group industrial s operating margin decreased to in from in the decrease in operating margin in is due to the combination of reduced expense leverage associated with slower sales growth relative to the prior year and the decline in volume incentives for the year

industrial will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 
industrial s operating margin increased to in from in the increase in operating margin in was due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a sales increase  cost savings and increased volume incentives 
office group office s operating margin has been relatively steady over the last three years  at in  in and in in each of these three periods  the cost savings measures in the office segment were somewhat offset by the ongoing gross margin pressures associated with the slow demand for office products across the industry

electrical group electrical s operating margin increased to in from in the increase in operating margin in is primarily due to the positive impact of effective cost management as well as an improved gross margin 
the improvement in gross margin reflects several factors  including higher margin business associated with recent acquisitions  and the decrease in copper prices during the year  which generally do not affect profit dollars  but positively impact margins  as the standard industry practice is to bill copper to the customer at cost

we have million of total debt outstanding at december   of which million matures in november and million matures in november in addition  the company entered into a syndicated facility agreement the syndicated facility for million in september  which replaced the million unsecured revolving line of credit that was scheduled to mature in december no amounts were outstanding under the syndicated facility or line of credit at december  and  respectively 
the capital and credit markets were volatile over the last few years  although these conditions did not materially impact our access to these markets 
currently  we believe that our cash on hand and available short term and long term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company s operations  including working capital requirements  scheduled debt payments  interest payments  capital expenditures  benefit plan contributions  income tax obligations  dividends  share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   and  before consideration of current debt outstanding at december   the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to this compares to to at december  our liquidity position remains solid

notes and other borrowings the company maintains an million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions  which matures in september and bears interest at libor plus a margin  which is based on the company s leverage ratio at december  
the company also has the option under this agreement to increase its borrowing an additional million  as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the syndicated facility with appropriate notice 
at december  and  no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit 
due to the workers compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states  the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately million and million outstanding at december  and  respectively 
at december   the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under a million financing arrangement as follows million series c senior unsecured note  fixed  due  and million series d and e senior unsecured notes  fixed  due these borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings

therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates 
the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company s guarantee 
to date  the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings 
the following table shows the company s approximate commercial commitments as of december  other commercial commitments total amounts committed amount of commitment expiration per period less than year years years over years in thousands line of credit standby letters of credit guaranteed borrowings of independents and affiliates total commercial commitments in addition  the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
contributions in were million 
we expect to make a million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in  and contributions required for and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations 
share repurchases in  the company repurchased approximately million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately million shares at december  critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements  including our revised interpretation relating to accounting for potential sales returns of automotive parts 
inventories provisions for slow moving and obsolescence the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs 
while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future  its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience 
this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed  a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and  therefore  the need to revise estimates for bad debts 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
consideration received from vendors the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives 
generally  the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria 
the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year 
while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in and beyond  there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 
impairment of property  plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually  the company evaluates property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
the company s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance  among other factors 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
employee benefit plans the company s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company s pension plan assets 
the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company s management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada  as well as fiduciary standards 
the long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk  protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan s actuarially assumed long term rate of return 
the company s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark s p index  russell mid cap index  russell index  msci eafe index  dj global moderate index and barcap us govt credit 
we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense 
we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases  mortality rates  retirement patterns and turnover rates 
based on the investment policy for the pension plans  as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company s asset allocations and future expectations  the company s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring pension expense or income is for the plans 
the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company s benefit obligations  using capital market data and historical relationships 
the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date 
we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate 
based upon this cash flow matching analysis  we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of at december  net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in pension cost in from was primarily due to the curtailment gain recorded in connection with the amendment to the us defined benefit pension plan  offset by the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate 
the increase in pension cost in from reflects the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases 
the amendment and related curtailment decreased benefit costs in and are discussed further below 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 
in december  the company s us defined benefit plan was amended to reflect a hard freeze as of december  no further benefits will be provided after that date for additional credited service or earnings and all participants will become fully vested as of december  the company recorded a million non cash curtailment gain in december in connection with this amendment 
quarterly results of operations the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and three months ended march  june  sept 
 dec 
 in thousands except per share data net sales gross profit net income earnings per share basic diluted net sales gross profit net income earnings per share basic diluted we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period 
as a result  the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 
the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements 
specifically  the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts  inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned  among others 
bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales  and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels 
inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual september and october book to physical inventory adjustments 
the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end 
the effect of these adjustments in and was not significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices  the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
foreign currency the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes 
the company s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar  which is the functional currency of our canadian operations 
foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian dollar and  to a lesser extent  the mexican peso  negatively impacted our results for the year ended december  during and  it was estimated that a shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately million and million  respectively
