item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for scana and sce g 
should the construction of the new units materially and adversely deviate from the schedules  estimates  and projections submitted to and approved by the scpsc pursuant to the blra  the scpsc could disallow the additional capital costs that result from the deviations to the extent that it is deemed that the company failure to anticipate or avoid the deviation  or to minimize the resulting expenses  was imprudent  considering the information available at the time 
depending upon the magnitude of any such disallowed capital costs  the company could be moved to evaluate the prudency of continuation  adjustment to  or termination of the new units project 
furthermore  jointly owned projects  such as the current construction of the new units  are subject to the risk that one or more of the joint owners becomes either unable or unwilling to continue to fund project financial commitments  new joint owners cannot be secured at equivalent financial terms  or changes in the joint ownership make up will increase project costs and or delay the completion 
to the extent that delays occur  costs become unrecoverable  or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected 

table of contents the use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints 
the company and consolidated sce g do not fully hedge against financial market risks or price changes in commodities 
this could result in increased costs  thereby resulting in lower margins and adversely affecting results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the company and consolidated sce g use derivative instruments  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  to manage our commodity and financial market risks 
we could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities and interest rate contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
the company strives to manage commodity price exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie  to hedge our exposure to demand  market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices 
we do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility 
to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility or our hedges are not effective  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition may be diminished 
furthermore  recent federal legislation dodd frank affects the use and reporting of derivative instruments 
the regulations under this new legislation provide for substantial additional regulation of over the counter and security based derivative instruments  among other things  and require numerous rule makings by the cftc and the sec to implement 
although the company and consolidated sce g have determined that they meet the end user exception of dodd frank  with the lowest level of required regulatory reporting burden imposed by this law  we cannot predict when the final regulations will be issued or what requirements they will impose 
changing and complex laws and regulations to which the company and consolidated sce g are subject could adversely affect revenues  increase costs  or curtail activities  thereby adversely impacting results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the company and consolidated sce g operate under the regulatory authority of the united states government and its various regulatory agencies  including the ferc  nrc  sec  irs  epa  cftc and phmsa 
in addition  the company and consolidated sce g are subject to regulation by the state governments of south carolina  north carolina and georgia via regulatory agencies  state environmental commissions  and state employment commissions 
accordingly  the company and consolidated sce g must comply with extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations 
such governmental oversight and regulation broadly and materially affect the operation of our business 
in addition to many other aspects of our business  these requirements impact the licensing  siting  construction and operation of facilities 
they affect our management of safety  the reliability of our electric and natural gas transmission systems  the physical and cyber security of key assets  customer conservation through demand side management programs  information security  the issuance of securities and borrowing of money  financial reporting  interactions among affiliates  the payment of dividends and employment programs and practices 
changes to governmental regulations are continual  and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on the company s or consolidated sce g s businesses 
furthermore  uncertainty in monetary  fiscal  or regulatory policies of the federal government may adversely affect the debt and equity markets and the economic climate for the nation  region or particular industries  such as ours or those of our customers 
the company and consolidated sce g are subject to extensive rate regulation which could adversely affect operations 
large capital projects and or increases in operating costs may lead to requests for regulatory relief  such as rate increases  which may be denied  in whole or part  by rate regulators 
rate increases may also result in reductions in customer usage of electricity or gas  legislative action and lawsuits 
sce g s electric operations in south carolina and the company s gas distribution operations in south carolina and north carolina are regulated by state utilities commissions 
in addition  the construction of the new units by sce g is subject to rate regulation by the scpsc via the blra 
the company s interstate gas pipeline  sce g s electric transmission system and consolidated sce g s generating facilities are subject to extensive regulation and oversight from the ferc  nrc and scpsc 
our gas marketing operations in georgia are subject to state regulatory oversight and  for a portion of its operations  to rate regulation 
there can be no assurance that georgia s gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as market conditions evolve 
although we believe that we have constructive relationships with the regulators  our ability to obtain rate treatment that will allow us to maintain reasonable rates of return is dependent upon regulatory determinations  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement rate adjustments when sought 

table of contents the company and consolidated sce g are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require significant capital expenditures  can increase our costs of operations and may impact our business plans or expose us to environmental liabilities 
the company and consolidated sce g are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to water quality and air emissions such as reducing nitrogen oxide  sulfur dioxide  mercury and particulate matter 
some form of regulation may be forthcoming at the federal  and possibly state  levels to impose regulatory requirements specifically directed at reducing ghg emissions from fossil fuel fired electric generating units 
a number of bills have been introduced in congress that seek to require ghg emissions reductions from fossil fuel fired electric generation facilities  natural gas facilities and other sectors of the economy  although none have yet been enacted 
on february   the epa issued the finalized mats for power plants that requires reduced emissions from new and existing coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating facilities 
the epa has proposed requirements for cooling water intake structures to meet bact  and the epa presently is drafting a final rule regarding the handling of coal ash and other combustion by products produced by power plant operations 
furthermore  the epa has announced that it expects to overhaul the cwa rules governing effluent limitation standards for coal fired power plants 
compliance with these environmental laws and regulations requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring  installation of pollution control equipment  emissions fees and permitting at our facilities 
these expenditures have been significant in the past and are expected to continue or even increase in the future 
changes in compliance requirements or more restrictive interpretations by governmental authorities of existing requirements may impose additional costs on us such as the clean up of mgp sites or additional emission allowances or require us to incur additional capital expenditures or curtail some of our cost savings activities such as the recycling of fly ash and other coal combustion products for beneficial use 
compliance with any ghg emission reduction requirements  including any mandated renewable portfolio standards  also may impose significant costs on us  and the resulting price increases to our customers may lower customer consumption 
such costs of compliance with environmental regulations could negatively impact our industry  our business and our results of operations and financial position  especially if emissions or discharge limits are reduced or more onerous permitting requirements or additional regulatory requirements are imposed 
renewable and or alternative electric generation portfolio standards may be enacted at the federal or state level 
some states already have them  though currently south carolina does not 
such standards could direct us to build or otherwise acquire generating capacity derived from renewable alternative energy sources generally  renewable energy such as biomass  solar  wind and tidal  and excluding fossil fuels  nuclear or hydro facilities 
such renewable alternative energy may not be readily available in our service territories  if at all  and could be extremely costly to build  acquire  and operate 
resulting increases in the price of electricity to recover the cost of these types of generation  if approved by regulatory commissions  could result in lower usage of electricity by our customers 
although we cannot predict whether such standards will be adopted at the federal level or in south carolina or their specifics if adopted  compliance with such potential portfolio standards could significantly impact our industry  our capital expenditures  and our results of operations and financial position 
the compliance costs of these environmental laws and regulations are important considerations in the company and consolidated se g strategic planning and  as a result  significantly affect the decisions to construct  operate  and retire facilities  including generating facilities 
the company and consolidated sce g are vulnerable to interest rate increases  which would increase our borrowing costs  and may not have access to capital at favorable rates  if at all 
additionally  potential disruptions in the capital and credit markets may further adversely affect the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet long term commitments  each could in turn adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the company and consolidated sce g rely on the capital markets  particularly for publicly offered debt and equity  as well as the banking and commercial paper markets  to meet our financial commitments and short term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations 
changes in interest rates affect the cost of borrowing 
the company s and consolidated sce g s business plans  which include significant investments in energy generation and other internal infrastructure projects  reflect the expectation that we will have access to the capital markets on satisfactory terms to fund commitments 
moreover  the ability to maintain short term liquidity by utilizing commercial paper programs is dependent upon maintaining satisfactory short term debt ratings and the existence of a market for our commercial paper generally 
the company s and consolidated sce g s ability to draw on our respective bank revolving credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments and on our ability to timely renew such facilities 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the company or consolidated 
table of contents sce g if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time 
longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business 
any disruption could require the company and consolidated sce g to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures or other discretionary uses of cash 
disruptions in capital and credit markets also could result in higher interest rates on debt securities  limited or no access to the commercial paper market  increased costs associated with commercial paper borrowing or limitations on the maturities of commercial paper that can be sold if at all  increased costs under bank credit facilities and reduced availability thereof  and increased costs for certain variable interest rate debt securities of the company and consolidated sce g 
disruptions in the capital markets and its actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy also adversely affect the value of the investments held within scana s pension trust 
a significant long term decline in the value of these investments may require us to make or increase contributions to the trust to meet future funding requirements 
in addition  a significant decline in the market value of the investments may adversely impact the company s and consolidated sce g s results of operations  cash flows and financial position  including its shareholders equity 
a downgrade in the credit rating of scana or any of scana s subsidiaries  including sce g  could negatively affect our ability to access capital and to operate our businesses  thereby adversely affecting results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
various rating agencies rate scana s long term senior unsecured debt  sce g s long term senior secured debt  and the long term senior unsecured debt of psnc energy as investment grade 
in addition  ratings agencies maintain ratings on the short term debt of scana  sce g  fuel company which ratings are based upon the guarantee of sce g and psnc energy 
if these rating agencies were to lower the outlook or downgrade any of these ratings  particularly to below investment grade  borrowing cost on new issuances would increase  which would diminish financial results  and the potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease 
in  one rating agency downgraded both the short term and senior unsecured long term debt of scana 
these downgrades have increased scana s short term borrowing rate and  consequently  have decreased the average maturity of its short term debt  and may have the effect of increasing scana s long term borrowing rate 
although access to the short term market has not been adversely impacted  this could change under different market conditions 
scana s leverage ratio of long and short term debt to capital was approximately at december  scana has publicly announced its desire to return its leverage ratio to levels between and  but scana s ability to achieve and maintain those levels depends on a number of factors 
in the future  if scana is not able to maintain its leverage ratio within the desired range  the company s debt ratings may be affected  it may be required to pay higher interest rates on its long and short term indebtedness  and its access to the capital markets may be limited 
operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters  man made mishaps and abnormal weather 
the company has delivered less gas and received lower prices for natural gas in deregulated markets when weather conditions have been milder than normal  and as a consequence earned less income from those operations 
during  the scpsc approved sce g s implementation of an ewna on a pilot basis 
mild weather in the future could diminish the revenues and results of operations and harm the financial condition of the company and consolidated sce g if the ewna is not extended on a permanent basis 
in addition  for the company and consolidated sce g  severe weather can be destructive  causing outages and property damage  adversely affecting operating expenses and revenues 
natural disasters such as electromagnetic events and the earthquake and tsunami in japan or man made mishaps such as the san bruno  california natural gas transmission pipeline failure or the kingston  tennessee coal ash pond failure could have direct significant impacts on the company and consolidated sce g and on our key contractors and suppliers or could indirectly impact us through changes to federal  state or local policies  laws and regulations  and have a significant impact on our financial position  operating expenses  and cash flows 
potential competitive changes may adversely affect our gas and electricity businesses due to the loss of customers  reductions in revenues  or write down of stranded assets 
the utility industry has been undergoing structural change for a number of years  resulting in increasing competitive pressures on electric and natural gas utility companies 
competition in wholesale power sales has been introduced on a national 
table of contents level 
some states have also mandated or encouraged competition at the retail level 
increased competition may create greater risks to the stability of utility earnings generally and may in the future reduce earnings from retail electric and natural gas sales 
in a deregulated environment  formerly regulated utility companies that are not responsive to a competitive energy marketplace may suffer erosion in market share  revenues and profits as competitors gain access to their customers 
in addition  the company s and consolidated sce g s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risk in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  a write down in the value of the related assets would be required 
the company and sce g are subject to risks associated with changes in business and economic climate which could adversely affect revenues  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition and could limit access to capital 
sales  sales growth and customer usage patterns are dependent upon the economic climate in the service territories of the company and sce g  which may be affected by regional  national or even international economic factors 
some economic sectors important to our customer base may be particularly affected 
adverse events  economic or otherwise  may also affect the operations of key customers 
such events may result in the loss of customers  in changes in customer usage patterns and in the failure of customers to make timely payments to us 
with respect to the company  such events also could adversely impact the results of operations through the recording of a goodwill impairment 
the success of local and state governments in attracting new industry to our service territories is important to our sales and growth in sales  as are stable levels of taxation including property  income or other taxes which may be affected by local  state  or federal budget deficits  adverse economic climates generally or legislative or regulatory actions 
budget cutbacks also adversely affect funding levels of federal and state support agencies and non profit organizations that assist low income customers with bill payments 
in addition  conservation and demand side management efforts and or technological advances may cause or enable customers to significantly reduce their usage of the company s and sce g s products and adversely affect sales  sales growth  and customer usage patterns 
factors that generally could affect our ability to access capital include economic conditions and our capital structure 
much of our business is capital intensive  and achievement of our capital plan and long term growth targets is dependent  at least in part  upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive 
if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained  our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition and future results of operations could be significantly harmed 
problems with operations could cause us to curtail or limit our ability to serve customers or cause us to incur substantial costs  thereby adversely impacting revenues  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
critical processes or systems in the company s or consolidated sce g s operations could become impaired or fail from a variety of causes  such as equipment breakdown  transmission line failure  information systems failure or security breach  the effects of drought including reduced water levels on the operation of emission control or other generation equipment  and the effects of a pandemic or terrorist attack on our workforce or facilities or on the ability of vendors and suppliers to maintain services key to our operations 
in particular  as the operator of power generation facilities  many of which entered service prior to and may be difficult to maintain  consolidated sce g could incur problems  such as the breakdown or failure of power generation or emission control equipment  transmission equipment  or other equipment or processes which would result in performance below assumed levels of output or efficiency 
in addition  any such breakdown or failure may result in consolidated sce g purchasing emission allowances or replacement power at market rates  if such allowances and replacement power are available at all 
these purchases are subject to state regulatory prudency reviews for recovery through rates 
if replacement power is not available  such problems could result in interruptions of service blackout or brownout conditions in all or part of sce g s territory or elsewhere in the region 
similarly  a gas transmission or distribution line failure of the company or consolidated sce g could affect the safety of the public  destroy property  and interrupt our ability to serve customers 
events such as these could entail substantial repair costs  litigation  fines and penalties  and damage to reputation  each of which could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues  results of operations  and financial condition 
a failure of the company to maintain the physical and cyber security of its operations may result in the failure of operations  damage to equipment  or loss of information  and could result in a significant adverse impact to the company financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents the company depends on maintaining the physical and cyber security of its operations and assets 
as much of our business is part of the nation critical infrastructure  the loss or impairment of the assets associated with that portion of our business could have serious adverse impacts on the customers and communities that we serve 
virtually all of the company operations are dependent in some manner upon our cyber systems  which encompass electric and gas transmission and distribution operations  nuclear and fossil fuel generating plants  human resource and customer systems and databases  information system networks  and systems containing confidential corporate information 
such cyber systems are a target of malicious cyber attacks 
a successful physical or cyber attack could lead to outages  failure of operations of all or portions of our businesses  damage to key components and equipment  and exposure of confidential customer  employee  or corporate information 
the company may not be readily able to recover from such events 
in addition  the failure to secure our operations from such physical and cyber events may cause us reputational damage 
litigation  penalties and claims from a number of parties  including customers  regulators and shareholders  may ensue 
insurance may not be adequate to respond to these events 
as a result  the company financial position  results of operations  and cash flows may be adversely affected 
scana s ability to pay dividends and to make payments on scana s debt securities may be limited by covenants in certain financial instruments and by the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries  thereby adversely impacting the valuation of our common stock and our access to capital 
we are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries 
our assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries 
therefore  our ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt and to pay dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses depends on the earnings  cash flows  financial condition and capital requirements of our subsidiaries  and the ability of our subsidiaries  principally consolidated sce g  psnc energy and semi  to pay dividends or to repay funds to us 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may also be limited by existing or future covenants limiting the right of our subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common stock 
any significant reduction in our payment of dividends in the future may result in a decline in the value of our common stock 
such a decline in value could limit our ability to raise debt and equity capital 
a significant portion of consolidated sce g s generating capacity is derived from nuclear power  the use of which exposes us to regulatory  environmental and business risks 
these risks could increase our costs or otherwise constrain our business  thereby adversely impacting our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
these risks will increase as the new units are developed 
in  summer station unit  operated by sce g  provided approximately million mwh  or of our generation 
if the new units are completed  our generating capacity and the percentage of total generating capacity represented by nuclear sources is expected to increase 
hence  sce g is subject to various risks of nuclear generation  which include the following the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from a release of radioactive materials in connection with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage  handling and disposal of radioactive materials  limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations or those of others in the united states  the possibility that new laws and regulations could be enacted that could adversely affect the liability structure that currently exists in the united states  uncertainties with respect to procurement of nuclear fuel and the storage of spent nuclear fuel  uncertainties with respect to contingencies if insurance coverage is inadequate  and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their operating lives 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit  or both  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours 
in addition  although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident  if a major incident should occur at a domestic nuclear facility  it could harm our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
a major incident at a nuclear facility 
table of contents anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 
finally  in today s environment  there is a heightened risk of terrorist attack on the nation s nuclear facilities  which has resulted in increased security costs at our nuclear plant 
failure to retain and attract key personnel could adversely affect the company s and consolidated sce g s operations and financial performance 
we must attract  retain and develop executive officers and other professional  technical and craft employees with the skills and experience necessary to successfully manage  operate and grow our business 
competition for these employees is high  and in some cases we must compete for these employees on a regional or national basis 
we may be unable to attract and retain these personnel 
further  the company s or consolidated sce g s ability to construct or maintain generation or other assets requires the availability of suitable skilled contractor personnel 
we may be unable to obtain appropriate contractor personnel at the times and places needed 
labor disputes with employees or contractors covered by collective bargaining agreements also could adversely affect implementation of our strategic plan and our operational and financial performance 
the company and consolidated sce g are subject to the risk that strategic decisions made by us either do not result in a return of or on invested capital or might negatively impact our competitive position  which can adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows  financial position  and access to capital 
from time to time  the company and consolidated sce g make strategic decisions that may impact our direction with regard to business opportunities  the services and technologies offered to customers or that are used to serve customers  and the generating plant and other infrastructure that form the basis of much of our business 
these strategic decisions may not result in a return of or on our invested capital  and the effects of these strategic decisions may have long term implications that are not likely to be known to us in the short term 
changing political climates and public attitudes may adversely affect the ongoing acceptability of strategic decisions that have been made and  in some cases  previously approved by regulators  to the detriment of the company or consolidated sce g 
over time  these strategic decisions or changing attitudes toward such decisions  which could be adverse to the company s or consolidated sce g s interests  may have a negative effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position  as well as limit our ability to access capital 
the company and consolidated sce g are subject to the reputational risks that may result from a failure to adhere to high standards of compliance with laws and regulations  ethical conduct  operational effectiveness  and safety of employees  customers and the public 
these risks could adversely affect the valuation of our common stock and the company s and consolidated sce g s access to capital 
the company and consolidated sce g are committed to comply with all laws and regulations  to focus on the safety of employees  customers and the public  to maintain the privacy of information related to our customers and employees and to maintain effective communications with the public and key stakeholder groups  particularly during emergencies and times of crisis 
the company and consolidated sce g also are committed to operational excellence and  through our code of conduct and ethics  to maintain high standards of ethical conduct in our business operations 
a failure to meet these commitments may subject the company and consolidated sce g not only to fraud  litigation and financial loss  but also to reputational risk that could adversely affect the valuation of scana s stock  adversely affect the company s and consolidated sce g s access to capital  and result in further regulatory oversight

item legal proceedings certain material environmental and regulatory matters and uncertainties  some of which remain outstanding at december   are described below 
these issues affect the company and  to the extent indicated  also affect consolidated sce g 
in december  the epa issued a final finding that atmospheric concentrations of ghg endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of section a of the caa 
the finding  which became effective in january  enabled the epa to regulate ghg emissions under the caa 
on april   the epa issued a proposed rule to establish an nsps for ghg emissions from fossil fuel fired electric generating units 
if finalized as proposed  this rule would establish performance standards for new and modified generating units  along with emissions guidelines for existing generating units 
this rule would amend the nsps for electric generating units and establish the first nsps for ghg emissions 
essentially  the rule would require all new fossil fuel fired power plants to meet the carbon dioxide emissions profile of a combined cycle natural gas plant 
while most new natural gas plants will not be required to include any new technologies  no new coal plants could be constructed without carbon capture and sequestration capabilities 
the company is evaluating the proposed rule  but cannot predict when the rule will become final  if at all  or what conditions it may impose on the company  if any 
the company expects that any costs incurred to comply with ghg emission requirements will be recoverable through rates 
in  the epa issued the cair  which required the district of columbia and states  including south carolina  to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels 
cair set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nitrogen oxide and beginning in and  respectively  for sulfur dioxide 
sce g and genco determined that additional air quality controls would be needed to meet the cair requirements 
on july  the epa issued the csapr 
this rule replaced cair and the clean air transport rule proposed in july and is aimed at addressing power plant emissions that may contribute to air pollution in other states 
csapr requires states in the eastern united states to reduce power plant emissions  specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
on december   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia issued an order staying csapr and reinstating cair pending resolution of an appeal of csapr 
on august   the court vacated csapr and left cair in place 
the epa petition for rehearing of the court order has been denied 
air quality control installations that sce g and genco have already completed allowed the company to comply with the reinstated cair 
the company will continue to pursue strategies to comply with all applicable environmental regulations 
any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the epa in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates 
in june  the epa issued a final rule for a one hour ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide 
this standard may require some of sce g s smaller coal fired units to reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions to levels to be determined by epa and or dhec 
the costs incurred to comply with this standard are expected to be recovered through rates 
in january  the epa issued a final rule for an annual ambient air quality standard related to particulate matter smaller than or equal in size to microns  significantly revising the existing standard from ug m micrograms per cubic meter to ug m the rule takes effect on march  sce g anticipates that dhec monitors throughout south carolina will indicate compliance with the new standard 
while sce g does not anticipate a significant impact from this new standard  the costs incurred to comply with this new standard  if any  are expected to be recovered through rates 

table of contents in april  the epa rule containing new standards for mercury and other specified air pollutants became effective 
the rule provides up to four years for facilities to meet the standards  and the company evaluation of the rule is ongoing 
the company decision in to retire certain coal fired units or convert them to burn natural gas and its project to build the new units see note to the consolidated financial statements along with other actions are expected to result in the company compliance with the epa rule 
any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the epa in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates 
the epa is conducting an enforcement initiative against the utilities industry related to the nsr provisions and the nsps of the caa 
as part of the initiative  many utilities have received requests for information under section of the caa 
in addition  the doj  on behalf of epa  has taken civil enforcement action against several utilities 
the primary basis for these actions is the assertion by epa that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities at their coal fired power plants constituted major modifications which required the installation of costly bact 
some of the utilities subject to the actions have reached settlement 
to date  sce g and genco have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the current state of continued doj civil enforcement is the subject of industry wide speculation  and it cannot be determined whether the company will be affected by the initiative in the future 
the company believes that any enforcement action relative to its compliance with the caa would be without merit 
the company further believes that installation of equipment responsive to cair previously discussed will mitigate many of the alleged concerns with nsr 
sce g is responsible for four decommissioned mgp sites in south carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals
