item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of securities act  section e of the exchange act  and the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements regarding our expected financial condition  business and financing plans 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a development stage pharmaceutical and medical device company that seeks to in license  develop and commercialize therapeutic products for the treatment of cardiac and renal dysfunction  specifically in the dialysis and non dialysis areas 
we have the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates crmd neutrolin and crmd crmd is a liquid designed to prevent central venous catheter related bloodstream infections  or crbi  and maintenance of catheter patency in central venous catheters initially in hemodialysis catheters 
we were organized as a delaware corporation on july  under the name picton holding company  inc and we changed our corporate name to cormedix inc on january  since our inception  we have had no revenue from product sales 
our operations have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing  licensing product candidates  developing clinical trials for our product candidates  establishing manufacturing for our product candidates and maintaining and improving our patent portfolio 
we have generated significant losses since our inception and we expect to continue to generate losses as we progress towards the commercialization of our lead product candidate crmd neutrolin 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of  because we do not generate revenue from any of our product candidates  our losses will continue as we continue development of our product candidates 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial until at least the planned launching of neutrolin in europe and thereafter  if not successful 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable  if at all 
these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
on february   we sold  shares of our newly created series a non voting convertible preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  for gross proceeds of  an aggregate of  shares of this series a non voting convertible preferred stock was converted to  shares of our common stock on february  during the year ended december   we completed two series of private placements for an aggregate total of  units  each unit consisting of i a one year  aggregate principal amount senior convertible note  convertible into shares of common stock  at a conversion price of per note  and ii a five year redeemable warrant  to purchase  shares of common stock  to certain accredited investors pursuant to a subscription agreement dated september  and november  at an initial exercise price of per share 
we received gross proceeds of  or net proceeds of approximately  from these private placements 
the notes issued have maturity dates of september  as to the units and november  as to the units 
we paid the placement agent for the private placement a total of  in fees and issued it warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares 
the placement agent warrants have the same terms as those issued to the investors 
see notes to the financial statements note in march  we completed our ipo  whereby we sold  units  each unit consisting of two shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock  at per unit resulting in gross proceeds of  and net proceeds to us of  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
all of our convertible notes and accrued interest thereon and all of our outstanding shares of non voting subordinated class a common stock automatically converted into units or common stock upon the completion of the ipo 
we effected a for reverse stock split of our common stock on february  in connection with the ipo 
all shares and per share amounts  except as noted  have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split 
we believe that as a result of our decision in late to focus the majority of our resources  including our research and development efforts primarily on ce mark approval and the commercialization of neutrolin crmd in europe  the net proceeds from the ipo  the net proceeds from our convertible note private placement financing and the gross proceeds from the private placement of our series a non voting convertible preferred stock in february  our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the second quarter of we intend to raise additional funds through various potential sources  such as equity and or debt financings  strategic relationships  or out licensing of our products  however  we can provide no assurances that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
financial operations overview revenue we have not generated any revenue since our inception 
as of december   we have funded our operations primarily through debt financings and the ipo  and our receipt of a total of approximately  from federal grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  a total of approximately  from the sale of our unused net operating losses through the state of new jersey s economic development authority technology business tax certificate transfer program and approximately  from the state of new york s research and development tax credit program 
research and development expense research and development  or r d  expense consists of i internal costs associated with our development activities  ii payments we make to third party contract research organizations  contract manufacturers  investigative sites  and consultants  iii technology and intellectual property license costs  iv manufacturing development costs  v personnel related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation  benefits  travel and related costs for the personnel involved in drug development  vi activities relating to regulatory filings and the advancement of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and vii facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent  facility maintenance  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
all r d is expensed as incurred 
conducting a significant amount of development is central to our business model 
through december   we incurred  in r d expenses since our inception in july product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development  primarily due to the significantly increased size and duration of the clinical trials 
we plan to increase our r d expenses for the foreseeable future in order to complete development of crmd and our earlier stage r d projects 
the following table summarizes the percentages of our r d payments related to our two most advanced product candidates and other projects 
the percentages summarized in the following table reflect payments directly attributable to each development candidate  which are tracked on a project basis 
a portion of our internal costs  including indirect costs relating to our product candidates  are not tracked on a project basis and are allocated based on management s estimate 
year ended period from july  december  inception through december  crmd crmd crmd crmd the process of conducting pre clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate s early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
during the third quarter of  we received a notice from the us food and drug administration  or fda  that our product candidate  neutrolin  had been assigned to the center for drug evaluation and research  or cder 
as a result of this  and given our limited resources  we decided to change our business strategy and focus the majority of our resources on the research and development of neutrolin rather than crmd and to seek regulatory and commercialization approval for neutrolin in europe through a ce mark application rather than pursue fda approval at this time 
during the first half of  we submitted our design dossier to t v s d the european notified body managing our ce mark application 
in the fourth quarter of  we successfully completed our stage audit with t v s d 
we also have successfully completed our stage audit with t v s d which resulted in our receipt of the iso certification from t v s d on october  this certification  which is a stand alone standard developed by the international organization for standardization  is the globally recognized standard that outlines consistent international processes for the design and manufacturing of medical devices  including many supply chain functions such as assembly  packaging  warehousing and distribution 
compliance with iso is often seen as a step towards achieving compliance with european regulatory requirements 
the conformity of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices according to applicable eu standards must be assessed before sale is permitted 
the preferred method to prove conformity is the certification by a notified body of the quality management system according to iso and or iso and iso the result of a positive assessment is the issuance of a certificate of conformity allowing the ce mark and the permission to sell the medical device in the european union 
we anticipate receiving a ce mark approval by the end of the second quarter of if we obtain ce mark approval in europe  we intend to launch neutrolin for the prevention of catheter related bloodstream infections  or crbi and maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis patients in europe during however  we cannot be assured of ce mark approval of neutrolin or the planned commercialization timeline 
we are currently exploring the various methods of launching neutrolin in europe  whether through a distributorship or partnership arrangement  or otherwise  and plan to initially launch in germany 
assuming the receipt of a ce mark and the launch of neutrolin  we intend to meet with the fda to determine the pathway for us approval of neutrolin  which we expect to entail a phase trial 
general and administrative expense general and administrative  or g a  expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs  including stock based compensation expense  for persons serving in our executive  finance and accounting functions 
other g a expense includes facility related costs not otherwise included in r d expense  promotional expenses  costs associated with industry and trade shows  and professional fees for legal services and accounting services 
we expect that our g a expenses will increase if we add personnel and as a result of the reporting obligations applicable to public companies 
from our inception on july  through december   we incurred  of g a expense 
other income other income consists mainly of federal research grants awarded and research and development tax refunds  net of application fees 
from our inception on july  through december   we received  of other income  net of application fees and related filing costs 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on our pre ipo convertible notes up to their automatic conversion into units or common stock upon the completion of the ipo on march   and on our convertible notes issued in september and november  as well as the amortization and write off of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and a charge for the beneficial conversion relating to certain of our convertible notes 
from our inception on july  through december   we received  of interest income through interest bearing savings accounts and incurred  of interest expense  which consists of interest incurred in debt issued to note holders  amortization and write off of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and a beneficial conversion feature charge related to the conversion of certain of our convertible notes 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  r d expense 
r d expense was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to our strategic change of direction during september  which is to focus primarily on ce mark approval for neutrolin in europe 
during the fourth quarter of  we also discontinued the development of crmd  deferiprone and returned the product candidate to the licensor in december our strategic change of direction also resulted in lower clinical research organization  manufacturing and regulatory expenses related to the development of crmd during the second quarter of and lower personnel costs as a result of our chief medical officer cmo transitioning to a part time status and a reduction of salary effective march g a expense 
g a expense was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower compensation and stock based compensation expense as a result of the separation of our former president and chief executive officer in september and the resignation of our chief financial officer chief operating officer in april and lower expenses related to investor relations 
other income 
other income during in the amount of  represented a research and development funding reimbursement from the state of new york research and development tax refund program 
no other income was recognized for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to having lower interest bearing cash balances during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  no interest expense was recognized for the year ended december  the interest expense charges consisted primarily of a beneficial conversion feature charge of  related to the senior convertible notes and warrants we issued in september and november in the aggregate principal amount of  amortization of deferred financing fees of  and accrued interest of  related to the one year senior convertible notes 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as a result of our significant r d expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate product sales revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in july prior to the ipo  we had funded our operations principally with  in convertible notes sold in private placements and  in related party notes  which were also convertible 
all of our convertible notes were automatically converted into  shares of common stock and  units comprised of  shares of common stock and  warrants at an exercise price of 
we received net proceeds of  from the ipo  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses payable by us upon the closing of the ipo on march  additionally  we received a total of approximately  from federal grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program and a total of approximately  from the sale of our unused net operating losses through the state of new jersey s economic development authority technology business tax certificate transfer program and a total of approximately  from qualified r d expenditures refunded to us through the new york state department of taxation and finance under the qualifying emerging technology incentive program 
during the year ended december   we completed two series of private placements for an aggregate total of  units  each unit consisting of i a one year  aggregate principal amount senior convertible note  convertible into shares of common stock  at a conversion price of per note  and ii a five year redeemable warrant  to purchase  shares of common stock  to certain accredited investors pursuant to a subscription agreement dated september  and november  at an initial exercise price of per share 
we received gross proceeds of  or net proceeds of approximately  from these private placements 
the notes issued have maturity dates of september  as to the units and november  as to the units 
on february   we sold  shares of our newly created series a non voting convertible preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  for gross proceeds of  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  the net loss of  for the year ended december  was higher than cash used in operating activities by  the primary reasons for the difference are amortization of debt discount of  noncash stock based compensation charges of  and amortization of deferred financing costs of  primarily due to the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes and warrants we issued  and an increase in accrued expenses of  offset by decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  relating primarily to the collection of other receivables related to the sale of our unused net operating losses through the state of new jersey s economic development authority technology business tax certificate transfer program and accounts payable of  net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  the net loss of  for the year ended december  was higher than cash used in operating activities by  the primary reasons for the difference are non cash stock based compensation charges of  offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively  relating primarily to clinical research organization costs  clinical site costs  manufacturing costs  patent fees and accrued legal fees 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was for the year ended december  a decrease of  for the same period last year due to a purchase of office equipment during the year ended december net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period last year 
the increase was attributable to the gross proceeds from senior convertible notes of  offset by deferred financing costs of funding requirements our total cash on hand as of december  was  compared to  at december  because our business does not generate positive operating cash flow  we will need to raise additional capital before we exhaust our current cash resources in order to continue to fund our research and development  as well as to fund operations generally 
our continued operations will depend on whether we are able to raise additional funds through various potential sources  such as equity  debt financing  strategic relationships  out licensing or distribution arrangements of our products 
through december   all of our financing has been through the issuance of convertible notes in september and november  our ipo  previous debt financings and our receipt of a total of approximately  from federal grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  a total of approximately  from the sale of our unused net operating losses through the state of new jersey s economic development authority technology business tax certificate transfer program and approximately  from the state of new york s research and development tax credit program  net of application fees 
we expect to continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through either capital raising sources as previously described  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders  or through generating revenues from the licensing of our products or strategic alliances 
we plan to seek additional debt and or equity financing  but can provide no assurances that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
moreover  the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with a debt financing would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
our actual cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned  however  because of a number of factors including the changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  the acquisition and pursuit of development of new product candidates  competitive and technical advances  costs of commercializing any of our product candidates  and costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and any other intellectual property rights 
we do not anticipate that we will generate significant product sales revenue for  if any 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several quarters 
based on our cash resources at december   the private placement of our series a non voting convertible preferred stock in february  and our current plan of expenditure on continuing development of neutrolin  we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations into the second quarter of  and will need additional financing until we can achieve profitability  if ever 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development and regulatory approval of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
each of these alternatives would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included with this report  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
stock based compensation we account for stock options according to the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 
 compensation stock compensation asc 
under asc  share based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period on a straight line basis 
we account for stock options granted to non employees on a fair value basis using the black scholes option pricing method in accordance with asc the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting are revalued at the end of each reporting period based upon the change in the fair value of the options and amortized to consulting expense over the related vesting period 
we granted options to purchase  shares of common stock to our employees  non employees and directors and officers during the year ended december  for the purpose of valuing options and warrants granted to our employees  directors and officers during the year ended december   we used the black scholes option pricing model 
for the purpose of valuing performance based options granted to non employees during the year ended december   we used the guidelines in accordance with fasb asc no 
asc  equity based payments to non employees  of which if the performance condition is outside of the control of the non employee  the cost to be recognized is the lowest aggregate fair value prior to the achievement of the performance condition  even if we believe it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
as of december   the performance conditions of such stock options were not achieved  therefore  no non employee stock options vested and no expense was recorded during the period ended december  to determine the risk free interest rate  we utilized the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term consistent with the expected term of our awards 
we estimated the expected term of the options granted based on anticipated exercises in future periods assuming the success of our business model as currently forecasted 
the expected dividend yield reflects our current and expected future policy for dividends on our common stock 
the expected stock price volatility for the stock options was calculated by examining historical volatilities for publicly traded industry peers  since we do not have a significant trading history for our common stock 
we will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions as more historical data for our common stock becomes available 
we have experienced forfeitures of stock options issued to our former employees  officers  directors and board members 
since the stock options currently outstanding are primarily held by our senior management and directors  we will continue to evaluate the effects of such future potential forfeitures  as they may arise  to ascertain an estimated forfeiture rate 
accounting standards updates asus not effective until after december  are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements
