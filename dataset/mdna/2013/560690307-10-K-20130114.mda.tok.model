overview we are a provider of video game products primarily for the family oriented  casual game consumer 
we sell our products primarily to large retail chains  specialty retail stores  video game rental outlets and distributors 
we publish video games for almost all major current generation interactive entertainment hardware platforms  including nintendo s ds  dsi  ds and wii  sony s playstation  or ps  and playstation portable  or psp  microsoft s xbox and the personal computer  or pc 
we also publish games for numerous digital platforms such as xbox live arcade and playstation network  or psn  and mobile platforms such as iphone  ipad and ipod touch  as well as online platforms such as facebook and zynga 
com 
our video game titles are targeted at various demographics at a range of price points 
due to the larger budget requirements for developing and marketing premium console titles for core gamers  we focus on publishing more casual games targeting casual game consumers 
in some instances  our titles are based on licenses of well known properties and  in other cases based on original properties 
we enter into agreements with content providers and video game development studios for the creation of our video games 
our operations involve similar products and customers worldwide 
these products are developed and sold domestically and internationally 
the company is centrally managed and our chief operating decision makers  the chief executive and other officers  use consolidated and other financial information supplemented by sales information by product category  major product title and platform for making operational decisions and assessing financial performance 
accordingly  we operate in a single segment 
net revenues 
our revenues are principally derived from sales of our video games 
we provide video games primarily for the mass market and casual game player 
our revenues are recognized net of estimated provisions for price protection and other allowances 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of product costs and amortization and impairment of software development costs and license fees 
a significant component of our cost of sales is product costs 
product costs are comprised primarily of manufacturing and packaging costs of the disc or cartridge media  royalties to the platform manufacturer and manufacturing and packaging costs of peripherals 
in cases where we act as a distributor for other publishers products  cost of sales may increase as we acquire products at a higher fixed wholesale price 
while the product costs as a percentage of revenue is higher on these products  we do not incur up front development and licensing fees or resulting amortization of software development costs 
commencing upon the related product s release  capitalized software development and intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales 
when  in management s estimate  future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized costs  we expense these capitalized costs to cost of sales loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees future releases 
these expenses may be incurred prior to a game s release 
gross profit 
gross profit is the excess of net revenues over product costs and amortization and impairment of software development and license fees 
development and license fees incurred to produce video games are generally incurred up front and amortized to cost of sales 
the recovery of these costs and total gross profit is dependent upon achieving a certain sales volume  which varies by title 
product research and development expenses 
product research and development expenses relate principally to our cost of supervision of third party video game developers  testing new products  development of social games and conducting quality assurance evaluations during the development cycle that are not allocated to games for which technological feasibility has been established 
costs incurred are primarily employee related  may include equipment  and are not allocated to cost of sales 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist of marketing and promotion expenses  including television advertising  the cost of shipping products to customers and related employee costs 
credits to retailers for trade advertising are a component of these expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily represent employee related costs  including corporate executive and support staff  general office expenses  professional fees and various other overhead charges 
professional fees  including legal and accounting expenses  typically represent the second largest component of our general and administrative expenses 
these fees are partially attributable to our required activities as a publicly traded company  such as sec filings 
loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games 
loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games consists of contract termination costs  and the write off of previously capitalized costs  for games that were cancelled prior to their release to market 
we periodically review our games in development and compare the remaining cost to complete each game to projected future net cash flows expected to be generated from sales 
in cases where we don t expect the projected future net cash flows generated from sales to be sufficient to cover the remaining incremental cash obligation to complete the game  we cancel the game  and record a charge to operating expenses 
while we incur a current period charge on these cancellations  we believe we are limiting the overall loss on a game project that is no longer expected to perform as originally expected due to changing market conditions or other factors 
significant management estimates are required in making these assessments  including estimates regarding retailer and customer interest  pricing  competitive game performance and changing market conditions 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs are directly attributable to our factoring and our purchase order financing arrangements 
such costs include commitment fees and fees based upon the value of customer invoices factored 
income taxes 
income taxes consists of our provision benefit for income taxes and proceeds from the sale of rights to certain net operating loss carryforwards in the state of new jersey 
utilization of our net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of nol carryforwards before utilization 
due to our history of losses  a valuation allowance sufficient to fully offset our nol and other deferred tax assets has been established under current accounting pronouncements  and this valuation allowance will be maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
in fiscal and  we reversed our valuation allowance to the extent of our nols used  and recorded certain alternative minimum taxes and state taxes 
seasonality and variations in interim quarterly results our quarterly net revenues  gross profit and operating income are impacted significantly by the seasonality of the retail selling season  and the timing of the release of new titles 
sales of our catalog and other products are generally higher in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year ending january and october  respectively due to increased retail sales during the holiday season 
sales and gross profit as a percentage of sales also generally increase in quarters in which we release significant new titles because of increased sales volume as retailers make purchases to stock their shelves and meet initial demand for the new release 
these quarters also benefit from the higher selling prices that we are able to achieve early in the product s life cycle 
therefore  sales results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for subsequent quarters during the fiscal year 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our product when risks and rewards of ownership are transferred  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have no continuing obligations to the customer  and the collection of related accounts receivable is probable 
certain products are sold to customers with a street date the earliest date these products may be resold by retailers 
revenue for sales of these products is not recognized prior to their street date 
included in advances from customers and deferred revenue as of october  is deferred revenue of  on sales of products to a distributor with a future street date 
in connection with this deferred revenue  the company has approximately  of deferred cost of sales product included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
some of our software products provide limited online features at no additional cost to the consumer 
generally  we have considered such features to be incidental to our overall product offerings and an inconsequential deliverable 
accordingly  we do not defer any revenue related to products containing these limited online features 
however  in instances where online features or additional functionality is considered a substantive deliverable in addition to the software product  such characteristics will be taken into account when applying our revenue recognition policy 
to date  the company has not earned significant revenues from such features 
in addition  some of our software products are sold exclusively as downloads of digital content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee 
revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 
when we enter into license or distribution agreements that provide for multiple copies of games in exchange for guaranteed amounts  revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the agreements  generally upon delivery of a master copy  assuming our performance obligations are complete and all other recognition criteria are met  or as per copy royalties are earned on sales of games 
we operate hosted online games in which players can play for free and purchase virtual goods for use in the games 
we recognize revenues from the sale of virtual goods as service revenues over the estimated period in which players use the game 
we currently estimate these periods of use to be three to four months 
we will periodically assess our estimates for this period of use and future increases or decreases in these estimates will affect our recognized revenues prospectively 
we also recognize advertising revenue related to advertising placed on our game sites as ads are displayed 
price protection and other allowances 
we generally sell our products on a no return basis  although in certain instances  we provide price protection or other allowances on certain unsold products in accordance with industry practices 
price protection  when granted and applicable  allows customers a partial credit with respect to merchandise unsold by them 
revenue is recognized net of estimates of these allowances 
sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for benefits received  such as the appearance of our products in a customer s national circular advertisement  are generally reflected as selling and marketing expenses 
we estimate potential future product price protection and other discounts related to current period product revenue 
in addition  some of our software products are sold exclusively as downloads of digital content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee 
revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 
our provisions for price protection and other allowances fluctuate over periods as a result of a number of factors including analysis of historical experience  current sell through of retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the interactive entertainment market  the overall economy  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period 
however  actual allowances granted could materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions  technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of requests for allowances may increase as consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  this will result in a change in our provisions  which would impact the net revenues and or selling and marketing expenses we report 
for the month periods ended october   and  we provided allowances for future price protection and other allowances of million  million and million  respectively 
fluctuations in the provisions reflected our estimates of future price protection based on the factors discussed above 
we limit our exposure to credit risk by factoring a portion of our receivables to a third party that buys without recourse 
for receivables that are not sold without recourse  we analyze our aged accounts receivables  payment history and other factors to make a determination if collection of receivables is likely  or a provision for uncollectible accounts is necessary 
capitalized software development costs and license fees 
software development costs include development fees  primarily in the form of milestone payments made to independent software developers 
software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and management expects such costs to be recoverable against future revenues 
for products where proven game engine technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to product research and development costs 
commencing upon a related product s release capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales based upon the higher of i the ratio of current revenue to total projected revenue or ii straight line charges over the expected marketable life of the product 
prepaid license fees represent license fees to holders for the use of their intellectual property rights in the development of our products 
minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property licenses are initially recorded as an asset capitalized license fees and a current liability accrued royalties payable at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract or when specified milestones or events occur and when no significant performance commitment remains with the licensor 
licenses are expensed to cost of sales at the higher of i the contractual royalty rate based on actual sales or ii an effective rate based upon total projected revenue related to such license 
capitalized software development costs are classified as non current if they relate to titles for which we estimate the release date to be more than one year from the balance sheet date 
non current costs amounted to and as of october  and  respectively 
the amortization period for capitalized software development costs and license fees is usually no longer than one year from the initial release of the product 
if actual revenues or revised forecasted revenues fall below the initial forecasted revenue for a particular license  the charge to cost of sales may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter 
the recoverability of capitalized software development costs and license fees is evaluated quarterly based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate 
when  in management s estimate  future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized costs  we expense these capitalized costs to cost of sales loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees future releases  in the period such a determination is made 
these expenses may be incurred prior to a game s release 
if a game is cancelled and never released to market  the amount is expensed to operating costs and expenses loss on impairment of capitalized software development costs and license fees cancelled games 
as of october   the net carrying value of our licenses and software development costs was million 
if we were required to write off licenses or software development costs  due to changes in market conditions or product acceptance  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
license fees and milestone payments made to our third party developers are typically considered non refundable advances against the total compensation they can earn based upon the sales performance of the products 
any additional royalty or other compensation earned beyond the milestone payments is expensed to cost of sales as incurred 
we have expensed as research and development all costs associated with the development of social games 
these games have not earned significant revenues to date and we are continuing to evaluate alternatives for future development and monetization 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we estimate the net realizable value of slow moving inventory on a title by title basis and charge the excess of cost over net realizable value to cost of sales 
some of our inventory items are packaged with accessories  such as basketballs for our nba baller beats game  belts for our zumba games and dolls for our babysitting mama game 
the purchase of these accessories involves longer lead times and minimum purchase amounts  which require us to maintain higher levels of inventory than for other games 
therefore  these items have a higher risk of obsolescence  which we review periodically based on inventory and sales levels 
accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including  in the case of stock option awards  estimating expected stock volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
commitments and contingencies 
we record a liability for commitments and contingencies when the amount is both probable and reasonably estimable 
we record associated legal fees as incurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues year ended october  net revenues cost of sales product costs software development costs and license fees loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees future releases gross profit operating expenses product research and development selling and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees canceled games operating income loss interest and financing costs and other non operating expenses income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss the following table sets forth the components of settlements and loss on impairments for the years ended october   and year ended october  in thousands loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games   the following table sets forth the source of net revenues  by game platform  for the years ended october   and year ended october  net revenues of total net revenues net revenues of total net revenues net revenues of total net revenues nintendo wii microsoft xbox nintendo ds nintendo ds sony playstation accessories and other total year ended october  versus year ended october  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended october  increased to million from million in the comparable period last year 
the increase was primarily due to increased sales of our zumba fitness products  partially offset by decreased sales of our catalog games for the nintendo ds and wii 
the results include revenue from the release of two zumba fitness sequel products for the nintendo wii and microsoft xbox  as well as catalog sales of our original zumba fitness product 
comparably  only includes sales of our original zumba fitness products 
sales in the european market increased to million from million in the same period a year ago 
during the year ended october   we recorded product sales revenues from the release of zumba products in europe under a distribution agreement with a third party 
under this agreement  we retain all rights to manufacture finished products for the european markets and a third party purchases the goods for resale 
additionally  we continued to receive licensing royalties on european distribution of our original zumba fitness products released during the twelve months ended october   under a licensing and manufacturing agreement with a third party 
under this agreement  the third party had rights to manufacture and sell the product in certain territories  and we received a royalty based on their sales 
revenue from zumba fitness products accounted for approximately and of total revenue in and  respectively  on a consolidated basis 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was million compared to a gross profit of million in the same period last year 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased  offsetting the increase in net revenues discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended october   compared to for the year ended october  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the impact of higher license costs and promotional allowances to retailers on our zumba products and lower gross margins on our other products  including the effects of amortizing software development costs of new releases 
gross profit in the current year was also affected by million of valuation charges for excess inventory  primarily related to baller beats and accessory balls 
the prior year included corresponding inventory charges for babysitting mama which was packaged with a doll 
product research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended october   from million in the increase was primarily due to costs related to our online and mobile games business and increased production headcount 
development costs associated with online and mobile games amounted to million in versus million in  as the full year effects of internal costs resulting from the june acquisition of quick hit were partially offset by lower spending for third party development 
in january of  we decided to close the facility acquired from quick hit and plan to have these games developed by outside developers 
selling and marketing expenses 
total selling and marketing expenses were approximately million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended october  the increase was primarily due to increased media advertising  primarily related to zumba fitness and certain new releases  and to sales commissions and other variable costs associated with increased sales volumes 
the year ended october  included the effects of million of reimbursements from vendors under cooperative advertising arrangements 
we had no such cooperative advertising arrangements in the year ended october  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended october   general and administrative expenses were million  compared to million for the year ended october   as lower incentive compensation costs were offset by increases in other expenses 
loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games 
for the year ended october   loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games  amounted to million compared to million in the prior year period 
our games in development are subject to periodic reviews to assess game design and changing market conditions 
when we do not expect the projected future net cash flows generated from sales to be sufficient to cover the remaining incremental cash obligation to complete a game  we cancel the game  and record a charge to operating expenses for the carrying amount of the game 
we may cancel games at any stage of development and impairment losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs  which includes financing costs associated with our factoring activities were approximately million for the year ended october  compared to million for the year ended october   reflecting reduced borrowing activity during the year 
operating income 
operating income for the year ended october  was approximately million  compared to million in the comparable period in  reflecting generally lower gross profit percentages and increased marketing expenses for new releases  including our zumba products 
change in fair value of warrant liability 
we recorded a gain of million for the year ended october   which reflected a decrease in the fair value of the warrants primarily based upon the decreased market price of a share of our common stock during the period  compared to a loss of million recognized in the year ended october   which resulted primarily from an increasing share price during the period 
income taxes 
our income tax expense was less than million in the year ended october  and million in the year ended october   which represented our current alternative minimum tax provision and certain state income taxes and reflected the use of available nol carryforwards to offset taxable income 
year ended october  versus year ended october  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended october  increased to million from million in the comparable period last year 
during the year ended october   we released zumba fitness on three platforms  the nintendo wii  kinect for xbox  and sony s move for the playstation  two cooking mama titles babysitting mama for the nintendo wii and camping mama for the nintendo ds  and others  including hulk hogan s main event and motion explosion for the xbox the strong performance of the zumba titles was primarily responsible for the increased revenues over the prior year period 
sales of zumba fitness accounted for approximately of total revenue in the period 
sales from our series of products based on cooking mama accounted for approximately of revenue in the year ended october gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was million compared to a gross profit of million in the same period last year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased net revenues for the year ended october   and higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended october   compared to for the year ended october  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to sales of zumba fitness in the united states and europe 
the microsoft xbox and nintendo wii versions of the product continued to sell at their original retail price throughout the year  resulting in comparatively higher gross margins 
these factors were partially offset by million of inventory charges for slow moving inventory  million of losses on impairment  compared to million of losses in the year ended october   and accelerated amortization of capitalized software development costs and license fees 
the charges for slow moving inventory related primarily to our babysitting mama product which was packaged with a doll which required longer lead times and order quantities to manufacture than our other products 
the impairment of capitalized software development costs and license fees related to three of our titles released in november for which sales and profitability was below our original forecasts 
we released fourteen game titles during october and november in anticipation of the holiday selling season 
the release of new titles  particularly on platforms early in their lifecycle carry a higher risk than the release of sequels 
however  they also carry a potentially higher return if they are successful and are an important part of our business strategy 
if projected sales of an individual product indicate that our investment will not be fully recovered through future cash flows  we record an impairment in the period such a determination can be made 
product research and development expenses 
research and development costs increased million to million for the year ended october   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to costs related to our online games business  increased production headcount  and charges incurred for development of console game prototypes prior to reaching technological feasibility 
we incurred approximately million in the current year for salaries  third party development and other costs related to the development of online games 
in june  we acquired assets from quick hit  inc  a developer and operator of online games  and added their former development team to enhance our abilities in the development and operation of our social games 
in addition  during  we opened a second production facility in san francisco and increased the number of producers we have managing game development due to an increase in the number and quality of games developed 
selling and marketing expenses 
total selling and marketing expenses were approximately million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended october  the increase was primarily due to increased media advertising and other marketing costs associated with the launch of zumba fitness  babysitting mama  and hulk hogan s main event including several television and internet advertising campaigns 
variable costs including commissions  warehousing and freight also increased due to higher volume and  were partially offset by lower costs incurred in europe following our shift from a publishing and distribution model to a licensing approach  including the effects of severance charges recorded in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended october   general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of million from million in the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in profit based bonus compensation recognized in the current period 
certain professional and consulting fees  as well as stock based compensation also increased 
loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games 
for the year ended october   loss on impairment of software development costs and license fees cancelled games  amounted to million compared to million in the prior year period  reflecting a greater number of projects cancelled 
our games in development are subject to periodic reviews to assess game design and changing market conditions 
when we do not expect the projected future net cash flows generated from sales to be sufficient to cover the remaining incremental cash obligation to complete a game  we cancel the game  and record a charge to operating expenses for the carrying amount of the game 
charges for the year ended october  included several games in development for the sony move platform  which totaled million  and other game projects totaling million 
operating income 
operating income for the year ended october  was approximately million  an increase of million from a million loss in the comparable period in as discussed above  increased revenues and gross profits during the year ended october  more than offset increased sales  marketing and other operating expenses and impairments during the period 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs were approximately million for the year ended october  compared to million for the year ended october  and include financing costs associated with our factoring activities  which increased based on transaction volumes 
change in fair value of warrant liability 
we have outstanding warrants that contain a provision that may require settlement by transferring assets and are  therefore  recorded at fair value as liabilities 
we recorded a loss of million for the year ended october   which reflected an increase in the fair value of the warrants during the period primarily as a result of the increased market price for a share of our common stock  compared to a gain of million for the year ended october   which reflected a decrease in the fair value of warrants during the period 
income taxes 
for the year ended october   we received proceeds of approximately million from the sale of approximately million of new jersey state income tax net operating loss carryforwards under the state s technology business tax certificate program and recorded the proceeds as an income tax benefit in the period 
in the year ended october   our income tax expense represents our current alternative minimum tax provision and certain state income taxes and reflects the use of available net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
we did not sell new jersey loss carryforwards in the year ended october  net income 
net income for the year ended october  was million compared to a loss of million for the year ended october  as discussed above  increased revenues and gross profits more than offset increased operating expenses  impairments and the change in the fair market value of our warrant liability 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million and funds available to us under our factoring and purchase order financing agreements were million and million  respectively 
we expect continued fluctuations in the use and availability of cash due to the seasonality of our business  timing of receivables collections and working capital needs necessary to finance our business 
our current plan is to fund our operations through product sales 
however  our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and we have previously incurred operating losses 
industry wide sales of video game software have declined for the past two years due to the late lifecycle of existing generation gaming platforms and the introduction of competing platforms such as mobile gaming 
based on these factors  and an analysis of retail sales for our products during the first two months of our fiscal year  we expect to experience declining sales and an operating loss for fiscal  which has been factored into our current plan 
we may be required to modify our plan  or seek outside sources of financing  and or equity sales  if our current operating plan and sales targets are not met 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event that we are unable to negotiate alternative financing  or negotiate terms that are acceptable to us  we may be forced to modify our business plan materially  including making reductions in game development and other expenditures 
additionally  we are dependent on our purchase order financing and account receivable factoring agreement to finance our working capital needs  including the purchase of inventory 
if the current level of financing was reduced or we fail to meet our operational objectives  it could create a material adverse change in the business 
factoring and purchase order financing 
to satisfy our liquidity needs  we factor our receivables 
under our factoring agreement  we have the ability to take cash advances against accounts receivable and inventory of up to million  and the availability of up to million in letters of credit 
the factor  in its sole discretion  can reduce the availability of financing at any time 
we had no outstanding advances against accounts receivable under our factoring agreement at october  we also utilize financing to provide funding for the manufacture of our products 
under an agreement with a finance company  we have up to million of availability for letters of credit and purchase order financing 
in connection with these arrangements  the finance company and the factor have a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
we had no outstanding advances for purchase order financing at october  under the terms of our factoring agreement  we sell our accounts receivable to the factor 
the factor  in its sole discretion  determines whether or not it will accept the credit risk associated with a receivable 
if the factor does not accept the credit risk on a receivable  we may sell the accounts receivable to the factor while retaining the credit risk 
in both cases we surrender all rights and control over the receivable to the factor 
however  in cases where we retain the credit risk  the amount can be charged back to us in the case of non payment by the customer 
the factor is required to remit payments to us for the accounts receivable purchased from us  provided the customer does not have a valid dispute related to the invoice 
the amount remitted to us by the factor equals the invoiced amount  adjusted for allowances and discounts we have provided to the customer  less factor charges of to of the invoiced amount 
in addition  we may request that the factor provide us with cash advances based on our accounts receivable and inventory 
the factor may either accept or reject our request for advances at its discretion 
generally  the factor allowed us to take advances in an amount equal to of net accounts receivable  plus of our inventory balance  up to a maximum of million of our inventory balance 
occasionally  the factor allows us to take advances in excess of these amounts for short term working capital needs 
these excess amounts are typically repaid within a day period 
at october   we had no excess advances outstanding 
amounts to be paid to us by the factor for any accounts receivable are offset by any amounts previously advanced by the factor 
the interest rate is prime plus  annually  subject to a floor 
in certain circumstances  an additional annually is charged for advances against inventory 
manufacturers require us to present a letter of credit  or pay cash in advance  in order to manufacture the products required under a purchase order 
we utilize letters of credit either from a finance company or our factor 
the finance company charges of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days  plus administrative fees 
our factor provides purchase order financing at a cost of of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days 
additional charges are incurred if letters of credit remain outstanding in excess of the original time period and or the financing company is not paid at the time the products are received 
when our liquidity position allows  we will pay cash in advance instead of utilizing purchase order financing 
this results in reduced financing and administrative fees associated with purchase order financing 
advances from customers 
on a case by case basis  distributors and other customers have agreed to provide us with cash advances on their orders 
these advances are then applied against future sales to these customers 
in exchange for these advances  we offer these customers beneficial pricing or other considerations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks in the normal course of business  primarily risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we earn certain revenues from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly euros  which may result in gains or losses in our results of operations 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely affected by declines in exchange rates for the euro 
in the year ended october   we launched zumba fitness and zumba rush in europe and recognized sales revenue to our distributor 
accordingly  our revenue and gross profits from transactions denominated in euros increased significantly in the period 
however  the portion of our total revenue represented by these transactions may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we may hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated revenues by entering into foreign exchange contracts that reduce  but do not eliminate our risk 
during the years ended october  and  we did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts  including any related to cash flow hedging activities 
we do not maintain significant working capital balances denominated in foreign currencies or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at october   approximately million of accounts receivable were denominated in euros and due to the company within days 
accordingly  each hypothetical decrease in the exchange rate of dollars per euro during the period the receivables were outstanding would have directly reduced the value of the receivables by approximately  the amount of outstanding accounts receivable denominated in euros varies significantly during the year  primarily related to new game releases 
euro denominated accounts receivable are typically due to the company on day terms 
in addition  at october   approximately million of royalties receivable from licensees were denominated in dollars and related to licensee sales in europe 
royalty receivables also vary significantly during the year in relation to licensee sales and are generally due to the company on a quarterly basis within days of the company s fiscal quarter end 
during the fiscal year ended october   royalty revenues amounted to approximately million 
accordingly  each hypothetical monthly decrease in the exchange rate of dollars per unit of local currency euro during the period accrued royalty receivables were outstanding may have reduced the value of such receivables by an average of approximately  interest rate risk to satisfy our liquidity needs  we factor our receivables and periodically utilize financing to provide funding for the manufacture of our products 
we had no outstanding advances for purchase order financing at october  under the terms of our factoring agreement  we sell our accounts receivable to the factor 
the amount remitted to us by the factor equals the invoiced amount  adjusted for allowances and discounts we have provided to the customer  less factor charges of to of the invoiced amount and the interest rate on advances is generally prime plus  annually  subject to a floor 
when we utilize letters of credit from our finance company  the finance company charges of the purchase order amount for each transaction for days  plus administrative fees 
additional charges are incurred if letters of credit remain outstanding in excess of the original time period and or the financing company is not paid at the time the products are received 
at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million in the form of bank deposits and money market funds 
our cash balances fluctuate significantly during the year 
however  interest income on cash balances is not expected to be significant to our results of operations
