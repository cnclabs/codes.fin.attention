as part of the merger  the bank will merge with and into manufacturers and traders trust company 
subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement  in the merger  hudson city shareholders will have the right to receive with respect to each of their shares of common stock of the company  at their election but subject to proration and adjustment procedures  of a share of common stock  or cash having a value equal to the product of multiplied by the average closing price of the m t common stock for the ten days immediately prior to the completion of the merger 
the merger agreement also provides that at the closing of the merger  of the outstanding shares of hudson city common stock will be converted into the right to receive cash and the remainder of the outstanding shares of hudson city common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of m t common stock 
in connection with the merger  m t has filed a registration statement on form s with the sec that includes a joint proxy statement of the company and m t and a prospectus of m t  as well as other relevant documents concerning the merger 
on february   m t filed amendment no 
to the s the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on february  a definitive proxy statement has been mailed to the company s shareholders 
the merger is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary conditions 
the company anticipates that the closing of the merger will take place in the second quarter of financial condition and results of operations during  we continued to focus on our consumer oriented business model through the origination of one to four family mortgage loans 
we have traditionally funded this loan production with customer deposits and borrowings 
market interest rates remained at historically low levels during and  as a result  we continued to reduce the size of our balance sheet 
our assets decreased by to billion at december  from billion at december   primarily due to elevated repayments of mortgage related assets in this low interest rate environment 
during the first quarter of  the bank completed the restructuring transaction which involved the extinguishment of billion of structured putable borrowings with an average cost of 
the extinguishment of the borrowings was funded by the sale of billion of securities with an average yield of and billion of new short term fixed maturity borrowings with an average cost of 
interest rates continued to decline during which resulted in increased prepayments on our mortgage related assets and calls of our investment securities 
during the fourth quarter of  the bank used the excess liquidity provided by the prepayments of mortgage related assets and calls of investment securities to extinguish billion of structured putable borrowings with a weighted average cost of 
the restructuring transaction and the extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter of are collectively referred to as the transactions 
the transactions reduced after tax earnings by billion 
the transactions were part of our ongoing strategy to reduce interest rate risk and realign our funding mix 
we decided to complete the transactions because of the effect of the market events during  including the unprecedented involvement of the us government and the gses in the mortgage market and the protracted period of historically low market interest rates had on our balance sheet 
the extended low interest rate 
table of contents environment caused accelerated prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets and calls of our investment securities resulting in the reinvestment of these funds at the current low market interest rates 
these lower yielding assets and higher cost borrowings  which did not reprice during this extended low rate environment  caused margin compression and heightened interest rate risk concerns for us 
our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which  in part  is a direct result of the market interest rate environment 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  primarily mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the shape of the market yield curve  the timing of the placement and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet  the prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets and the puts of our borrowings 
our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates  credit quality  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
our results are also affected by the market price of our stock  as the expense of our employee stock ownership plan is related to the current price of our common stock 
the fomc noted that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months  apart from weather related disruptions  although the unemployment rate remains elevated 
the fomc noted that while the housing sector and household spending continue to show signs of improvement  growth in business fixed investment has slowed 
the national unemployment rate was in december  a decline from an unemployment rate in december the fomc decided to maintain the overnight lending rate at zero to during the fourth quarter of and stated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 
previously  the fomc stated that these levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid as a result  market interest rates have remained at low levels  and consequently  the yields on our mortgage related assets continued to decrease during the fomc decided to expand its accommodative monetary policy by purchasing an additional billion of agency mortgage backed securities per month to ensure that inflation is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate regarding both inflation and unemployment 
in addition  during the federal reserve will purchase longer term treasury securities initially at a pace of billion per month 
this follows the completion of operation twist at the end of these programs will continue to put downward pressure on longer term interest rates 
during  our net interest rate spread increased basis points to and our net interest margin increased basis points to as compared to and  respectively for the increase in our interest rate spread and net interest margin during is primarily due to the effects of the transactions 
notwithstanding the increases in our interest rate spread and net interest margin  net interest income decreased million  or  to million for as compared to million for the decrease in net interest income reflects the overall decrease in the size of our balance sheet as a result of the transactions and the lack of reinvestment opportunities in mortgage related assets represented of our average interest earning assets during market interest rates on mortgage related assets remained at near historic lows primarily due to the frb s program to purchase mortgage backed securities to keep mortgage rates low and provide stimulus to the housing markets 
in addition  over the past few years  we have faced increased competition for mortgage loans due to the unprecedented involvement of the gses in the mortgage market as a result of the economic crisis 
the gses involvement is also an attempt to provide stimulus to the housing markets and has caused the interest rates for the thirty year fixed rate mortgage loans that conform to the gses guidelines for purchase to remain low 
we originate such conforming loans and retain them in our portfolio 
further  the fomc has decided to maintain the overnight lending rate at the current level of zero to through mid if recent economic conditions 
table of contents continue 
the resulting low market interest rates have made reinvestment opportunities scarce 
we expect this adverse environment for portfolio lending to continue  with the likely result that we will continue to reduce the size of our balance sheet and experience compression of our net interest margin 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for as compared to million for the decrease in the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was due primarily to the overall declining trends in net charge offs  the stabilization of home prices and a decrease in the size of the loan portfolio  yet resulted in an overall increase in our allowance for loan losses as non performing loans continued to increase and unemployment levels remain elevated 
non performing loans  defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent days or more  amounted to billion at december  compared with billion at december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at december  compared with at december  the highly publicized foreclosure issues that have recently affected the nation s largest mortgage loan servicers have resulted in greater bank regulatory  court and state attorney general scrutiny 
as a result  our foreclosure process and the time to complete a foreclosure continue to be prolonged  especially in new jersey and new york where of our non performing loans are located 
we continue to experience a time frame to repayment or foreclosure ranging from to months from the initial non performing period 
this protracted foreclosure process delays our ability to resolve non performing loans through the sale of the underlying collateral 
total non interest income was million for as compared to million for included in non interest income for the year were net gains on securities transactions of million which resulted from the sale of billion of securities available for sale 
substantially all of the proceeds from the sale of securities were used to repay borrowings as part of the restructuring transaction 
there were no security sales for the year ended december  total non interest expense amounted to billion for as compared to billion for included in total non interest expense for was a billion loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the transactions 
loans decreased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  our loan production was billion for offset by billion in principal repayments 
loan production declined during which reflects our low appetite for adding long term fixed rate mortgage loans in the current low market interest rate environment 
the decrease in net loans was also due to continued elevated levels of refinancing activity caused by low market interest rates 
mortgage backed securities decreased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in mortgage backed securities reflected repayments of billion  partially offset by purchases of billion of mortgage backed securities issued by gses 
investment securities decreased million to million at december  due to calls of million during the proceeds from the calls were used to purchase million of corporate bonds 
total deposits decreased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  due to planned reductions in deposit rates to curtail deposit growth during this time of limited investment opportunities 
borrowings amounted to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the decrease in borrowed funds is a result of the maturity of short term borrowings during and the continuation of our strategy of allowing the balance sheet to deleverage as the borrowings mature 
the bank is currently subject to the bank mou 
in accordance with the bank mou  the bank has adopted and has implemented enhanced operating policies and procedures that are intended to continue to a reduce our 
table of contents level of interest rate risk  b reduce our funding concentration  c diversify our funding sources  d enhance our liquidity position  e monitor and manage loan modifications and f maintain our capital position in accordance with our existing capital plan 
in addition  we developed a written strategic plan for the bank which establishes various objectives  including  but not limited to  objectives for the bank s overall risk profile  earnings performance  growth and balance sheet mix and to enhance our enterprise risk management program 
the implementation of the strategic plan has been suspended pending the completion of the merger 
the company is currently subject to the company mou 
in accordance with the company mou  the company must  among other things support the bank s compliance with the bank mou 
the company mou also requires the company to a obtain approval from the frb prior to receiving a capital distribution from the bank or declaring a dividend to shareholders  b obtain approval from the frb prior to repurchasing or redeeming any company stock or incurring any debt with a maturity of greater than one year and c submit a comprehensive capital plan and a comprehensive earnings plan to the frb 
these agreements will remain in effect until modified or terminated by the occ with respect to the bank mou and the frb with respect to the company mou 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets decreased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in total assets reflected a billion decrease in total mortgage backed securities  a billion decrease in net loans and a million decrease in federal home loan bank fhlb stock 
our net loans decreased billion to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the decrease in loans primarily reflects reduced levels of purchases as well as elevated levels of loan repayments during as a result of continued low market interest rates 
historically our focus has been on loan portfolio growth through the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans in new jersey  new york  pennsylvania and connecticut and  to a lesser extent  the purchases of mortgage loans 
during  we originated billion and purchased million of loans  compared to originations of billion and purchases of million for the originations and purchases of loans were offset by principal repayments of billion in  as compared to billion for the decrease in loan originations and purchases during reflects our low appetite for adding long term fixed rate mortgage loans in the current low market interest rate environment 
the decrease in net loans was also due to continued elevated levels of refinancing activity caused by low market interest rates 
our first mortgage loan production during was substantially all in one to four family mortgage loans 
approximately of mortgage loan originations for were variable rate loans as compared to approximately for approximately of mortgage loans purchased for the year ended december  were fixed rate mortgage loans 
fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for of our first mortgage loan portfolio at december  and at december  our all amounted to million at december  and million at december  non performing loans amounted to billion or of total loans at december  as compared to billion or of total loans at december  total mortgage backed securities decreased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in mortgage backed securities reflected repayments of billion  partially offset by purchases of billion of mortgage backed securities issued by gses 
at december   variable rate mortgage backed securities accounted for of our portfolio compared with at december  
table of contents total investment securities decreased million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the calls of million of investment securities during  partially offset by the purchase of corporate bonds in the amount of million during the year ended december  fhlb stock decreased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in the balance of fhlb stock was primarily due to mandatory redemptions of stock due to a decrease in the amount of borrowings outstanding with the fhlb 
total cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase is primarily due to increased repayments on mortgage related assets and the lack of reinvestment opportunities due to low market interest rates 
other assets decreased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in other assets is primarily due to a decrease of million in current and deferred tax assets 
the decrease in current and deferred tax assets is primarily due to accrued tax expense related to earnings during total liabilities decreased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in total liabilities primarily reflected a billion decrease in borrowed funds and a decrease in total deposits of billion 
total deposits decreased billion  or  to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the decrease in total deposits reflected a billion decrease in our money market accounts and a million decrease in time deposits  partially offset by an increase interest bearing transaction and savings accounts of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in our money market and time deposit accounts is primarily due to planned reductions in our deposit rates to curtail deposit growth while we experience excess liquidity from prepayment activity and limited investment opportunities 
we had branches at both december  and borrowings amounted to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the decrease in borrowed funds was primarily a result of the maturing of the short term borrowings utilized as part of the restructuring transaction 
at december   we had billion of borrowed funds with put dates within one year  including billion that can be put back to the company during any three month period 
if interest rates were to decrease  or remain consistent with current rates  we believe these borrowings would probably not be put back and our average cost of existing borrowings would not decrease even as market interest rates decrease 
conversely  if interest rates increase above the market interest rate for similar borrowings  we believe these borrowings would likely be put back at their next put date and our cost to replace these borrowings would increase 
however  we believe  given current market conditions  that the likelihood that a significant portion of these borrowings would be put back will not increase substantially unless interest rates were to increase by at least basis points 
other liabilities increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase is due to a million increase in accrued expenses 
the increase in accrued expenses is primarily the result of an increase in accrued fdic premiums of million and a million increase in the postretirement benefit plan liability 
total shareholders equity increased million to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was primarily due to net income of million for the year ended 
table of contents december  and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
this increase was partially offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders of million 
accumulated other comprehensive income amounted to million at december  and included a million after tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale million pre tax partially offset by a million after tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the funded status of our employee benefit plans 
accumulated other comprehensive income amounted to million at december  and included an million after tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale million pre tax partially offset by a million after tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the funded status of our employee benefit plans 
as of december   there remained  shares that may be purchased under our existing stock repurchase programs 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during pursuant to our repurchase programs 
pursuant to the company mou  any future share repurchases must be approved by the frb 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  we may not repurchase shares of hudson city bancorp common stock without the consent of m t 
during   shares were surrendered by employees for withholding taxes related to vesting stock awards 
at december   our capital ratios were in excess of the applicable regulatory requirements to be considered well capitalized 
see liquidity and capital resources 
at december   our shareholders equity to asset ratio was compared with at december  the ratio of average shareholders equity to average assets was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  our book value per share  using the period end number of outstanding shares  less purchased but unallocated employee stock ownership plan shares and less purchased but unvested recognition and retention plan shares  was at december  and at december  our tangible book value per share  calculated by deducting goodwill and the core deposit intangible from shareholders equity  was as of december  and at december  analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities  such as time deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them 

table of contents average balance sheet 
the following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for  and the table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
we derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
we derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated 
interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields 
yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances and therefore have a zero yield

table of contents rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which the changes in interest rates and the changes in volume of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated

interest and dividend income 
total interest and dividend income for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to billion from billion for the year ended december  the decrease in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of total interest earning assets of billion  or  to billion for from billion for the decrease in total interest and dividend income was also due to a decrease of basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to for from for the decrease in the 
table of contents average balance of total interest earning assets was due primarily to the effects of the transactions and elevated levels of repayments of mortgage related assets during due to the low interest rate environment 
for the year ended december   interest on first mortgage loans decreased million  or  to billion from billion for the year ended december  this was primarily due to a billion decrease in the average balance of first mortgage loans to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income on mortgage loans was also due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the average yield earned during the year ended december  was due to lower market interest rates on mortgage products and also due to the continued mortgage refinancing activity 
refinancing activity  which resulted in continued elevated levels of loan repayments  also caused the average balance of our first mortgage loans to decline during the year ended december  interest on consumer and other loans decreased million to million for from million for the average balance of consumer and other loans decreased million to million for as compared to million for and the average yield earned decreased basis points to as compared to for the same respective periods 
the average balance of consumer loans decreased as consumer loans is not a business that we actively pursue 
the decrease in the weighted average yield is a result of current market interest rates 
interest on mortgage backed securities decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to a billion decrease in the average balance of mortgage backed securities to billion for from billion for the decrease in interest income on mortgage backed securities was also due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield to for from for the decrease in the average balance of mortgage backed securities was due primarily to the effects of the restructuring transaction

the decrease in the average balance of fhlb stock was due primarily to mandatory redemptions of stock due to a decrease in the amount of borrowings outstanding with the fhlb 
interest on federal funds sold and other overnight deposits amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the average balance of federal funds sold and other overnight deposits amounted to million for as compared to billion for the yield earned on federal funds sold and other overnight deposits was for the year 
table of contents ended december  and for the year ended december  the decrease in the average balance of federal funds sold and other overnight deposits is primarily a result of the timing of the transactions 
interest expense 
total interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from billion for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a billion  or  decrease in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to billion for from billion for the decrease was also due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities was due primarily to an billion decrease in the average balance of borrowings and a billion decrease in the average balance of total deposits 
interest expense on our time deposit accounts decreased million to million for from million for the decrease in interest on time deposits was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average cost to for compared with for as maturing time deposits were renewed or replaced by new time deposits at lower rates 
this decrease was also due to a million decrease in the average balance of time deposit accounts to billion for from billion for the decline in the average balance of our time deposits also reflects our decision to lower deposit rates to continue our balance sheet reduction while profitable investment opportunities remain scarce in the current environment

at december   time deposits scheduled to mature within one year totaled billion with an average cost of 
these time deposits are scheduled to mature as follows billion with an average cost of in the first quarter of  billion with an average cost of in the second quarter of  billion with an average cost of in the third quarter of and billion with an average cost of in the fourth quarter of based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy  we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or as transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing rate 
for the year ended december   interest expense on borrowed funds decreased million to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to an billion decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds to billion for from billion for this decrease was partially offset by a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds to for as compared to for the decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds is primarily due to the transactions 
the increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds was due to the maturity of lower cost short term borrowings that were used to fund a portion of the debt extinguishments in the restructuring transaction 
borrowings amounted to billion at december  with an average cost of 
there are no scheduled maturities for 
table of contents at december   we had billion of borrowings with put dates within one year 
we believe  given current market conditions  that the likelihood that a significant portion of these borrowings would be put back will not increase substantially unless interest rates were to increase by at least basis points

net interest income 
net interest income decreased million  or  to million for compared to million for our interest rate spread increased basis points to for as compared to for our net interest margin increased basis points to for as compared to for the increase in our interest rate spread and net interest margin during is primarily due to transactions 
notwithstanding the increase in interest rate spread and net interest margin  net interest income decreased reflecting the overall decrease in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for as compared to million for the all amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was due primarily to the overall declining trends in net charge offs  the stabilization of home prices and a decrease in the size of the loan portfolio 
however  our allowance for loan losses increased as non performing loans continued to increase and unemployment levels remain elevated 
we have also taken into consideration the loss exposure on our loan portfolio as a result of hurricane sandy 
we estimate that our loss exposure to these loans is less than million 
we recorded our provision for loan losses during based on our all methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including the amount of non performing loans  the loss experience of our non performing loans  recent collateral valuations  conditions in the real estate and housing markets  current economic conditions  particularly continued elevated levels of unemployment  and growth or shrinkage in the loan portfolio 
see critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and  to a lesser extent  second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties 
our loan growth is primarily concentrated in one to four family mortgage loans with original loan to value ltv ratios of less than 
the average ltv ratio of our first mortgage loan originations and our total first mortgage loan portfolio were and  respectively using the appraised value at the time of origination 
the value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions 
as part of our estimation of the all  we monitor changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations 
based on our analysis of the data for  we concluded that home values in our lending markets declined from levels  but stabilized during the latter half of economic conditions have improved but at a slower pace than anticipated during home sale activity and real estate valuations improved slightly during the second half of and unemployment  while improving  remained at elevated levels 
we continue to closely monitor the local and national real estate markets and other factors related to risks inherent in our loan portfolio 
non performing loans amounted to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  non performing loans at december  included billion of one to four family first mortgage loans as compared to billion at december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at december  compared to at december  loans delinquent to days amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  loans delinquent to days amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  foreclosed real estate amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  accordingly  total early stage delinquencies loans to days past due increased million to million at december  from million at december  as a result of our underwriting policies  our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity  at the time of origination  in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans 
due to the steady deterioration of real estate values in recent years  the ltv ratios based on appraisals obtained at time 
table of contents of origination do not necessarily indicate the extent to which we may incur a loss on any given loan that may go into foreclosure 
however  our lower average ltv ratios at origination have helped to moderate our charge offs 
at december   the ratio of the all to non performing loans was as compared to at december  the ratio of the all to total loans was at december  as compared to at december  changes in the ratio of the all to non performing loans is not  absent other factors  an indication of the adequacy of the all since there is not necessarily a direct relationship between changes in various asset quality ratios and changes in the all  non performing loans and losses we may incur on our loan portfolio 
in the current economic environment  a loan generally becomes non performing when the borrower experiences financial difficulty 
in many cases  the borrower also has a second mortgage or home equity loan on the property 
in substantially all of these cases  we do not hold the second mortgage or home equity loan as this is not a business we have actively pursued 
we obtain new collateral values by the time a loan becomes days past due 
if the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we charge off an amount to reduce the loan to the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs 
as a result  certain losses inherent in our non performing loans are being recognized as charge offs which may result in a lower ratio of the all to non performing loans 
charge offs amounted to million for as compared to million for recoveries of amounts previously charged off amounted to million for as compared to million for write downs and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate amounted to million for as compared to million for the results of our reappraisal process and our recent charge off history are considered in the determination of the all 
as part of our estimation of the all  we monitor changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations including the fhfa and case shiller 
our asset quality committee aqc uses these indices and a stratification of our loan portfolio by state as part of its quarterly determination of the all 
we do not apply different loss factors based on geographic locations since  at december   of our loan portfolio and of our non performing loans were located in the new york metropolitan area 
we generally obtain updated collateral values by the time a loan becomes days past due and annually thereafter  which we believe identifies potential charge offs more accurately than a house price index that is based on a wide geographic area and includes many different types of houses 
however  we use house price indices to identify geographic trends in housing markets to determine if an overall adjustment to the all is required based on loans we have in those geographic areas and to determine if changes in the loss factors used in the all quantitative analysis are necessary 
our quantitative analysis of the all accounts for increases in non performing loans by applying progressively higher risk factors to loans as they become more delinquent 
due to the nature of our loan portfolio  our evaluation of the adequacy of our all is performed primarily on a pooled basis 
each quarter we prepare an analysis which categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type fixed and variable one to four family  interest only  reduced documentation  multi family  commercial  construction  etc  loan source originated or purchased and payment status ie  current or number of days delinquent 
loans with known potential losses are categorized separately 
we assign estimated loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type 
these factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to our loss experience  delinquency trends  portfolio growth and environmental factors such as the status of the regional economy and housing market  in order to ascertain that the loss factors cover probable and estimable losses inherent in the portfolio 
we define our loss experience on non performing loans as the ratio of the excess of the loan balance including selling costs over the updated collateral value to the principal balance of loans for which we have updated valuations 
we generally obtain updated collateral values by the time a loan becomes days past due and on an annual basis thereafter for as long as the loan remains non performing 
based on our analysis  our estimated loss experience on our non performing one to four family first mortgage loans was approximately during as compared to in and in 
table of contents in addition to our loss experience  we also use environmental factors and qualitative analyses to determine the adequacy of our all 
this analysis includes further evaluation of economic factors  such as trends in the unemployment rate  as well as a ratio analysis to evaluate the overall measurement of the all  a review of delinquency ratios  net charge off ratios and the ratio of the all to both non performing loans and total loans 
the qualitative review is used to reassess the overall determination of the all and to ensure that directional changes in the all and the provision for loan losses are supported by relevant internal and external data 
based on our recent loss experience on non performing loans  and to a lesser extent  hurricane sandy  and our consideration of environmental factors  we increased certain loss factors used in our quantitative analysis of the all for our one to four family first mortgage loans during the adjustment to our loss factors in did not have a material effect on the ultimate level of our all or on our provision for loan losses 
if our future loss experience requires additional increases in our loss factors  this may result in increased levels of loan loss provisions 
we consider the average ltv ratio of our non performing loans and our total portfolio in relation to the overall changes in house prices in our lending markets when determining the all 
this provides us with a macro indication of the severity of potential losses that might be expected 
since substantially all our portfolio consists of first mortgage loans on residential properties  the ltv ratio is particularly important to us when a loan becomes non performing 
the weighted average ltv ratio in our one to four family mortgage loan portfolio at december  was approximately  using appraised values at the time of origination 
the average ltv ratio of our non performing loans was approximately at december  based on the valuation indices  house prices have declined in the new york metropolitan area  where of our non performing loans were located at december   by approximately from the peak of the market in through october and by nationwide during that period 
for the twelve months ended september   home prices declined in the new york metropolitan area and increased nationwide 
changes in house values may affect our loss experience which may require that we change the loss factors used in our quantitative analysis of the all 
there can be no assurance whether significant further declines in house values may occur and result in higher loss experience and increased levels of charge offs and loan loss provisions 
net charge offs amounted to million for as compared to net charge offs of million for net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was for as compared to for our charge offs on non performing loans have historically been low due to the amount of underlying equity in the properties collateralizing our first mortgage loans 
until the recent recessionary cycle  it was our experience that as a non performing loan approached foreclosure  the borrower sold the underlying property or  if there was a second mortgage or other subordinated lien  the subordinated lien holder would purchase the property to protect their interest thereby resulting in the full payment of principal and interest to hudson city savings 
due to the unprecedented level of foreclosures and the desire by most states to slow the foreclosure process  we continue to experience a time frame to repayment or foreclosure ranging from to months from the initial non performing period 
these delays have impacted our level of non performing loans as these loans take longer to migrate to real estate owned and ultimate disposition 
in addition  the highly publicized foreclosure issues that have recently affected the nation s largest mortgage loan servicers has resulted in greater court and state attorney general scrutiny  and the time to complete a foreclosure continues to be prolonged  especially in new york and new jersey where of our non performing loans are located 
if real estate prices do not improve or decline  this extended time may result in further charge offs 
in addition  current conditions in the housing market have made it more difficult for borrowers to sell homes to satisfy the mortgage and second lien holders and are less likely to repay our loan if the value of the property is not enough to satisfy their loan 
we continue to closely monitor the property values underlying our non performing loans during this timeframe and take appropriate charge offs when the loan balances exceed the underlying property values 
at december  and december   commercial and construction loans evaluated for impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance amounted to million and million  respectively 
based on this evaluation  we established an all of million for loans classified 
table of contents as impaired at december  compared to million at december  charge offs related to these loans amounted to  in none in 
although we believe that we have established and maintained the all at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
changes in our loss experience on non performing loans  the loss factors used in our quantitative analysis of the all and continued increases in overall loan delinquencies can have a significant impact on our need for increased levels of loan loss provisions in the future 
although we use the best information available  the level of the all remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change

compensation and employee benefit costs increased million  or  to million for as compared to million for the increase in compensation and employee benefit costs is primarily due to increases of million in compensation costs  million in health plan expense  and million in pension expense 
the increase in compensation costs is due primarily to a million increase in incentive compensation plan expense during as compared to as well as to additional full time equivalent employees and normal salary increases 
the increase in health plan expense was due primarily to additional full time equivalent employees

at december   we had  full time equivalent employees as compared to  at december  for the year ended december  federal deposit insurance increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the new deposit assessment methodology adopted by the federal deposit insurance corporation that became effective on april  and which redefined the assessment base as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity

interest and dividend income 
total interest and dividend income for decreased million  or  to billion from billion for the decrease in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of total interest earning assets of billion  or  to billion for from billion for the decrease in total interest and dividend income was also due to a decrease of basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to for from for the decrease in the average balance of total interest earning assets was due primarily to the effects of the transactions 
the decrease in the average yield earned on our interest earning assets reflects the elevated levels of repayments on mortgage related assets and the calls on investment securities  and the reinvestment of those cash flows at current market interest rates

the decrease in the weighted average yield on mortgage backed securities is a result of lower yields on securities purchased during when market interest rates were lower than the yield earned on the existing portfolio 
in addition  mortgage backed securities purchased before which have higher yields  continue to repay  thus reducing the average yield on our mortgage backed portfolio 
interest on investment securities decreased million to million during as compared to million for this decrease was due primarily to a billion decrease in the average balance to billion and a decrease of basis points in the average yield to for as compared to for the decrease in the average balance was due to the calls of billion of investment securities during the decrease in the average yield earned reflects current market interest rates

the decrease in the average balance of fhlb stock was due primarily to mandatory redemptions of stock due to a decrease in the amount of borrowings outstanding with the fhlb 
interest on federal funds sold amounted to million for as compared to million for the average balance of federal funds sold amounted to billion for as compared to billion for the same period in the yield earned on federal funds sold was for and for the increase in the average balance of federal funds sold for is primarily due to the timing of the extinguishment of borrowings in the transactions relative to the timing of the receipt of the proceeds from securities sales  calls of investment securities and payments received on mortgage related assets that were used to fund the extinguishments 
interest expense 
total interest expense for decreased million  or  to billion from billion for this decrease was primarily due to a billion  or  decrease in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to billion for from billion for the decrease in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to the reduction of total borrowings as part of the transactions 
the decrease in total interest expense was also due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to for compared with for interest expense on our time deposit accounts decreased million to million for as compared to million for this decrease was due to a billion decrease in the average balance of time deposit accounts to billion for from billion for as a portion of our maturing time deposits transferred to our money market accounts

net interest income 
net interest income decreased million  or  to million for compared to billion for during  our net interest rate spread decreased basis points to for from for our net interest margin decreased basis points to during from for the decrease in our net interest margin and net interest rate spread was primarily due to the decrease in the weighted average yield of our interest earning assets and the decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets 
the yields on mortgage related assets  which account for of the average balance of interest earning assets for the year ended december   remained at near historic lows 
the low market interest rates resulted in increased refinancing activity which caused a decrease in the yield we earned on mortgage related assets as customers refinanced to lower mortgage rates and our new loan production and asset purchases were at the current low market interest rates 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for as compared to million for the all amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was due primarily to the stabilization in early stage delinquencies  represented by loans that are to days delinquent  the decrease in net charge offs and a decrease in the size of the loan portfolio in each case relative to the year ended december  these factors were tempered by the continued decline in home prices  although at a slower rate than during the recent recessionary cycle  continued elevated levels of unemployment and an increase in the growth rate of non performing loans during the second half of as compared to the first six months of we recorded our provision for loan losses during based on our all methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including the amount of non performing loans  the loss experience of our non performing loans  recent collateral valuations  conditions in the real estate and housing markets  current economic conditions  particularly continued elevated levels of unemployment  and growth or shrinkage in the loan portfolio 
see critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and  to a lesser extent  second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties 
our loan growth is primarily concentrated in one to four family mortgage loans with original loan to value ltv ratios of less than 
the average ltv ratio of our first mortgage loan originations and our total first mortgage loan portfolio were and  respectively using the appraised value at the time of origination 
the value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions 
as part of our estimation of the all  we monitor changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations 
based on our analysis of the data for  we concluded that 
table of contents home values in our lending markets continued to decline from levels  as evidenced by reduced levels of sales  increasing inventories of houses on the market  declining house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market 
the national economy was in a recessionary cycle during and with the housing and real estate markets suffering significant losses in value 
economic conditions have improved but at a slower pace than anticipated during home sale activity and real estate valuations remained at reduced levels during and unemployment  while improving  remained at elevated levels 
we continue to closely monitor the local and national real estate markets and other factors related to risks inherent in our loan portfolio 
non performing loans amounted to billion at december  as compared to million at december  non performing loans at december  included billion of one to four family first mortgage loans as compared to million at december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at december  compared to at december  loans delinquent to days amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  loans delinquent to days amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  foreclosed real estate amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  accordingly  total early stage delinquencies loans to days past due increased million to million at december  from million at december  as a result of our underwriting policies  our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity  at the time of origination  in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans 
due to the steady deterioration of real estate values in recent years  the ltv ratios based on appraisals obtained at time of origination do not necessarily indicate the extent to which we may incur a loss on any given loan that may go into foreclosure 
however  our lower average ltv ratios at origination have helped to moderate our charge offs 
at december   the ratio of the all to non performing loans was as compared to at december  the ratio of the all to total loans was at december  as compared to at december  changes in the ratio of the all to non performing loans is not  absent other factors  an indication of the adequacy of the all since there is not necessarily a direct relationship between changes in various asset quality ratios and changes in the all  non performing loans and losses we may incur on our loan portfolio 
in the current economic environment  a loan generally becomes non performing when the borrower experiences financial difficulty 
in many cases  the borrower also has a second mortgage or home equity loan on the property 
in substantially all of these cases  we do not hold the second mortgage or home equity loan as this is not a business we have actively pursued 
we generally obtain new collateral values by the time a loan becomes days past due 
if the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we charge off an amount to reduce the loan to the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs 
as a result  certain losses inherent in our non performing loans are being recognized as charge offs which may result in a lower ratio of the all to non performing loans 
charge offs amounted to million for as compared to million for recoveries of amounts previously charged off amounted to million for as compared to million for write downs and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate amounted to million for as compared to million for the results of our reappraisal process and our recent charge off history are considered in the determination of the all 
as part of our estimation of the all  we monitor changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations including the fhfa and case shiller 
our asset quality committee aqc uses these indices and a stratification of our loan portfolio by state as part of its quarterly determination of the all 
we do not apply different loss factors based on geographic locations since  at december   of our loan portfolio and of our non performing loans were located in the new york metropolitan area 
we generally obtain updated collateral values by the time a loan becomes 
table of contents days past due and annually thereafter  which we believe identifies potential charge offs more accurately than a house price index that is based on a wide geographic area and includes many different types of houses 
however  we use house price indices to identify geographic trends in housing markets to determine if an overall adjustment to the all is required based on loans we have in those geographic areas and to determine if changes in the loss factors used in the all quantitative analysis are necessary 
our quantitative analysis of the all accounts for increases in non performing loans by applying progressively higher risk factors to loans as they become more delinquent 
due to the nature of our loan portfolio  our evaluation of the adequacy of our all is performed primarily on a pooled basis 
each quarter we prepare an analysis which categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type fixed and variable one to four family  multi family  commercial  construction  etc  loan source originated or purchased and payment status ie  current or number of days delinquent 
loans with known potential losses are categorized separately 
we assign estimated loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type 
these factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to our loss experience  delinquency trends  portfolio growth and environmental factors such as the status of the regional economy and housing market  in order to ascertain that the loss factors cover probable and estimable losses inherent in the portfolio 
based on our recent loss experience on non performing loans  we increased certain loss factors used in our quantitative analysis of the all for our one to four family first mortgage loans during we define our loss experience on non performing loans as the ratio of the excess of the loan balance including selling costs over the updated collateral value to the principal balance of loans for which we have updated valuations 
we generally obtain updated collateral values by the time a loan becomes days past due and on an annual basis thereafter for as long as the loan remains non performing

the remaining loans modified were current at the time of the restructuring and have complied with the terms of their restructure agreement 
we discontinue accruing interest on troubled debt restructurings that are past due days or more or if we believe we will not collect all amounts contractually due 
approximately million of troubled debt restructurings that were previously accruing interest became days or more past due during for which we ceased accruing interest 
at december   loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring totaled million 
these loans were current at the time of their restructuring and were in compliance with the terms of their restructure agreement at december  loans that were modified in a troubled debt restructuring primarily represent loans that have been in a deferred principal payment plan for an extended period of time  generally in excess of six months  loans that have had past due amounts capitalized as part of the loan balance  loans that have a confirmed chapter bankruptcy status and other repayment plans 
in addition  based on recent regulatory guidance  as of december  we classified million of loans that have completed chapter bankruptcy as troubled debt restructurings 
these loans are individually evaluated for impairment to determine if the carrying value of the loan is in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows

these securities account for substantially all of our securities 
we do not purchase unrated or private label mortgage backed securities or other higher risk securities such as those backed by sub prime loans 
during  we purchased million of investment grade corporate bonds 
there were no debt securities past due or securities for which the company currently believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security 
liquidity and capital resources the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations  loan and security purchases  deposit withdrawals  repayment of borrowings and operating expenses 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  the maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations 
deposit flows  calls of investment securities and borrowed funds  and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  national and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
these factors reduce the predictability of the receipt of these sources of funds 
our membership in the fhlb provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds 
we also have the ability to access the capital markets  depending on market conditions 
our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans  the purchase of mortgage backed securities  and the purchase of investment securities 
these activities are funded primarily by borrowings  deposit growth and the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
we originated billion and purchased million of loans during as compared to originations of billion and purchases of million during our loan purchase activity has significantly declined as the gses have been actively purchasing loans as part of their efforts to keep mortgage rates low to support the housing market during the recent economic recession 
as a result  the sellers from whom we have historically purchased loans are originating loans at lower rates than we would accept  selling many of their loans to the gses or retaining these loans in their own portfolios 
we expect that the amount of loan purchases will 
table of contents continue to be at reduced levels for the near term 
principal repayments on loans amounted to billion for as compared to billion for elevated levels of refinancing activity caused by low market interest rates have caused increased levels of repayments to continue during at december   commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans amounted to million and  respectively  as compared to million and  respectively  at december  purchases of mortgage backed securities during were billion as compared to billion during principal repayments on mortgage backed securities amounted to billion for as compared to billion for the decrease in principal repayments was due primarily to a reduction in the size of our mortgage backed securities portfolio as a result of the restructuring transaction 
we sold billion of mortgage backed securities during  resulting in a gain of million 
substantially all of the proceeds from the sales of mortgage backed securities were used to repay borrowings as part of the restructuring transaction 
there were no sales of mortgage backed securities during during  purchases of investment securities consisted of the purchase of corporate bonds in the amount of million 
we did not purchase any investment securities during there were million of calls of investment securities during as compared to billion for there were no sales of investment securities during we sold million of investment securities during resulting in a gain of million 
at december   we had mortgage backed securities and investment securities with an amortized cost of billion that were used as collateral for securities sold under agreements to repurchase and at that date we had billion of unencumbered securities 
as part of the membership requirements of the fhlb  we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of fhlb common stock based on our mortgage related assets and borrowings from the fhlb 
during  we had net redemptions of million of fhlb common stock 
during  we had net redemptions of million of fhlb common stock 
the redemptions in and were due to a decrease in the amount of borrowings we had with the fhlb 
our primary financing activities consist of gathering deposits  engaging in wholesale borrowings  repurchases of our common stock and the payment of dividends 
total deposits decreased billion during as compared to an increase of million for deposit flows are typically affected by the level of market interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors  the volatility of equity markets  and other factors 
we lowered our deposit rates during to continue our balance sheet reduction while profitable investment opportunities remain scarce in the current environment since the low yields that are available to us for mortgage related assets and investment securities have made a growth strategy less prudent until market conditions improve 
at december   time deposits scheduled to mature within one year totaled billion with an average cost of 
these time deposits are scheduled to mature as follows billion with an average cost of in the first quarter of  billion with an average cost of in the second quarter of  billion with an average cost of in the third quarter of and billion with an average cost of in the fourth quarter of we anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment 
based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy  we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or as transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing interest rate 
we have  in the past  primarily used wholesale borrowings to fund our investing activities 
during we completed the transactions which reduced our reliance on structured putable borrowings for funding purposes and as part of our overall interest rate risk strategy 
the transactions have improved our overall liquidity position by significantly reducing our reliance on structured putable borrowings 
structured putable borrowings 
table of contents with put dates within one year amounted to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  we anticipate that none of these borrowings will be put back assuming current market interest rates remain stable 
we believe  given current market conditions  that the likelihood that a significant portion of these borrowings would be put back will not increase substantially unless interest rates were to increase by at least basis points 
at december  we had a concentration of borrowings with a single counterparty with billion of borrowings with the fhlb 
we do not believe this concentration creates a material liquidity risk to us 
our remaining borrowings are fixed rate  fixed maturity borrowings of billion with a weighted average rate of 
there are no scheduled maturities within the next twelve months 
our liquidity management process is structured to meet our daily funding needs and cover both expected and unexpected deviations from normal daily operations 
the primary tools we use for measuring and managing liquidity risk include cash flow projections  diversified funding sources  stress testing  a cushion of liquid assets  and a formal  well developed contingency funding plan 
cash dividends paid during were million 
we have not purchased any of our common shares during the year ended december  pursuant to our repurchase programs 
at december   there remained  shares available for purchase under existing stock repurchase programs 
the primary source of liquidity for hudson city bancorp  the holding company of hudson city savings  is capital distributions from hudson city savings 
at december   hudson city bancorp had total cash and due from banks of million 
the primary use of these funds is the payment of dividends to our shareholders and  when appropriate as part of our capital management strategy  the repurchase of our outstanding common stock 
hudson city bancorp s ability to continue these activities is dependent upon capital distributions from hudson city savings 
applicable federal law  regulations and regulatory actions may limit the amount of capital distributions hudson city savings may make 
currently  hudson city savings must seek approval from the occ and the frb for future capital distributions 
in accordance with the bank mou  the bank has adopted and has implemented enhanced operating policies and procedures that will enable us to continue to a reduce our level of interest rate risk  b reduce our funding concentration  c diversify our funding sources  d enhance our liquidity position  e monitor and manage loan modifications and f maintain our capital position in accordance with our existing capital plan 
in addition  we developed a written strategic plan for the bank which establishes various objectives  including  but not limited to  objectives for the bank s overall risk profile  earnings performance  growth and balance sheet mix and to enhance our enterprise risk management program 
the implementation of the strategic plan has been suspended pending the completion of the merger 
in accordance with the company mou  the company must  among other things support the bank s compliance with the bank mou 
the company mou also requires the company to a obtain approval from the frb prior to receiving a capital distribution from the bank or declaring a dividend to shareholders  b obtain approval from the frb prior to repurchasing or redeeming any company stock or incurring any debt with a maturity date of greater than one year and c submit a comprehensive capital plan and a comprehensive earnings plan to the frb 
these agreements will remain in effect until modified or terminated by the occ with respect to the bank mou and the frb with respect to the company mou 
at december   hudson city savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and is in compliance with our capital plan 
hudson city savings tangible capital ratio  leverage core capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were  and  respectively 
we have agreed in the bank mou not to materially deviate from our capital plan without regulatory approval 

table of contents the frb recently issued notices of proposed rulemaking that will subject all savings and loan holding companies  including hudson city bancorp  to consolidated capital requirements 
these proposed rules also revise the quantity and quality of required minimum risk based and leverage capital requirements  consistent with the reform act and the basel iii capital standards  and revise the frb s rules for calculating risk weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity 
the proposed rules provide for various phase in periods over the next several years 
we are continuing to review the impact the reform act  basel iii and the related proposed rule making will have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations hudson city bancorp is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements  which occur in the normal course of our business  to meet the credit needs of our customers and the growth initiatives of the bank 
these arrangements are primarily commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans  and to purchase mortgage backed securities 
we are also obligated under a number of non cancelable operating leases 
the following table summarizes contractual obligations of hudson city by contractual payment period  as of december  payments due by period contractual obligation total less than one year one year to three years three years to five years more than five years in thousands mortgage loan originations mortgage loan purchases repayment of borrowed funds operating leases total commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments to fund first mortgage loans generally have fixed expiration dates of approximately days and other termination clauses 
since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
hudson city savings evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
additionally  we have available home equity  overdraft and commercial construction lines of credit  which do not have fixed expiration dates  of approximately million  million  and million 
we are not obligated to advance further amounts on credit lines if the customer is delinquent  or otherwise in violation of the agreement 
the commitments to purchase first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities had a normal period from trade date to settlement date of approximately days 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires that an entity report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
the amendment does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
the amendment does require that an entity provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
for public entities  the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect this asu will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or financial statement disclosures 

table of contents in december  fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu  which indefinitely defers the requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements for all periods presented 
entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect prior to asu all other requirements in asu are not affected by this update  including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we have reported the required information in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
in september  fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  as described in the accounting guidance 
the guidance in asu also provides entities with the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test and an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
asu does not change current accounting guidance for testing other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed prior to september  this asu did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or financial statement disclosures 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements of hudson city bancorp have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to understanding our financial results 
in addition  note to the audited consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the all  the measurement of stock based compensation expense  the impairment of securities  the impairment of goodwill and the measurement of the funded status and cost of our pension and other post retirement benefit plans involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially 
these critical policies and their application are continually reviewed by management  and are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and our board of directors 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the all has been determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  under which we are required to maintain an adequate all at december  we are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required 
we believe that our all is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses  as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and  to a lesser extent  second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at december  as a result of our lending practices  we also have a concentration of loans secured by real property located primarily in new jersey  new york and connecticut 
at december   approximately of our total loans are in the new york metropolitan area 
additionally  the states of pennsylvania  virginia  illinois and maryland  accounted for    and  respectively of total loans 
the remaining of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate primarily in the remainder of our lending markets 
based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio  we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are the continued weakened economic conditions due to the recent us recession  continued high levels of unemployment  rising interest rates in the markets we lend and a continuing decline in real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these adverse trends may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  non performing assets  loan losses and future levels of loan loss provisions 
we consider these trends in market conditions in determining the all 
due to the nature of our loan portfolio  our evaluation of the adequacy of our all is performed primarily on a pooled basis 
each month we prepare an analysis which categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type fixed and variable one to four family  interest only  reduced documentation  multi family  commercial  construction  etc  loan source originated or purchased and payment status ie  current or number of days delinquent 
loans with known potential losses are categorized separately 
we assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type 
these factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history  delinquency trends  portfolio growth and the status of the regional economy and housing market  in order to ascertain that the loss factors cover probable and estimable losses inherent in the portfolio 
based on our recent loss experience on non performing loans  we changed certain loss factors used in our quantitative analysis of the all for one to four family first mortgage loans during this adjustment in our loss factors did not have a material effect on the ultimate level of our all or on our provision for loan losses 
we use this analysis  as a tool  together with principal balances and delinquency reports  to evaluate the adequacy of the all 
other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located  changes in the trend of non performing loans  the results of our foreclosed property transactions  the current state of the local and national economy  changes in interest rates and loan portfolio growth 
any one or a combination of these adverse trends may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and higher future levels of provisions 
we maintain the all through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income 
we charge losses on loans against the all when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
we establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review as described above 
we apply this process and methodology in a consistent manner and we reassess and modify the estimation methods and assumptions used in response to changing conditions 
such changes  if any  are approved by our aqc each quarter 
hudson city savings defines the population of potential impaired loans to be all non accrual construction  commercial real estate and multi family loans as well as loans classified as troubled debt restructurings 

table of contents impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows 
smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  are specifically excluded from the impaired loan analysis 
we believe that we have established and maintained the all at adequate levels 
additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the all remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
stock based compensation we recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such awards in accordance with asc we have made annual grants of performance based stock options and stock unit awards that vest if certain financial performance measures are met 
in accordance with asc  we assess the probability of achieving these financial performance measures and recognize the cost of these performance based grants if it is probable that the financial performance measures will be met 
this probability assessment is subjective in nature and may change over the assessment period for the performance measures 
we made grants of stock units in for which the sizes of the awards depend in part on market conditions based on the performance of our common stock 
in accordance with asc  we include the impact of these market conditions when estimating the grant date fair value of the awards 
in accordance with asc  we recognize compensation cost for these awards if service conditions are satisfied  even if the market condition is not satisfied 
we estimate the per share fair value of option grants on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for the expected dividend yield  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term 
these assumptions are based on our analysis of our historical option exercise experience and our judgments regarding future option exercise experience and market conditions 
these assumptions are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
the black scholes option pricing model also contains certain inherent limitations when applied to options that are not traded on public markets 
the per share fair value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
in general  the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term  and in the opposite direction of changes in the expected dividend yield 
for example  the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock price volatility increases  risk free interest rate increases  expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases 
the use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options 
pension and other post retirement benefit assumptions non contributory retirement and post retirement defined benefit plans are maintained for certain employees  including retired employees hired on or before july  who have met other eligibility requirements of the plans 
in accordance with asc  retirement benefits  we a recognize in the statement of financial condition an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  b measure plan assets and obligations that determine the plan s funded status as of the end of our fiscal year  and c recognize  in comprehensive income  changes in the funded status of our defined benefit post retirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
we provide our actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring our benefit obligation 
we monitor these rates in relation to the current market interest rate environment and update our actuarial analysis 
table of contents accordingly 
the most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period end present value of the benefit obligations  and the expense to be included in the following year s financial statements 
a lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense  while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense 
the discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow yield curve model specific to our pension and post retirement plans 
we compare this rate to certain market indices  such as long term treasury bonds  or the moody s bond indices  for reasonableness 
for our pension plan  a discount rate of was selected for the december  measurement date and the expense calculation 
for our pension plan  we also assumed an annual rate of salary increase of for future periods 
this rate is corresponding to actual salary increases experienced over prior years 
we assumed a return on plan assets of for future periods 
we actuarially determine the return on plan assets based on actual plan experience over the previous ten years 
the actual return on plan assets was for and for there can be no assurances with respect to actual return on plan assets in the future 
we continually review and evaluate all actuarial assumptions affecting the pension plan  including assumed return on assets 
for our post retirement benefit plan  a discount rate of was used for the december  measurement date and was used for the expense calculation 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of other benefits for was 
the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to for and remain at that level thereafter 
changes to the assumed health care cost trend rate are expected to have an immaterial impact as we capped our obligations to contribute to the premium cost of coverage to the post retirement health benefit plan at the premium level 
securities impairment our available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
debt securities which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the fair values for our securities are obtained from an independent nationally recognized pricing service 
on a monthly basis  we assess the reasonableness of the fair values obtained by reference to a second independent nationally recognized pricing service 
substantially all of our securities portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities and debt securities issued by gses 
the fair value of these securities is primarily impacted by changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds 
at december   we had million of corporate bonds which were purchased during we generally view changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary  which is consistent with our experience 
accounting guidance requires an entity to assess whether an other than temporary impairment exists for debt securities and the amount of the impairment to be recognized in earnings 
as part of that assessment  the entity must determine its intent and ability to hold the security 
if the entity intends to sell the debt security  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred 
in addition  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if a decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
our evaluation of other than temporary impairment considers the duration and severity of the impairment  our intent and ability to hold the securities  whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost and our assessments of the reason for the decline in value and the likelihood of a near term recovery 
the unrealized losses on securities in our portfolio were due primarily to changes in market interest rates subsequent to purchase 
as a result  the unrealized losses on our securities were not considered to be other than temporary and  accordingly  no impairment loss was recognized during 
table of contents impairment of goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value based two step approach 
goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to million and were recorded as a result of hudson city bancorp s acquisition of sound federal bancorp  inc in the first step step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
as a community oriented bank  substantially all of the company s operations involve the delivery of loan and deposit products to customers and these operations constitute the company s only segment for financial reporting purposes 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step step is performed to measure the amount 
step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which impairment was indicated in step the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities  and identifiable intangibles  as if the reporting unit was being acquired at the impairment test date 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for measurement  when available 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  we utilized multiple approaches in estimating the fair value of the company as of our impairment test dates including i a comparable transactions approach based on acquisition pricing multiples or ratios recently paid in the sale or merger of relatively comparable banking franchises  ii a control premium approach based on the company s trading price adjusted by a premium for acquiring control based on control premium data for recent banking sales or mergers  iii a public market peers control premium approach based on the trading prices of similar publicly traded companies as measured by standard valuation multiples or ratios adjusted by a premium for acquiring control based on control premium data for recent banking sales or mergers  and  iv the discounted cash flow approach whereby value is determined based on the present value of the sum of the projected dividends and a terminal value in the future 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of june  we also perform interim impairment reviews if an event or circumstances occur which may indicate that the fair value of the company is less than the company s book value 
the company announced the merger in the third quarter of the merger price based on the closing price of m t s common stock on august   the last trading day before the announcement of the merger and based on the average of m t s common stock from the announcement date to september   was and  respectively or a fair value of billion for the company based on the merger price and shares outstanding on august  since this amount is less than the reported amount of shareholders equity  we re assessed goodwill for impairment at september  by performing step of the goodwill impairment test 
for step of the goodwill impairment test  we compared the fair value of the company as determined by the merger price with the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the company to calculate an implied goodwill 
based on our step analysis  the implied goodwill of the company exceeded the carrying value of goodwill 
the results of the step analysis are highly sensitive to the measurement of the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities 
based on the results of the goodwill impairment analyses we completed in  we concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
therefore  we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets during the estimation of the fair value of the company requires the use of estimates and 
table of contents assumptions that results in a greater degree of uncertainty 
in addition  the estimated fair value of the company is based on  among other things  the market price of our common stock as calculated per the terms of the merger 
as a result of the current volatility in market and economic conditions  these estimates and assumptions are subject to change in the near term and may result in the impairment in future periods of some or all of the goodwill on our balance sheet 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk general as a financial institution  our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
our net income is primarily based on net interest income  and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those that possess a short term to maturity 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
we do not own any trading assets 
we did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps during and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at december  our loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios  which comprise of our balance sheet  are subject to risks associated with the economy in the new york metropolitan area  the general economy of the united states and the recent pressure on housing prices 
we continually analyze our asset quality and believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover known or potential losses 
management of interest rate risk the primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet  determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan  the current economic environment and our capital and liquidity requirements  and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our board of directors 
we seek to manage our asset liability mix to help minimize the impact that interest rate fluctuations may have on our earnings and capital 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  our asset liability committee meets regularly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products 
this committee consists of the chief executive officer  the president and chief operating officer  the chief financial officer  the chief risk officer and other senior officers of the company 
the asset liability committee presents reports to the enterprise risk management committee at its regular meetings 
historically  our lending activities have emphasized one to four family fixed rate first mortgage loans  while purchasing variable rate or hybrid mortgage backed securities to diversify our predominantly fixed rate loan portfolio 
the current prevailing interest rate environment and the desires of our customers have resulted in a demand for longer term hybrid and fixed rate mortgage loans 
these fixed rate interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these interest earning 
table of contents assets would not reprice to current market interest rates as fast as the interest rates on our interest bearing deposits and our remaining putable borrowed funds 
in the past several years  we have attempted to originate and purchase a larger percentage of variable rate mortgage related assets in order to better manage our interest rate risk 
variable rate mortgage related assets include those loans or securities with a contractual annual rate adjustment after an initial fixed rate period of one to ten years 
these variable rate instruments are more rate sensitive  given the potential interest rate adjustment  than the long term fixed rate loans that we have traditionally held in our portfolio 
growth in variable rate mortgage related assets would help reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and is expected to benefit our long term profitability  as the rate earned on the mortgage loan will increase as prevailing market rates increase 
however  this strategy to originate a higher percentage of variable rate instruments may have an initial adverse impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in the short term  as variable rate interest earning assets generally have initial interest rates lower than alternative fixed rate investments 
variable rate hybrid products constituted of originated and purchased loans and of mortgage backed securities made during in the aggregate  of our mortgage related assets were variable rate or hybrid instruments 
our percentage of fixed rate mortgage related assets to total mortgage related assets was as of december  compared with as of december  the decrease in this ratio was primarily due to increased variable rate loan origination and principal pay down on purchased and originated fixed rate loans 
however  included in the variable rate hybrid total are mortgage related assets whose contractual next rate change date is over five years 
if these instruments were classified as fixed rate  the percentage of fixed rate mortgage related assets to total mortgage related assets would be as of december  overall  our percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets was at december  compared with as of december  our primary sources of funds have traditionally been deposits  consisting primarily of time deposits and interest bearing demand accounts  and borrowings 
our deposits have substantially shorter terms to maturity than our mortgage loan portfolio and borrowed funds 
the bank currently has billion of non maturity deposits and billion of time deposits scheduled to mature within the next months 
of the billion in non maturity deposits  billion are in money market demand accounts  which is a decrease of billion from december  the borrowings have generally had longer terms to maturity  in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk 
the amount and mix of borrowings on our balance sheet as of the year ended december  is contrasted with that of the year ended december  in the table below 
in thousands structured borrowings quarterly put option one time put option fixed rate fixed maturity borrowings total borrowed funds as the above table indicates  a majority of our borrowed funds are putable at the discretion of the issuer after an initial no put period 
as a result  if interest rates were to decrease  or stay at current levels  these borrowings would probably not be put back to us and our average cost of existing borrowings would not decrease even as market interest rates decrease 
conversely  if interest rates increase above the market interest rate for similar 
table of contents borrowings  these borrowings would likely be put back to us at their next put date and our cost to replace these borrowings would increase 
since market interest rates have remained very low for an extended period of time  we have not had any lenders put borrowings back to us 
as a result  many of our quarterly putable borrowings have become putable within three months 
of the billion reported  billion  with a weighted average rate of  could be put back to the company during any three month period 
we believe  given current market conditions  that the likelihood that a significant portion of these borrowings would be put back to us will not increase substantially unless interest rates were to increase by at least basis points 
the billion of one time putable borrowings  with a weighted average rate of  were placed on the balance sheet as a result of modifying previously existing quarterly putable borrowings into one time putable borrowings 
the next put option for any of this type of borrowing will be september there are billion of fixed rate fixed maturity borrowings with a weighted average rate of 
none of these borrowings are schedule to mature before the difference between rates on the yield curve  or the shape of the yield curve  impacts our net interest income 
the fomc noted that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months  apart from weather related disruptions  although the unemployment rate remains elevated 
the fomc noted that while the housing sector and household spending continue to show signs of improvement  growth in business fixed investment has slowed 
the national unemployment rate was in december  a decline from an unemployment rate in december the fomc decided to maintain the overnight lending rate at zero to during the fourth quarter of and stated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 
previously  the fomc stated that these levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid as a result  market interest rates have remained at low levels  and consequently  the yields on our mortgage related assets have continued to decrease during the fomc decided to expand its accommodative monetary policy by purchasing an additional billion of agency mortgage backed securities per month to ensure that inflation is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate regarding both inflation and unemployment 
in addition  during the federal reserve will purchase longer term treasury securities initially at a pace of billion per month 
this follows the completion of operation twist at the end of these programs will continue to put downward pressure on longer term interest rates 
as a result  both short term and long term market interest rates have remained at low levels or decreased during  with the long term rates decreasing more than short term rates thus flattening the market yield curve 
the current interest rate environment has allowed us to continue to re price lower our short term time and non maturity deposits  thereby reducing our cost of funds  and has also allowed us to price medium term time deposits year maturities at lower rates and extend the weighted average remaining maturity on this portfolio 
however  the overall lower longer term market interest rates resulted in lower rates on our primary investments of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  the low market interest rates resulted in accelerated prepayment speeds on these assets as customers sought to refinance their current debt to the lower market rates 
due to our investment and financing decisions  the more positive the slope of the yield curve the more favorable the environment is for our ability to generate net interest income 
our interest bearing liabilities generally reflect movements in short and intermediate term rates  while our interest earning assets  a majority of which have initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year  generally reflect movements in intermediate and long term interest rates 
a positive slope of the yield curve allows us to invest in interest 
table of contents earning assets at a wider spread to the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
during a more stable short term rate environment as compared to a declining long term rate environment  resulted in a flatter market yield curve 
also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our interest sensitive assets 
the actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  availability of credit  seasonal factors and demographic variables 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition 
generally  the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets  as the payments received on the interest earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing lower market interest rate 
prepayment rates are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate  thus  as market interest rates increase  prepayment rates tend to decrease 
prepayment rates on our mortgage related assets have remained at elevated levels during accordingly  we have used relatively high levels of prepayment activity in our interest rate risk modeling presented below 
the low levels of interest rates that prevailed during also spurred the call of a single us agency callable security  par value of million 
on the liability side  our borrowings have traditionally consisted of structured putable borrowings with ten year final maturities and initial non put periods of one to five years 
the likelihood of a borrowing being put back is directly related to the current market interest rates  meaning the higher that interest rates move  the more likely the borrowing would be put back 
the level of put activity generally affects the cost of our borrowed funds  as the put of a borrowing would generally necessitate the re borrowing of the funds or deposit growth at the higher current market interest rates 
during we experienced no put activity on our borrowed funds due to the continued low levels of market interest rates 
we do not believe a significant amount of these borrowings will be put back to us unless rates increase in excess of basis points 
in  the bank choose to not to replace the short term borrowings as they matured 
the company used cash flows from mortgage related assets which reduced the size of the balance sheet 
interest rate risk modeling simulation model 
we use our internal simulation models as our primary means to calculate and monitor the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio 
these models report changes to net interest income and the net present value of equity in different interest rate environments  assuming either an incremental or instantaneous and permanent parallel interest rate shock  as applicable  to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
we assume maturing or called instruments are reinvested into like product  with the rate earned or paid reset to our currently offered rate for loans and deposits  or the current market rate for securities and borrowed funds 
we have not reported the minus or minus basis point interest rate shock scenarios in either of our simulation model analyses  as we believe  given the current interest rate environment and historical interest rate levels  the resulting information would not be meaningful 
net interest income 
as a primary means of managing interest rate risk  we monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income over the next twelve month period 
this model does not purport to provide estimates of net interest income over the next twelve month period  but attempts to assess the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income 
the following table reports the changes to our net interest income over the next months ending december  assuming either incremental or instantaneous changes in interest rates for the given rate shock scenarios 
the incremental interest rate changes occur over a month period 

table of contents change in percent change in net interest income interest rates incremental change instantaneous change basis points of note in the positive shock scenarios the longer term putable borrowings do not affect net interest income due to the lack of puts on the putable borrowings in this low current market interest rates and the fixed rate fixed maturity borrowings do not significantly affect net interest income since a majority of these borrowings do not mature over the next months  and the increase in income from total interest earning assets is in effect offset by the increase in deposit and short term borrowing expense 
of note in the negative shock scenarios the decrease in net interest income in the instantaneous shock analysis is due to the accelerated prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets and the re investment of the proceeds into lower yielding instruments  and the decrease is also due to the lack of change in the cost of the billion of putable borrowed funds  as they will not be put back in the lower interest rate environment and will persist to maturity 
net present value of equity 
we also monitor our interest rate risk by monitoring changes in the net present value of equity in the different rate environments 
the net present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities 
their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie  fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  and floors relative to the current interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline  whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
increases in the fair value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity 
conversely  increases in the fair value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the fair value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity 

table of contents the following table presents the estimated net present value of equity over a range of parallel interest rate change scenarios  as applicable  at december  the present value ratio shown in the table is the net present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments 
our current policy sets a minimum ratio of the net present value of equity to the fair value of assets in the current interest rate environment no rate shock of and a minimum present value ratio of in the plus basis point interest rate shock scenario 
change in interest rates present value ratio basis point change basis points of note in the positive shock scenarios the relative stability of our net present value ratios reflects the current low interest rate environment and the fact that our putable borrowings will not be put back to us until a rate change in excess of basis points and we have a larger percent of the borrowings in fixed rate fixed maturity instruments  which allows the price of the borrowings to move in a similar manner as the price moves of our interest earning assets  and our deposits  as they are relatively short term in nature  do not have significant price changes in the shock scenarios 
of note in the negative shock scenarios the decrease in the present value ratio in the negative basis point changes was primarily due to higher pricing of our putable borrowed funds as the structures will increase in duration  and the value of our mortgage related assets will remain closer to par than the borrowings as the prepayment speeds increase thus shortening the duration of these portfolios 
the methods we use in simulation modeling are inherently imprecise 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve  regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing 
the analyses assume that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the previous two tables may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income or present value of equity 
gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 

table of contents a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the costs of its interest bearing liabilities relative to the yields of its interest earning assets and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income 
an institution with a positive gap position would be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience the opposite result 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income 
the following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except for prepayment or call activity and non maturity deposit decay rates  we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to rate reset or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
assumptions used for decay rates are based on the bank s experience with the particular deposit type 
prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets are based on recent experience 
callable investment securities and borrowed funds are reported at the anticipated call or put date  for those that are callable or putable within one year  or at their contractual maturity date or next interest rate step up date  as applicable 
we reported million of investment securities at their anticipated call date 
we have reported no borrowings at their anticipated put date due to the low interest rate environment 
we have excluded non accrual mortgage loans of billion and non accrual other loans of million from the table 
at december  more than more than more than more than two years three years six months six months one year to to three to five more than or less to one year two years years years five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets first mortgage loans consumer and other loans federal funds sold mortgage backed securities fhlb stock investment securities total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts interest bearing demand accounts money market accounts time deposits borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percent of interest bearing liabilities 
table of contents of note regarding the gap analysis we have no borrowings maturing within the next months  and we have experienced elevated levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets as interest rates have continued to decrease over the year 
of note in comparison to december  the cumulative one year gap as a percent of total assets was positive at december  vs 
at december   during  billion of borrowings matured and were not replaced  and deposits also declined during  by billion 
the methods used in the gap table are also inherently imprecise 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
if interest rates change  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase
