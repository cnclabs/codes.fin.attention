item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors or in other parts of this annual report on form k 
overview we develop and provide the leading software and hardware solutions for digital investigations  including encase enterprise  a network enabled product primarily for corporations and government agencies  and encase forensic  a desktop based product primarily for law enforcement agencies and digital investigators 
we were incorporated and commenced operations in from through  we generated a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of our encase forensic products and related services 
we have experienced increases in our revenue as a result of the release of our encase enterprise products in late  which expanded our customer base into corporate enterprises and federal government agencies 
in addition  the releases of our encase ediscovery solution in late and encase information assurance solution in late which was replaced by our encase cybersecurity solution in have increased our average transaction size 
in may  we added a family of data acquisition forensic hardware products including forensic duplicators  multiple write blockers and other hardware through our acquisition of tableau  llc tableau 
in february  we added cloud based document review and production software as a service for corporations and law firms through our acquisition of casecentral  inc casecentral we anticipate that sales of our encase enterprise products and related services  in particular our encase ediscovery and encase cybersecurity solutions  sales of our forensic hardware products and sales of subscriptions for cloud based document review and production saas will comprise a substantial portion of our future revenues 
important factors affecting our results of operations there are a number of trends that may affect our business and our industry 
we have identified factors that we expect to play an important role in our future growth and profitability 
some of these trends or other factors include legislative and regulatory developments 
our digital investigation solutions allow law enforcement agencies  government organizations and corporations to conduct investigations within the legal and regulatory framework 
historically  the implementation of new laws and regulations surrounding digital investigations has helped create demand for our products 
future changes in applicable laws or regulations could enhance or detract from the desirability of our products 
information technology budgets 
deployment of our solutions may require a substantial capital expenditure by our customers 
budgets for information technology related capital expenditures at corporations and all levels of government organizations are typically cyclical in nature  with generally higher budgets in times of improving economic conditions and lower budgets in times of economic slowdowns 

table of contents law enforcement agency budgets 
we sell our encase forensic products and training services primarily to law enforcement agencies 
because of the limited nature of law enforcement budgets  funds are typically initially allocated toward solving issues perceived to be the most pressing 
sales of our products could be impacted by changes in the budgets of law enforcement agencies or in the relative priority assigned to digital law enforcement investigations 
prevalence and impact of hacking incidents and spread of malicious software 
the increasing sophistication of hacking attacks on government and private networks and the global spread of malicious software  such as viruses  worms and rootkits  have increased the focus of corporations and large government organizations on digital investigations and other aspects of network security  which has  in turn  increased demand for our products 
future changes in the number and severity of such attacks or the spread of malicious software could have an effect on the demand for our products 
seasonality in revenues 
we experience seasonality in our revenues  with the third and fourth quarters typically having the highest revenues for the year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from our customers budgeting cycles 
the federal government budget year ends in the third calendar quarter of the year and a majority of corporate budget years end in the fourth calendar quarter of the year 
in addition  our customers also tend to make software purchases near the end of a particular quarter  which tends to make our revenues for a particular period unpredictable for a significant portion of that period 
we expect that this seasonality within particular years and unpredictability within particular quarterly periods will continue for the foreseeable future 
amount of commercial litigation 
because commercial litigation often involves e discovery  an increase in commercial litigation could increase demand for our products and services  while a decrease in commercial litigation could decrease demand 
summary of results of operations our total revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from product revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from subscription revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to none in services and maintenance revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the increase in our total revenue for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to sales of our new subscription based products due to our acquisition of casecentral in february  increased services and maintenance revenue as a result of sustained increases in our installed product base and high annual renewals by our customers  and growth in the enterprise software market which lead to increased sales of our encase enterprise family of products 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for our profitability is primarily dependent upon revenue from the sale of our products 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the increase was primarily the result of increased sales of subscription based products and professional services 
profitability is also affected by the costs and expenses associated with developing  selling and marketing our products 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from  due primarily to increases in selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses and research and development costs 
sources of revenue our software product sales transactions typically include the following elements i a software license fee paid for the use of our products under a perpetual license term  or for a specific term  ii an arrangement for first year support and maintenance  which includes unspecified software updates  upgrades and post contract support  iii and professional services for installation  implementation  consulting and training 
with our acquisition of casecentral in february  we began to generate revenue from cloud based document review and production software sold as subscription services 
we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our software products 
we sell our software products and services primarily through our direct sales force and in some cases we utilize resellers 
we sell our hardware products primarily through resellers

table of contents product revenues we generate product revenues principally from two product categories enterprise products and forensic products 
our enterprise products include perpetual licenses and pay per use fees related to our encase enterprise  ediscovery  and encase cybersecurity 
our forensic products include revenue related to encase forensic  encase portable  and forensic hardware sales 
our forensic products also include our premium license support program plsp product  which was sold on a subscription basis for a term of one or three years  sales of plsp ended in june when we introduced encase forensic v during the first two quarters of each fiscal year  we typically experience our lowest levels of product sales due to the seasonal budgetary cycles of our customers 
the third quarter is typically the strongest quarter for sales to our federal government customers 
typically  sales to our corporate customers are highest in the fourth quarter 
product revenues increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  from the increase was primarily due to increases in enterprise product revenues and forensic hardware revenues  partially offset by lower forensic software revenues 
enterprise product revenues increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  from  primarily due to an increase in the number of new encase enterprise customers resulting from additional functionality made available in our enterprise products and an increase in sales to existing customers 
during the year ended december  we added new encase enterprise customers  as compared to for the year ended december  during  of enterprise product revenues were the result of sales to existing customers  compared to in forensic hardware revenue increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  from  primarily due to increased sales of new versions of our hardware products that were made available during the year 
the increases in enterprise product revenues and forensic hardware revenues were offset by a decrease in forensic software revenues of million  or  from million for the year ended december  from the decrease in forensic software revenues was due to the initial release of the latest version of our encase forensic product in june  which generated increased demand for that product in as compared to product revenues increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  from  primarily due to a million  or  increase in forensic product revenues 
the increase in forensic product revenues was due to a million  or  increase in forensic software revenues and a million  or  increase in forensic hardware revenues 
the increase in forensic software revenues was primarily due to increased sales volume of the latest version of our encase forensic software product released in june the increase in forensic hardware revenues was primarily due to the inclusion of a full twelve months of sales in of the forensic hardware products that we acquired through our acquisition of tableau in may as compared to our forensic hardware revenues in  which included only approximately eight months of such sales 
enterprise product revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  from this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales to our customers resulting from additional functionality made available in our enterprise products during the year 
subscription revenues with our acquisition of casecentral in february  we began to generate revenue from cloud based document review and production software sold as subscription services 
subscription service customers have the right to access our cloud based document review and production software  however  they may not take possession of the software at any time during the term of the agreement 
in general  we recognize revenue for subscriptions on a straight line basis over the contract period commencing on the date the subscription is made available to the customer 
usage based fees  which are determined monthly  are recognized when incurred 
subscription revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with none in we started to earn revenue from cloud based document review and production software products in february as a result of our acquisition of casecentral 
services and maintenance revenues services and maintenance revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   from services revenues increased million  or from million  for the year ended december   from  primarily due to an increase of million in professional services revenues related to our acquisition of casecentral in february and a million increase in training revenue 
the increase in training revenue was primarily due to increased demand for training courses related to new product releases 
maintenance revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   from primarily as a result of sustained increases in our installed product base and high annual renewal rates by customers desiring continuing maintenance support on our products 
in our installed product base increased primarily through the addition of new encase enterprise customers and sales of new encase e discovery and encase cybersecurity modules to existing encase enterprise customers 

table of contents services and maintenance revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   from services revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december   from  primarily due to revenue from certain significant one time consulting engagements performed during the first six months of maintenance revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   from  primarily as a result of sustained increases in our installed product base and high annual renewal rates by customers desiring continuing maintenance support on our products

while these costs are primarily variable with respect to sales volumes  they remain low in relation to the revenue generated and result in higher gross margins than our services and training businesses 
our gross margins can be affected by product mix  as our enterprise products are generally higher margin products than our forensic products  which include software and hardware 
cost of product revenues increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   from the increase was primarily a result of an increase in forensic hardware product revenues 
product gross margin decreased slightly to in from in primarily due to a million increase in sales of forensic hardware products to million  or of product sales

the cost of services and maintenance revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december   from the increase in the cost of services and maintenance revenues in from was due primarily to increases in compensation and related expenses  associated with higher revenues and higher utilization rates in our professional services organization  as well as an increase in third party consultants on certain engagements 
third party consultants  which are generally more expensive than our own professional services consultants  are used mostly when the demand for our own consultants exceeds our internal capacity

general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million  for the year ended december   from approximately million of the increase was due to acquisition and integration related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of casecentral in february   approximately million of the increase was due to an increase in legal fees primarily due to legal fees incurred in connection with patent infringement complaints filed in  and approximately million of the increase was due to increased compensation costs and other employee and facility related expenses of which approximately million was due to the casecentral acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by a charge in the first quarter of of million related to certain state sales tax obligations including related interest and penalties

in december  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share  for net proceeds of million in our initial public offering 
we have largely financed our operations from the cash flow generated from the sale of our products and services 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
on february   we acquired casecentral  a privately held a provider of cloud based document review and production software for approximately million  consisting of million in cash net of million in cash acquired  million in company common stock and contingent consideration with an acquisition date fair value of million 
depending on casecentral s saas revenue over the three month periods starting april   we may be required to pay up to a maximum of million in cash to casecentral s former shareholders with respect to those periods 
we incurred million in acquisition related costs 
the transaction closed on february  and the results of operations of casecentral have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements subsequent to that date 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
changes in cash flow we generate cash from operating activities primarily from cash collections related to the sale of our products and services 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with million in the decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily a result of an increase in deferred revenue of million in compared to an increase of million in  a decrease in accrued liabilities of  in compared to an increase of million in  partially offset by an increase in trade receivables of million in compared to an increase of million in and depreciation and amortization of million in compared to million in net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with million in the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily a result of an increase in deferred revenue of million in compared to a decrease in deferred revenue of million in  a decrease in our net loss to million from million in  partially offset by an increase in trade receivables of million in compared to a decrease of million in net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in net cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to our acquisition of casecentral in february the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in was due to the acquisition of tableau in may for the net cash purchase price of million

cash used in financing activities in included million of repurchases and withholdings of common stock  partially offset by million in proceeds from stock option exercises and lower principal payments on our capital lease obligations 
on july   we entered into a loan and security agreement loan agreement with a bank 
the loan agreement creates a line of credit to provide for one or more revolving loans  non revolving loans or term loans and up to million in standby letters of credit 
the maximum principal amount of loans that may be outstanding at any given time under the loan agreement  including standby letters of credit  is million 
any borrowings under the loan agreement would be collateralized by substantially all our assets 
the loan agreement requires that we remain in compliance with certain financial covenants  including that we maintain unrestricted cash and marketable securities of not less than million  that we maintain a ratio of total funded indebtedness to ebitda of not greater than to  that we maintain a ratio of cash flow to current portion of long term debt of not less than to  and that we shall not allow a cumulative net loss of more than million during any fiscal year 
there were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit and we were in compliance with the covenants associated with the revolving line of credit as of december  borrowings under the loan agreement bear interest at one of the following rates as selected by us a rate equal to the bank s alternate base rate plus or libor plus 
all principal  interest and other amounts owing under the loan agreement will be due and payable in full on or prior to june  the loan agreement supersedes and replaces our amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of may   which would have expired on august  
table of contents as of december   we had three outstanding stand by letters of credit in the amounts of   and million related to three of our facility leases and another outstanding stand by letter of credit in the amount of  related to equipment leases  all secured by substantially all our assets 
the available borrowing under the loan agreement at december  is million 
contractual obligations and commitments in connection with the casecentral acquisition  we may be required to pay former casecentral shareholders a total of up to million with respect to the three month periods earn out periods starting april  the amount of contingent consideration payable with respect to each of the earn out periods is equal to of certain qualifying casecentral saas revenues and encase ediscovery revenues in excess of million during each of the three earn out periods and is limited to million for the first earn out period  a cumulative total of million for the first and second earn out periods and a cumulative total of million for all three earn out periods 
any earn out consideration is payable within days after the end of the applicable earn out period 
at december   the fair value of the contingent consideration  which is calculated by summing the present values of various probability weighted possible outcomes  was estimated to be million and was included as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   other than the casecentral contingent consideration  our outstanding contractual cash commitments were largely limited to our non cancelable lease obligations  primarily relating to office facilities  as follows payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations  including interest non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our selling and marketing activities  the timing and extent of research and development spending to support product development and enhancement efforts  costs associated with expansion into new territories or markets  the timing of the introduction of new products and services  the enhancement of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
to the extent that our existing cash  cash from operations or the availability of cash under our line of credit are insufficient to fund our future activities and planned growth  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
furthermore  although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation or foreign exchange markets on our operations  we do not believe these external economic forces have had  or are likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on our results of operations 
we have omitted unrecognized tax benefits from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing and recognition related to these unrecognized tax benefits 
see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item for further information regarding the unrecognized tax benefits 
on july   we entered into an office lease agreement the lease to lease approximately  rentable square feet of an office building located in pasadena  california 
the lease begins on august  and has an initial term of ten years and ten months 
the lease will allow the company to consolidate its pasadena  california operations into a single location 
the total annual rent under the lease ranges from approximately million for the first year to approximately million for the final year of the lease 
the company has two options to extend the lease  each for a period of five years 
during the twelve months ended december   the company entered into a million third party software license agreement authorizing the company to integrate database software as a component of its products through november the agreement also provides for maintenance and support over a two year period for million  which may be renewed by the company at the expiration of the two year period ending november the million is payable in eight quarterly installments of  through january payments of million under the agreement were made during the twelve months ended december  the license  maintenance and remaining liability have been recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
other than the items stated above  we currently have no other material cash commitments  except our normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals  leases and license obligations  all of which are currently expected to be funded through existing working capital and future cash flows from operations 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the sec s regulation s k 
we do not have material relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed in this report 
stock repurchases in august  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
under the authorization  the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors  such as levels of cash generation from operations  market conditions and our share price 
repurchased shares are held in treasury stock and have not been retired 
as of december   we had approximately million remaining under this authorization 
in addition to the shares we have repurchased on the open market  we withheld approximately   and  common shares in  and  respectively  from employees to satisfy their personal income tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of share awards issued under our equity compensation plans during the quarter 
withheld shares are held in treasury stock and have not been retired 
the company may engage in similar transactions from time to time related to future vesting of employee restricted stock awards 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below and in note to our consolidated financial statements  included herein at item  have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider them to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
there have been no significant changes in those critical accounting policies and estimates during the twelve months ended december  revenue recognition we generate revenues principally from the sale of encase enterprise and encase forensic software products 
revenue associated with the sale of software licenses and revenue associated with forensic hardware sales are referred to as product revenues 
with the acquisition of casecentral in february of  we now have revenue associated with cloud based document review and production software as a service which is referred to as subscription revenue 
revenues are also generated from training courses  implementation services and consulting services in which we assist customers with the performance of digital investigations and train their it and legal professionals in the use of our software products  which we collectively refer to as services revenues 
our proprietary products are generally sold with one to three years of maintenance  which can be renewed at a stated renewal rate and is referred to as maintenance revenues 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  amendment to accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition  software industry revenue recognition topic asc and revenue recognition asc 
while the standards govern the basis for revenue recognition  significant judgment and the use of estimates are required in connection with the allocation of revenue between product  subscription  services and maintenance revenues  as well as the amount of deferred revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
in general  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable  as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement if we either enter into contracts or receive written purchase orders issued by a customer that legally bind us and the customer  we consider that as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery we deem delivery of products to have occurred when the title and risk of ownership have passed to the buyer 
services revenue is recognized as services are performed 
fixed or determinable fee we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and the payment terms are within normal established practices 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
collection is deemed probable we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we have a reasonable basis to expect that the customer will pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 

table of contents however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue reported 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total purchase price irrespective of invoiced allocations among the various elements we deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
the vsoe of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for software license updates and product support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
if we were to change our pricing practices or any of our other assumptions or judgments in the future  our future revenue recognition could differ significantly from our historical results 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements when revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
when arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting  the consideration is allocated at inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy  which includes vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
vsoe 
vsoe is determined based on its historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
tpe 
when vsoe cannot be established for deliverables in a multiple element arrangement  judgment is applied with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that comparable pricing of services with similar functionality has not been obtained 
furthermore  we have been unable to reliably determine selling prices of similar competitive services on a stand alone basis 
as a result  we have not been able to establish selling prices based on tpe 
besp 
when vsoe or tpe is unable to be established  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for deliverables by considering multiple factors including but not limited to prices we charge for similar offerings  market conditions  competitive landscape and pricing practices 
we have established vsoe for our proprietary products and services  but have not established vsoe or tpe for our subscription services or usage based fee arrangements and therefore we use besp to allocate the selling price to subscription services and usage based fee deliverables 
product revenues 
the timing of product revenue recognition is dependent on the nature of the product sold 
we do not have any product offerings where software components and non software components function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality 
product arrangements comprising multiple deliverables  including software and hardware  are generally categorized into one of the following encase enterprise  encase forensic  encase ediscovery  and related products license revenue associated with these arrangements  exclusive of amounts allocated to maintenance and other undelivered elements for which we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
hardware revenue associated with the sale of forensic hardware is recognized upon shipment to the customer  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

table of contents subscription revenues 
customers pay subscription fees to access our cloud based document review and production software  however  they may not take possession of the software at any time during the term of the agreement 
in general  we recognize revenue for subscription fees on a straight line basis over the contract period commencing on the date the subscription is made available to the customer 
usage based fees  which are determined monthly  are recognized when incurred 
services and maintenance revenues 
services and maintenance revenue consists of professional services  training  and maintenance 
revenue from such services is generally recognized as the services are provided 
training revenues are either recognized on a per class basis upon a participant s attendance or  for those customers who have subscribed to our annual training passport program  revenue is recognized ratably over the annual period 
we refer to revenue related to technical product support and software updates on a when and if available basis as maintenance revenue  which is recognized ratably over the applicable contractual period 
we determine the amount of maintenance revenue to be deferred through reference to substantive maintenance renewal provisions contained in each arrangement 
we consider substantive maintenance provisions to be provisions where the cost of the maintenance renewal  stated in the contract with our customer as a percentage of the product fee  is comparable to the normal pricing for maintenance only renewals 
substantially all of our customers purchase maintenance support when they acquire new software licenses and substantially all renew their maintenance support contracts annually or otherwise 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles we account for our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with intangibles goodwill and other asc 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired and is assigned to a reporting unit at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but evaluated for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value may not be recoverable 
a two step test is performed at the reporting unit level to assess goodwill for impairment 
first  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  the reporting unit is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
the second step is performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their fair values 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
application of the impairment test requires significant judgment to estimate the fair value 
changes in estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or impairment 
we performed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles related to the tableau acquisition as of april  goodwill was assessed at the reporting unit level for hardware products which is one level below our reportable segment level 
we determined the fair value of the reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 
we will perform our annual impairment test for goodwill related to the casecentral acquisition as of january  share based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of share based payments and recognize that cost  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the determination of the grant date fair value of share based awards using that model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the estimated number of years that we expect employees to hold their stock options the option term and our expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and dividends to be paid on our stock over that term 
the expected term life of stock option awards has been calculated using the simplified method because we lacked sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 
we lacked this historical data because of two factors first  our equity incentive plan the plan was adopted in and we do not have a sufficient history of exercises and forfeitures over the typical year life of our awards to predict future option holder behavior  which is critical in estimating an expected term for our options  and  second  we believe that our december initial public offering has likely changed the historical patterns that were experienced during the brief period of time from the plan s adoption to our initial public offering 
the volatility of our common stock is estimated at the date of grant based on a weighted average of the implied volatility of publicly traded day to day options on the common stock of a select peer group of similar companies similar companies  the historical volatility of the common stock of similar companies and  beginning in late  the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate used in option valuation is based on the implied yield in effect at the time of each option grant  based on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent expected terms 
we use a dividend yield of zero in the black scholes model  as we have no intention to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
compensation stock compensation also requires that we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can potentially have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 

table of contents if we change the terms of our employee share based compensation programs  refine future assumptions or if we change to other acceptable valuation models  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from historical trends and could materially affect our results of operations 
as of december   there was approximately  of total unrecognized share based compensation cost related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and approximately million of total unrecognized share based compensation cost related to restricted stock awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we expect to record approximately million in share based compensation in related to options and restricted stock awards outstanding at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is established through a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer accounts receivable  through consideration of the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
in addition  we analyze our historical credit loss history and apply these loss rates to our current accounts receivable balances to verify the reasonableness of our allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in the future  which would result in increased general and administrative expense 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the foreign and domestic jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities will be established if necessary 
although we believe our judgments  assumptions and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known  which can significantly impact our effective tax rate 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
on january   we adopted the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the standard also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for tax contingencies 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we periodically evaluate all pending or threatened contingencies and commitments  if any  that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position 
we assess the probability of an adverse outcome and determine if it is remote  reasonably possible or probable as defined in accordance with the provisions of contingencies asc 
if management determines that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of our financial statements  and the amount of the loss  or the range of probable loss can be reasonably estimated  we record an accrued liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of the conditions pursuant to contingencies are not met  but the probability of an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible  we would disclose the nature of the contingency  if material  and provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss  or state that such an estimate cannot be made 

table of contents significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  any accruals recorded are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we would reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates favorably or unfavorably 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value 
otherwise  the quantitative impairment test is not required 
asu is effective for us beginning in and earlier adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in the financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and credit risk 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk 
to date  substantially all of our international sales have been denominated in us dollars  and therefore  the majority of our revenues are not subject to foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  but historically have had relatively little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
a strengthening of the dollar could make our products and services less competitive in foreign markets and therefore could reduce our revenues 
in the future  an increased portion of our revenues and costs may be denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio  consisting of highly liquid debt instruments of the us government at december   is subject to interest rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio
