item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and uncertainties and elsewhere in this document 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements above 
overview we commenced our exploration stage in january with the change in the management of the company 
from january until march  we were a mineral exploration company 
we advanced our business plan with the acquisition of a drilling services company in  the acquisition of butte highlands in  and the acquisition of staccato gold resources ltd 
in prior to commencing our operations in  the purchase of timberline drilling formerly known as kettle drilling  and a more active and focused exploration division  the company had no reported revenues and accumulated losses 
during we have continued to focus our business model on mineral exploration and development  with future revenues and cash flows  if any  to be derived from any future mineral production 
mineral exploration in  we acquired staccato gold resources ltd 
and its south eureka property in nevada s battle mountain eureka gold trend  which includes the lookout mountain project  and is one of the largest undeveloped exploration properties in nevada  encompassing some square miles 
since our acquisition of the south eureka property we have completed an aggressive work program  including more than  feet of surface drilling  metallurgical testing  geotechnical and geochemical studies  as well as baseline environmental studies 
we have obtained sufficient data to complete several updated mineralization estimates 
in addition  we completed detailed mapping of the geology of the property to better understand the controls of mineralization and to outline additional exploration drill targets that were tested during our most recent drilling program as well as those to be tested in future exploration drilling programs 
given the difficult market conditions for mineral exploration companies  we have scaled back our exploration activities during the past year in order to preserve capital  while still undertaking important permitting and planning activities in order to move projects forward expeditiously as capital becomes available 
at our south eureka property  which includes the lookout mountain project  we followed up on the exploration and drilling programs of the previous three years with continued geochemical waste rock environmental characterization  independent metallurgical leach testing  water quality monitoring and definition of hydrologic work plans 
in addition  we consolidated our elko field office into our eureka facility in order to reduce ongoing expenses 
we also announced an updated gold mineralization estimate in april we expect to proceed with a preliminary economic assessment of the lookout mountain project in  as well as continuing with ongoing metallurgical  geotechnical and environmental studies as part of this assessment 
assuming the availability of funding to undertake our exploration program  we expect that total expenditures on south eureka during fiscal will be approximately million 
these expenditures are discretionary and may be scaled back depending upon the availability of capital to us 
our butte highlands joint venture in montana continued to progress toward commencement of mineral extraction during the fiscal year 
our activities during were concentrated primarily on advancing permitting of the project 
a draft operating permit was received during the year 
in addition  a montana pollutant discharge elimination system mpdes permit application was submitted  and the permit was received  in subsequent to our fiscal year end  but prior to filing this report  we received notification that the mtdeq had completed its draft eis 
receipt of the draft eis is a significant milestone in the process of obtaining the final operating permit to commence mineral extraction 
we expect to obtain all necessary permits to commence mineral extraction in fiscal  including a permit from the united states forest service for ore haulage road use 
surface facilities and infrastructure required for these activities are already in place and were constructed under our exploration permit which has been in place since august timberline s butte highlands joint venture is the first example of our strategy to enter into creative structures that move extractive responsibility to other parties while allowing exposure to gold extraction  where financing has been provided by a third party 
this has been achieved with no dilution to timberline shareholders 
as noted  all expenditures relating to the construction of the projected underground mine are being paid by timberline s joint venture partner  with a total expected construction budget of approximately usd million 
our management and geologists remain committed to providing exploration and potential for discovery to our investors 
looking ahead  it is the opinion of management that our primary commodity focus should be on precious metals primarily gold  and to a lesser extent on silver 
furthermore  we believe that projects similar to lookout mountain and butte highlands are a good fit for the current environment and the unique qualifications of our people and strategic partners 
results of operations for years ended september  and consolidated results us year ended september  consolidated net loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax consolidated net loss our overall consolidated net loss for the year decreased in comparison to the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in mineral exploration expenses by the company  particularly at our south eureka property 
the income from discontinued operations in the previous year includes a  gain on disposal of our former subsidiary  timberline drilling  as well as income from timberline drilling of  during the portion of the fiscal year ended september  prior to its sale 
us year ended september  exploration expenses butte highlands south eureka lookout mountain other exploration properties total exploration expenditures non cash expenses stock option and stock issuance expense depreciation  amortization and accretion total non cash expenses gain on lease of mineral rights salaries and benefits professional fees expense impairment of long term investments impairment of available for sale securities other general and administrative expenses interest expense interest and other income net loss from continuing operations the decrease in the after tax net loss from continuing operations for the year ended september  as compared to the previous year s after tax net loss is a result of considerably decreased expenditures on mineral exploration at our south eureka lookout mountain property and lower expenses 
we did not grant stock options to all employees and directors in fiscal  thereby reducing stock option expense by  from the previous year 
professional fees expenses were higher in than as a result of costs related to our disposition of our former subsidiary  timberline drilling 
other general and administrative expenses were lower in fiscal primarily as a result of reductions in investor relations activities  outside consulting services  travel and office expenses 
during we recognized an increased gain on leases of mineral rights  related to agreements whereby we leased the right to explore our snowstorm prospect and montana copper silver properties as more fully described in item of the annual report  and we had no interest expense  as our outstanding debt obligation was repaid in fiscal the reductions in our net loss from continuing operations in fiscal compared to  described above  were offset in part by the recognition of a  impairment loss on our investment in daycon minerals  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
we also earned less interest income on our note receivable from the purchaser of timberline drilling in fiscal  as the note was repaid midway through the year 
discontinued operations timberline drilling in september  we announced that we had entered into a non binding letter of intent to sell our wholly owned timberline drilling subsidiary 
the results of operations for timberline drilling have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in november  the sale of timberline drilling was completed for a total value of approximately million  including the receipt of million in cash and an additional million in cash from timberline drilling s working capital immediately prior to closing 
the sale of timberline drilling resulted in a gain on disposal of  to the company 
the following table details selected financial information included in the income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended september  and us year ended september  revenues cost of revenues operating expenses interest and other income interest expense net income gain on disposal income from discontinued operations  net of tax our consolidated balance sheet has no assets and liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale at september  or financial condition and liquidity at september   we had assets of  consisting of cash in the amount of  prepaid drilling services of  restricted cash of  property  mineral rights  and equipment  net of depreciation  of  and other assets of  these consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the company is a going concern  which contemplates the realization of our assets and the settlement of our liabilities in the normal course of our operations 
disruptions in the credit and financial markets over the past several years have had a material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
these disruptions  among other things  make it more difficult for us to obtain  or increase our cost of obtaining  capital and financing for our operations 
our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing through equity investments  we will seek multiple solutions including  but not limited to  asset sales  credit facilities or debenture issuances in order to continue as a going concern 
at september  our working capital surplus was  compared to working capital of  at september  as of the date of filing of this report  we have no outstanding debt and a cash balance of approximately  management expects to maintain or increase the amount of working capital and minimize expenditures by minimizing discretionary exploration expenditures  minimizing professional and consulting expenses  and potentially obtaining financing through equity investments  joint ventures  or other types of agreements or strategic arrangements 
we plan  as funding allows  to continue exploration programs on our material exploration properties  to fund some exploratory activities and drilling on early stage properties  and to seek additional acquisition opportunities 
we may not be able to execute our operating plans with our current cash balances 
therefore  we anticipate the need to engage in a financing transaction which may include equity financing  sales of non core assets  credit facilities or debenture issuances  or other strategic arrangements 
with our expected ability to complete such a financing transaction  in addition to our current cash balance  our ability to curtail discretionary exploration expenditures as needed  as well as the expected commencement of cash flows from our butte highlands gold project  we believe that we have sufficient working capital to meet our ongoing non discretionary operating expenses for the next months and maintain our primary mineral properties 
additional financing will be required to allow us to move forward with our exploration program on our lookout mountain project  based on our current plans for that project 
butte highlands continues to be carried to production as defined in the joint venture agreement 
if and when extraction of mineralized material begins as anticipated in  we should realize some income from our share of project cash flows  with potential increased income after initial capital expenditures are repaid and our share of project cash flows increases to 
while this prospective income will serve to fund some of our ongoing exploration expenditures  we do not anticipate that it will initially be sufficient to fund all such activities and that additional financing will still be necessary to fund our other exploration activities  or those activities will have to be curtailed 
given current market conditions  we cannot provide assurance that necessary financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
financing activities in december  we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock to investors in the united states 
we entered into an underwriting agreement to sell  shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of  we incurred  in expenses with respect to the offering  resulting in net proceeds of  in connection with the offering  we also issued  warrants to the underwriter of the public offering 
each warrant is exercisable to acquire one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share for a two year period commencing december  in september  we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock to investors in the united states 
we entered into an underwriting agreement to sell  shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of  we incurred  in expenses with respect to the offering  resulting in net proceeds of  in connection with the offering  we also issued  warrants to the underwriter of the public offering

critical accounting policies and estimates see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for a complete summary of the significant accounting policies used in the presentation of our financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to asset impairments and asset retirement obligations 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows asset impairments significant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties are capitalized 
the evaluation of our mineral properties for impairment is based on market conditions for minerals  underlying mineralized material associated with the properties  and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale 
if no mineable ore body is discovered  or market conditions for minerals deteriorate  there is the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  the manner in which the asset is used  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 
asset retirement obligations we have an obligation to reclaim our properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as a result we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the reclamation costs we expects to incur in association with our south eureka property 
we estimate applicable inflation and credit adjusted risk free rates as well as expected reclamation time frames 
to the extent that the estimated reclamation costs change  such changes will impact future reclamation expense recorded 
a liability is recognized for the present value of estimated environmental remediation asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the offsetting balance is charged to the related long lived asset 
adjustments are made to the liability for changes resulting from passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this standard requires companies to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement  including the income statement line items affected by the reclassification 
the information must be presented in the financial statements in a single note or on the face of the financial statements 
the new accounting guidance also requires the disclosure to be cross referenced to other financial statement disclosures for reclassification items that are not reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period 
the new requirements are effective for public entities in fiscal years including interim periods beginning after december  adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
this standard provides guidance on the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists
