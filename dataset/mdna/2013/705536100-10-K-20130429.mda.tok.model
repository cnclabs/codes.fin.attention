the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k 
highlights highlights of our fiscal year include although our revenues declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  we managed to increase our operating income by from million to million mainly by aligning our costs and expenses to the lower revenue stream 
we have two customers who had exhausted their block licenses and are currently paying us on a pay as you go basis which should temporarily help offset the revenue decline from our other customers 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we account for our software revenues in accordance with provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition and asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements formerly known as statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
over the past several years  we entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with asc and  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between us and the oem selling product utilizing our intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which we are an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable  and collection of the fees are probable 
under our accounting policies  fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period 
if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment 
for fees on multiple element arrangements  values are allocated among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
we generally establish vsoe based upon the price charged when the same elements are sold separately 
when vsoe exists for all undelivered elements  but not for the delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method as prescribed by asc if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements  all revenue for the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such vsoe does exist for the undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  unless the only undelivered element is a service in which revenue from the delivered element is recognized over the service period 
product licensing cost we provide an accrual for estimated product licensing costs owed to third party vendors whose technology is included in the products sold by us 
the accrual is impacted by estimates of the mix of products shipped under certain of our block license agreements 
the estimates are based on historical data and available information as provided by our customers concerning projected shipments 
should actual shipments under these agreements vary from these estimates  adjustments to the estimated accruals for product licensing costs may be required 
such adjustments have historically been within management s expectations 
certain product licensing revenues are dependent  in part  on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from our oem customers 
these reports are provided only on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  we are required to estimate all of the recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter and to further estimate all of our quarterly revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event we are unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting financial results  we may be required to adjust revenues in subsequent periods 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of any customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based primarily on specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of any of our customers  or the economy as a whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
stock based compensation on february  the company adopted fasb asc  compensation stock compensation formerly known as fas r share based payments using the modified prospective transition method 
compensation cost recognized subsequent to adoption includes i compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but unvested as of january   based on the grant date fair value  which is determined using a black scholes option pricing model and ii compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value using a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of share based awards 
we use our actual stock trading history over a five year period as a basis to calculate the expected volatility assumption to value stock options 
the expected dividend yield is based on peerless practice of not paying dividends 
the risk free rate of return is based on the yield of us treasury strips with terms approximating or equal to the expected term of the option 
the expected life in years is based on historical actual stock option exercise experience 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation cost in the period the actual forfeitures occur 
compensation expense for share based awards is recognized using a straight line  or single option method 
we recognize these compensation costs over the service period of the award  which is generally the options vesting term of three to four years 
we recorded approximately  in share based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended january  we granted  options and  shares of restricted common stock during the fiscal year ended january  income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years resulting from differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax provision is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
in february  the company adopted fasb asc  income taxes formerly known as fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas 
see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
asc clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date 
if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained  then no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets can be realized  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
as previously reported in our form q for the quarter ended october   we reversed  of tax liabilities  consisting of  in an unrecognized tax benefit and approximately  in related accrued interest expense 
this reversal of tax liabilities related to an unrecognized tax benefit from the company s tax position taken for the fiscal year ended january   in connection with the completion of the three year statute of limitations period applicable to the corresponding tax return 
as of january   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately  which consisted primarily of the net tax effect on unrealized losses on marketable securities classified in other comprehensive income 
the company utilized all of its federal net operating losses of approximately million to reduce its taxable income  during the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal the company also used the maximum amount of research and development credits of million in the state of california to offset income for the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal substantially all of the company s remaining deferred tax assets were permanently impaired due to a deemed ownership change in connection with the company s self tender offer completed on november  the deemed ownership change occurred pursuant to section of the internal revenue code and resulted in the impairment of approximately million of research and development credits and approximately  in net operating losses in the state of california 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an increase in the valuation allowance of approximately  related to certain deferred tax assets 
results of operations net income net income for the year ended january  was million or per basic and per diluted share  compared to a net income of million  or per basic and per diluted share in fiscal year excluding the effect of the tax liabilities reversal discussed above  net income for the year ended january  was million or per basic and diluted share 
revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily the result of an  block license that was sold during fiscal  while no such block was sold during fiscal the remaining decrease is due to the continued reduction in unit shipments as certain oem devices reached the end of their commercial lives 
these decreases were partially offset by revenue generated by certain customers who are transitioning from a block license or prepay model to a pay as you go model 
cost of revenues product licensing costs were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in product licensing cost in fiscal year was the result of lower product licensing revenues on which we are obligated to pay a third party for licensing their technology as well as the decline in revenue in fiscal year gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the higher gross margin in fiscal was the result of lower fees being paid to third parties due to a change in the product mix generating licensing revenues 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal year were million compared to million for fiscal year the reduction in operating expenses was primarily the result of the company s pursuit to lower costs to align them with an expected decline in revenue  particularly in the areas of compensations and professional service fees 
other income  net other income  net was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  of which million and million respectively were attributable to the net realized gain on marketable securities 
the company classifies the marketable securities as trading or available for sale per asc investments debt equity securities 
interest income earned was  in fiscal year compared to  earned in fiscal year this is attributable to the declining interest rate environment over the past fiscal year 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations total liquidity and capital resources as of january   our principal source of liquidity  cash and cash equivalents  was million  a decrease of million from million at january  the decrease is primarily due to the use of million in cash for the repurchase of our common stock during that time period 
net trade receivables were million at january  and our total assets decreased approximately from million at january  to million at january  primarily due to the decline in market value of our investment in moduslink that amounted to million net of tax effect and the stock buyback of million discussed above 
stockholders equity decreased approximately from million at january  to million at january  this is primarily attributable to stock buyback of million 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was compared to last year 
our operating activities during fiscal used million in cash  compared to million provided by operating activities in fiscal we significantly scaled back our investing activities during the fiscal year ended january  that provided million in cash  compared to our investing activities using million in cash in fiscal our financing activities used million in cash for the buyback of our common stock in fiscal year  compared to providing million from stock option exercises in fiscal item a
