item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations and financial condition as of  and for each of the three years ended  september  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included herein 
non gaap financial measures no non gaap financial measure should be considered as a substitute for any related gaap financial measure 
however  we believe the use of non gaap financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information with which to evaluate its financial performance  or assist in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
we also believe such non gaap financial measures are alternative indicators of performance used by investors  lenders  rating agencies and financial analysts to estimate the value of a publishing business and its ability to meet debt service requirements 
the non gaap financial measures utilized by us are defined as follows adjusted ebitda is defined as operating income loss  plus depreciation  amortization  impairment charges  stock compensation and of ebitda from associated companies  minus equity in earnings of associated companies and curtailment gains 
adjusted income loss and adjusted earnings loss per common share are defined as income loss attributable to lee enterprises  incorporated and earnings loss per common share adjusted to exclude both unusual matters and those of a substantially non recurring nature 
operating cash flow is defined as operating income loss plus depreciation  amortization and impairment charges  minus equity in earnings of associated companies and curtailment gains 
operating cash flow margin is defined as operating cash flow divided by operating revenue 
unlevered free cash flow is defined as operating income loss  plus depreciation  amortization  impairment charges  stock compensation  distributions from associated companies and cash income tax refunds  minus equity in earnings of associated companies  curtailment gains  cash income taxes  pension contributions and capital expenditures 
changes in working capital  asset sales  minority interest and discontinued operations are excluded 
free cash flow also includes financial income  interest expense and debt financing and reorganization costs 
we also present comparable and week results  which are defined as results on a reported basis compared to results on a reported basis excluding the extra week of operations 
the table below reconciles operating cash flow  operating cash flow margin  adjusted ebitda  unlevered free cash flow and free cash flow to operating income loss  the most directly comparable measures under gaap

same property comparisons certain information below  as noted  is presented on a same property basis  which is exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures  if any  consummated in the current or prior year 
we believe such comparisons provide meaningful supplemental information for an understanding of changes in our revenue and operating expenses 
same property comparisons exclude tni and mni 
we own of tni and also own of the capital stock of mni  both of which are reported using the equity method of accounting 
same property comparisons also exclude corporate office costs 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information follows with regard to certain of the most critical of our accounting policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets  we annually assess qualitative factors affecting our business to determine if the probability of a goodwill impairment is more likely than not 
our assessment includes reviewing internal and external factors affecting our business  such as cash flow projections  stock price and other industry or market considerations 
this assessment is normally made in the last fiscal quarter of each year 
we analyze goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
such indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate and operating or cash flow losses related to such assets 
should we determine that a goodwill impairment is more likely than not  we make a determination of the fair value of our business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future revenue  expenses and cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the publishing industry 
a non cash impairment charge will generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the business exceeds its estimated fair value 
we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group with their carrying amount 
the impairment amount  if any  is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
should we determine that a nonamortized intangible asset impairment is more likely than not  we make a determination of the individual asset fair value 
fair value is determined using the relief from royalty method  which estimates fair value based upon appropriate royalties of future revenue discounted to their present value 
the impairment amount  if any  is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of such asset 
the required valuation methodology and underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by us and represent a level fair value measurement 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
due primarily to our stockholders deficit in and to the difference between our stock price and the per share carrying value of our net assets in  we analyzed the carrying value of our net assets in and continued deterioration in our revenue and the weak economic environment were also factors in the timing of the analyses 
in  we concluded the fair value of our business was in excess of the carrying value of our net assets 
as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded 
however  we determined that the cash flows from nonamortized and amortizable intangible assets were not sufficient to recover their carrying values 
as a result  we recorded non cash charges to reduce the carrying values of such assets 
in  we concluded the fair value of our business did not exceed the carrying value of our net assets 
as a result  we recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying values of goodwill  nonamortized and amortizable intangible assets 
additional pretax  non cash charges were recorded to reduce the carrying value of tni 
we also recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment in  and we recorded deferred income tax benefits related to these charges 
a summary of impairment charges is included in the table below thousands of dollars continuing operations goodwill nonamortized intangible assets amortizable intangible assets property and equipment reduction in investment in tni discontinued operations we also periodically evaluate our determination of the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets 
any resulting changes in the useful lives of such intangible assets will not impact our cash flows 
however  a decrease in the useful lives of such intangible assets would increase future amortization expense and decrease future reported operating results and earnings per common share 
future decreases in our market value  or significant differences in revenue  expenses or cash flows from estimates used to determine fair value  could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans we evaluate our liability for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based upon computations made by consulting actuaries  incorporating estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs  future interest costs on projected benefit obligations  rates of compensation increases  when applicable  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  expected investment returns on plan assets  asset allocation assumptions of plan assets  and other factors 
if we used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly  resulting in recognition of different amounts of expense over future periods 
increases in market interest rates  which may impact plan assumptions  generally result in lower service costs for current employees  higher interest expense and lower liabilities 
actual returns on plan assets that are lower than the plan assumptions will generally result in decreases in a plan funded status and may necessitate additional contributions 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method  whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
changes in accounting for uncertain tax positions can result in additional variability in our effective income tax rate 
we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
we file income tax returns with the internal revenue service irs and various state tax jurisdictions 
from time to time  we are subject to routine audits by those agencies  and those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
we have considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing agencies  believe our positions taken regarding our filings are valid  and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters 
however  the actual outcome cannot be determined with certainty and the difference could be material  either positively or negatively  to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in the periods in which such matters are ultimately determined 
we do not believe the final resolution of such matters will be material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows 
revenue recognition advertising revenue is recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication or on the related digital product 
subscription revenue is recorded over the print or digital product subscription term or as such newspapers are individually sold 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for print or digital products or advance payments for advertising 
uninsured risks we are self insured for health care  workers compensation and certain long term disability costs of our employees  subject to stop loss insurance  which limits exposure to large claims 
we accrue our estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred  including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
other risks are insured and carry deductible losses of varying amounts 
our accrued reserves for health care and workers compensation claims are based upon estimates of the remaining liability for retained losses made by consulting actuaries 
the amount of workers compensation reserve has been determined based upon historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry 
an increasing frequency of large claims  deterioration in overall claim experience or changes in federal or state laws affecting our liability for such claims could increase the volatility of expenses for such self insured risks 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard  which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on indefinite lived intangible assets is necessary 
specifically  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   and early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this amendment in did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in  the fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard  which requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
this guidance does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements and is effective beginning in we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

year over year total digital advertising has been rising steadily since december print advertising and marketing services revenue on a stand alone basis decreased in subscription and other revenue excluding the extra week of operations in  subscription revenue increased compared to the prior year and increased  or  compared to on a reported basis 
the increases are primarily due to price increases and increases in digital subscribers  which were partially offset by decreases in print subscribers

operating cash flow margin increased to in from in  reflecting a larger percentage decrease in operating expenses than the decrease in operating revenue 
depreciation expense decreased  or  in and amortization expense decreased  or  in due to full amortization of certain assets in prior years and impairment charges in the current year 
due primarily to the company stockholders deficit  we analyzed the carrying value of our net assets in continued deterioration in our revenue and the weak economic environment were also factors in the timing of the analysis 
we concluded the fair value of goodwill was in excess of its carrying value 
as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded 
however  we determined that the cash flows from certain amortizable intangible assets were not sufficient to recover their carrying values 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge to reduce their carrying values to fair value 
we also recorded non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment in and we recorded deferred income tax benefits related to these charges 
a summary of impairment charges is included in the table below thousands of dollars continuing operations nonamortized intangible assets amortizable intangible assets property and equipment discontinued operations the patient protection and affordable care act  along with its companion reconciliation legislation together the affordable care act  were enacted into law in the affordable care act will be supported by a substantial number of underlying regulations  some of which have not been issued 
more recently  certain provisions applicable to employers were delayed 
accordingly  a complete determination of the impact of the affordable care act cannot be made at this time 
however  we expect our future health care costs to increase more rapidly based on analysis published by the united states department of health and human services  input from independent advisors and our understanding of various provisions of the affordable care act that differ from our current medical plans 
we may be able to mitigate certain of these future cost increases through changes in plan design 
we do not expect the affordable care act will have a significant impact on our postretirement medical benefit obligation liability 
equity in earnings in associated companies increased  in the factors noted above resulted in an operating loss of  in  on a reported basis  compared to operating income of  in nonoperating income and expense interest expense increased  or  to  in due primarily to higher interest rates on our debt since the january refinancing  which were partially offset by lower debt balances and refinancing of the pulitzer notes

interest expense includes  and  of non cash amortization of a present value adjustment of debt in and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense from the refinancing of our debt in january cycled in january absent a significant increase in libor  we expect interest expense to continue to decline due to lower debt balances  which decreased  in  and the lower interest rate on the new pulitzer notes

the plan requires us to suspend stockholder dividends and share repurchases through december as discussed more fully in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein  in january  in conjunction with the effectiveness of the plan  we refinanced all of our debt 
the plan refinanced our then existing credit agreement and extended the april maturity in a structure of first and second lien debt with the existing lenders lenders 
we also amended the pulitzer notes  and extended the april maturity with the existing noteholders 
in may  we again refinanced the remaining balance of the pulitzer notes 
debt is summarized as follows interest rates thousands of dollars september september september revolving credit facility st lien agreement nd lien agreement new pulitzer notes pulitzer notes unamortized present value adjustment less current maturities of long term debt current amount of present value adjustment total long term debt at september   our weighted average cost of debt was 
aggregate maturities of debt total  in   in   in and  in liquidity at september   after consideration of letters of credit  we have approximately  available for future use under our revolving credit facility 
including cash  our liquidity at september  totals  this liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows 
our unlevered free cash flow has been stable for the last five years and has exceeded  in each year from through we expect all interest and principal payments due in the next twelve months will be satisfied by our continuing cash flows  which will allow us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity 
at september   the principal amount of our outstanding debt totals  achieving the amount projected for september under the plan two years early 
lower cash balances and asset sales have contributed to the improvement in debt repayment compared to the plan 
at september   the principal amount of our debt  net of cash  is times our adjusted ebitda  compared to a ratio of at september  we expect to refinance amounts outstanding under our debt agreements on or before their respective maturity dates with other loans  debt securities or equity securities  in privately negotiated transactions including exchanges  or public offerings 
the timing of such refinancing will depend on many factors  including market conditions  our liquidity requirements  our debt maturity profile  and contractual restrictions 
we continuously monitor the credit and equity markets for refinancing opportunities  and have ongoing relationships with experts in debt and equity financing to assist us 
there are numerous potential consequences under the st lien agreement  nd lien agreement  and the new pulitzer notes  if an event of default  as defined  occurs and is not remedied 
many of those consequences are beyond our control 
the occurrence of one or more events of default would give rise to the right of the st lien lenders  nd lien lenders and or berkshire  to exercise their remedies under the st lien agreement  nd lien agreement  and the new pulitzer notes  respectively  including  without limitation  the right to accelerate all outstanding debt and take actions authorized in such circumstances under applicable collateral security documents 
our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and to refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due  or earlier if available liquidity is consumed 
we are in compliance with our debt covenants at september  other matters cash and cash equivalents increased  in and  in and decreased  in seasonality our largest source of publishing revenue  retail advertising  is seasonal and tends to fluctuate with retail sales in markets served 
historically  retail advertising is higher in the december and june quarters 
advertising and marketing services revenue is lowest in the march quarter 
quarterly results of operations are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein 
inflation price increases or decreases for our products are implemented when deemed appropriate by us 
we continuously evaluate price increases  productivity improvements  sourcing efficiencies and other cost reductions to mitigate the impact of inflation 
changes in laws and regulations energy costs energy costs have become more volatile  and may increase in the future as a result of carbon emissions and other regulations being developed by the united states environmental protection agency 
health care costs the affordable care act was enacted into law in as a result  in we wrote off  of deferred income tax assets due to the loss of future tax deductions for providing retiree prescription drug benefits 
we expect the affordable care act will be supported by a substantial number of underlying regulations  many of which have not been issued 
more recently  certain provisions applicable to employers were delayed 
accordingly  a complete determination of the impact of the affordable care act cannot be made at this time 
however  we expect our future health care costs to increase more rapidly based on analysis published by the united states department of health and human services  input from independent advisors and our understanding of various provisions of the affordable care act that differ from our previous medical plans  such as certain preventive services provided without charge to employees  automatic enrollment of new employees  higher maximum age for dependent coverage  elimination of lifetime benefit caps  and free choice vouchers for certain lower income employees 
administrative costs are also likely to increase as a result of new compliance reporting and mandatory fees per participant 
new costs being imposed on other medical care businesses  such as health insurers  pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers  may be passed on to us in the form of higher costs 
we may be able to mitigate certain of these future cost increases through changes in plan design 
we do not expect the affordable care act will have a significant impact on our postretirement medical benefit obligation liability 
pension plans in  the surface transportation extension act of stea was signed into law 
stea provides for changes in the determination of discount rates that result in a near term reduction in minimum funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans 
stea will also result in an increase in future premiums to be paid to the pension benefit guarantee corporation 
income taxes certain states in which we operate are considering changes to their corporate income tax rates 
until such changes are enacted  the impact of such changes cannot be determined 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at september  thousands of dollars payments or commitments due years nature of obligation total less than more than debt principal amount interest expense operating lease obligations capital expenditure commitments maturities of long term debt are limited to mandatory payments and  accordingly  exclude excess cash flow  asset sale and other payments required under the st lien agreement and the new pulitzer notes as such amounts cannot be determined

interest expense under the st lien agreement is estimated based on the day minimum libor level of as increased by our applicable margin of applied to the outstanding balance  as reduced by future contractual maturities of such debt 
interest expense under the nd lien agreement is estimated using the contractual rate applied to the outstanding balance during each period 
interest expense under the new pulitzer notes is estimated using the contractual rate applied to the outstanding balance as reduced by future contractual maturities of such debt 
changes in interest rates in excess of the minimum libor level  use of borrowing rates not based on libor  use of interest rate hedging instruments  and or principal payments in excess of contractual maturities or based on other requirements of the st lien agreement  nd lien agreement or new pulitzer notes could significantly change this estimate

commitments exclude unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in accordance with financial accounting standards board asc topic  income taxes 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities for such matters 
a substantial amount of our deferred income tax liabilities is related to acquisitions and will not result in future cash payments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below 
interest rates on debt our debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
our primary exposure is to libor 
a basis point increase or decrease to libor would  if in excess of libor minimums discussed more fully below  decrease or increase  respectively  income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately  based on  of floating rate debt outstanding at september  our debt under the st lien agreement is subject to minimum interest rate levels of 
based on the difference between interest rates in december and our minimum rate  libor would need to increase approximately basis points for six month borrowing up to approximately basis points for one month borrowing before our borrowing cost would begin to be impacted by an increase in interest rates 
at september   approximately of the principal amount of our debt is subject to floating interest rates 
we regularly evaluate alternatives to hedge the related interest rate risk 
commodities certain materials used by us are exposed to commodity price changes 
we manage this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
we participate in a buying cooperative with other publishing companies  primarily for the acquisition of newsprint 
we are also involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and operating efficiencies 
primary commodity price exposures are newsprint and  to a lesser extent  ink and energy costs 
production capacity reductions by north american newsprint producers have not kept pace with declines in demand from domestic publishing and commercial print consumers 
export markets have partially offset this demand reduction but have not been able to totally replace the north american decline 
eastern us newsprint prices declined in while western us pricing first declined and then recovered to eastern us prices 
a slightly weakened canadian dollar  as compared to the us dollar  has helped mitigate cost increase pressures on canadian producers 
future price changes  if any  will be influenced primarily by the balance between supply capacity and demand  domestic and export  in addition to the producers ability to mitigate input cost pressures and the us to canadian exchange rate 
the final extent of future price change announcements  if any  is subject to negotiations with each newsprint producer 
a per tonne price increase for pound newsprint would result in an annualized reduction in income before income taxes of approximately  based on anticipated consumption in  excluding consumption of tni and mni and the impact of lifo accounting 
such prices may also decrease 
we manage significant newsprint inventories  which may help to mitigate the impact of future price increases 
sensitivity to changes in value our fixed rate debt consists of the nd lien agreement which is not traded on an active market and is held by a small group of investors  and the new pulitzer notes 
we are unable  as of september   to measure the maximum potential impact on fair value of fixed rate debt from adverse changes in market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the change in value  if determined  could be significant
