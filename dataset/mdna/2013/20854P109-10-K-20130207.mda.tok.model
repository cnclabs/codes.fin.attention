item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k for a breakdown by segment 
for the year ended december  average gas sales price before effects of financial settlements per thousand cubic feet average effects of financial settlements per thousand cubic feet average gas sales price including effects of financial settlements per thousand cubic feet average lifting costs excluding ad valorem and severance taxes per thousand cubic feet we enter into physical gas sales transactions with various counterparties for terms varying in length 
reserves and production estimates are believed to be sufficient to satisfy these obligations 
in the past  other than interstate pipeline outages related to maintenance issues or a weather related force majeure event  we have not failed to deliver quantities required under contract 
we also enter into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges 
these gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions and represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these gas swap represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
as of january   we expect these transactions will cover approximately billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet  billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet  and billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
we have purchased firm transportation capacity on various interstate pipelines to ensure gas production flows to market 
as of december   we have secured firm transportation capacity to cover more than our  and hedged production 
the hedging strategy and information regarding derivative instruments used are outlined in part ii item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk and in note derivative instruments in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k midstream gas services consol energy has traditionally designed  built and operated natural gas gathering systems to move gas from the wellhead to interstate pipelines or other local sales points 
in addition  consol energy acquired extensive gathering assets in the dominion acquisition in consol energy now owns or operates approximately  miles of gas gathering pipelines as well as  horsepower of compression  of which  approximately is wholly owned with the balance being leased 
along with this compression capacity  consol energy owns and operates a number of gas processing facilities 
this infrastructure is capable of delivering billion cubic feet per year of pipeline quality gas 
on september   in connection with the noble energy joint venture for marcellus shale wells and leaseholdings  cone gathering  llc was formed cone or cone gathering 
consol energy and noble energy each own of cone gathering 
cone gathering was formed to develop  operate and own both noble energy and consol energy marcellus shale gathering system needs 
consol energy operates this equity affiliate 
upon formation of cone gathering  consol energy contributed its then existing marcellus shale gathering assets to cone gathering 
we believe that the network of right of ways  vast surface holdings and experience in building and operating gathering systems in the appalachian basin will give cone gathering an advantage in building the midstream assets required to develop the joint venture marcellus shale position 
consol energy has had the advantage of having gas production from cbm  which can be lower btu than pipeline specification  as well as higher btu marcellus shale production which can complement each other by reducing and in some cases eliminating the need for the costly processing of cbm 
in addition  the lower btu cbm production offers an opportunity to blend ethane back into the gas stream when pricing or capacity for ethane markets dictate 
this will allow consol energy more flexibility in bringing marcellus shale wells on line at qualities that meet interstate pipeline specifications 
other operations consol energy provides other services both to our own operations and to others 
these include land services  industrial supply services  terminal services  river and dock services and water services 
non core mineral assets and surface properties consol energy owns significant coal and gas assets that are not in our short or medium term development plans 
we continually explore the monetization of these non core assets by means of sale  lease  contribution to joint ventures  or a combination of the foregoing in order to bring the value of these assets forward for the benefit of our shareholders 
we also control a significant amount of surface acreage 
this surface acreage is valuable to us in the development of the gathering system for our marcellus shale and utica shale production 
we also derive value from this surface control by granting rights of way or development rights to third parties when we are able to derive appropriate value for our shareholders

cnx water also has contracts to provide water to third parties for industrial use from various water sources owned by consol energy 
in june  consol energy announced that it acquired a non controlling interest in epiphany solar water systems  a privately held company founded in new castle  pa in epiphany solar water systems is testing what is believed to be the world first concentrated solar powered water purification system 
under the agreement  consol energy has made an initial investment of million and one of its marcellus shale gas well locations in greene county served as the site to pilot test this solar powered water purification system 
initial testing of the epiphany unit demonstrated the efficacy of the approach 
based on results of the pilot test  system improvements and upgrades are being implemented 
testing is ongoing and will be used to evaluate system enhancements in the coming months 
employee and labor relations at december   consol energy had  employees  approximately of whom were represented by the united mine workers of america umwa 
in  the bituminous coal operators association bcoa and the united mine workers of america umwa reached a collective bargaining agreement which runs from july  to december  the national bituminous coal wage agreement of nbcwa covers approximately  employees of consol energy subsidiaries 
key elements of the agreement include the following items a 
a wage increase of per hour effective july   and an additional per hour increase each january st throughout the contract term 
b 
contributions to the pension plan  a multi employer plan  will continue at the current rate of per hour throughout the contract term 
new inexperienced miners hired after december  do not participate in the pension plan  but receive a per hour contribution increasing to per hour in to the umwa cash deferred savings plan cdsp  which is a k plan 
umwa represented employees with over years of credited service under the pension plan receive a per hour contribution increasing to per hour in to the cdsp beginning january  also beginning january   umwa represented employees have the right to elect to opt out of future participation in the pension plan and upon such election  receive a per hour contribution increasing to per hour in to the cdsp 
c 
a per hour contribution starting january  to a new defined contribution plan to provide retiree bonus payments to eligible retirees in  and d 
an increased contribution from per hour to per hour effective january  to the benefit plan  which is a defined contribution plan providing health benefits to certain retirees 
e 
various other changes related to absenteeism  contributions to various umwa benefit funds  and eligibility for various vacation days and sick days 
laws and regulations the mining and gas industries are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities on matters such as the discharge of materials into the environment  permitting and other licensing requirements  reclamation and restoration of properties after mining or gas operations are completed  management of materials generated by mining and gas operations  pipeline compression and transmission of natural gas and liquids  surface subsidence from underground mining  water discharge effluent limits  water appropriation  air quality standards  protection of wetlands  endangered plant and wildlife protection  limitations on land use  storage of petroleum products and substances that are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws  management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  legislatively mandated benefits for current and retired coal miners  and employee health and safety 
in addition  the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities  which could affect demand for consol energy coal and gas products 
the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on consol energy mining or gas operations or our customers ability to use coal or gas and may require consol energy or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs 
numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining and gas operations 
regulations provide that a mining permit or modification can be delayed  refused or revoked if an officer  director or a stockholder with a or greater interest in the entity is affiliated with or is in a position to control another entity that has outstanding permit violations 
thus  all mining operations of consol energy entities must be maintained in compliance to avoid delay in issuance of necessary mining permits 
consol energy is  or may be  required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data and or analysis pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal or gas may have upon the environment  the public and employee health and safety 
permits we need may include requirements that may be subject to future restrictive standards or interpreted in a manner which restricts our ability to conduct our mining and gas operations or to do so profitably 
future legislation and administrative regulations may increasingly emphasize the protection of the environment and employee health and safety 
as a consequence  the activities of consol energy may be more closely regulated 
such legislation and regulations  as well as future interpretations of existing laws  may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to consol energy and delays  interruptions or a termination of operations  the extent of which cannot be predicted 
compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of mining and gas production for all domestic coal and gas producers 
we post surety performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing  often including the cost of treating mine water discharge 
we also post performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to state oil and gas laws and regulations to guarantee reclamation of gas well sites and plugging of gas wells 
we endeavor to conduct our mining and gas operations in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations 
however  because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements against a backdrop of variable geologic and seasonal conditions  permit exceedances and violations during mining and gas production can and do occur 
consol energy made capital expenditures for environmental control facilities of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in accordance with a consent decree with the us environmental protection agency and the west virginia environmental protection agency  consol energy began construction of an advance water processing system in northern west virginia in construction is expected to be complete in expenditures related to the northern west virginia plant of million and million were incurred in and  respectively  and total costs related to the construction of this plant and related facilities is expected to be approximately million 
consol energy expects to have capital expenditures of million in for environmental control facilities 
mine health and safety laws legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment  construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas  and engage in additional training 
we have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols and with new regulations the amount of civil penalties have increased 
the actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring the caching of additional supplies of self contained self rescuer scsr devices underground  the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground  the placement of refuge chambers  which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible  which will provide breathable air for hours  the replacement of existing seals in worked out areas of mines with stronger seals  the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground  additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees  and more stringent rock dusting requirements 
in december  the department of labor released its regulatory agenda for the msha of final and proposed rules 
final rules included proximity detection on continuous mining machines and lowering miners coal dust exposure and the use of personal dust monitors 
proposed rules included reducing the silica standard and included proximity detection on mobile equipment 
occupational safety and health act our gas operations are subject to regulation under the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws in some states  all of which regulate health and safety of employees at our gas operations 
also  osha hazardous communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by our gas operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local governments and the public 
black lung legislation under federal black lung benefits legislation  each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease  certain survivors of a miner who dies from black lung disease or pneumoconiosis  and a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before january   where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims where a miner last coal employment was after december   or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment of such benefits 
the trust fund is funded by an excise tax on us production of up to per ton for deep mined coal and up to per ton for surface mined coal  neither amount to exceed of the gross sales price 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca made two changes to the federal black lung benefits act 
first  it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least years in underground coal mines  or in similar conditions  and suffer from a totally disabling lung disease 
to rebut this presumption  a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner work 
second  it changed the law so black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away  regardless of the cause of the miner death 
in addition to the federal legislation  we are also liable under various state statutes for black lung claims 
retiree health benefits legislation the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the act established the combined benefit fund the combined fund 
the combined fund provides medical and death benefits for all beneficiaries including orphan retirees of the former united mine workers of america umwa benefit trusts who were actually receiving benefits as of july  the act also created a second benefit fund for umwa retirees  the benefit plan 
the benefit plan principally provides medical and death benefits to orphan umwa represented members eligible for retirement on february   and who actually retired between july  and september  the act provides for the assignment of beneficiaries to former signatory employers or related companies and the allocation of responsibility for unassigned beneficiaries referred to as orphans to the assigned operators 
the task of calculating the annual per beneficiary premium that assigned operators are obligated to pay to the combined fund is the responsibility of the commissioner of social security 
the umwa benefit plan is a defined contribution plan that was created as the result of negotiations for the national bituminous coal wage agreement nbcwa of this plan provides health care benefits to orphan umwa retirees who are not eligible to participate in the combined fund  the benefit fund  or whose last employer signed the nbcwa or a later nbcwa  and subsequently goes out of business 
the act requires some of our signatory subsidiaries to make premium payments to the combined fund and to the benefit plan for the cost of our retirees and orphan retirees in those plans 
in addition  the nbcwa of requires our signatory subsidiaries to make specified payments to the benefit plan through the tax relief and health care act of the act provides additional federal funding for these orphan costs by authorizing general fund revenues and transfers of interest from the abandoned mine land aml trust fund 
the additional federal funding  depending upon its magnitude and the amount of orphan benefits payable  should cover the orphan premium payments due under the combined fund as well as the orphan premium payments due under the benefit plan 
federal contributions were in and are expected to continue to be in and beyond 
in addition  federal contributions cover the costs for those orphan retirees as of december  under the benefit plan 
under the act  these general fund contributions to the combined fund  the benefit plan and the benefit plan and certain aml payments to the states and indian tribes are collectively limited by an aggregate annual cap of million 
these federal contributions do not apply to our subsidiaries assigned retired miners  and therefore our subsidiaries will continue to make premium payments for our assigned retired miners who receive benefits from the combined fund  the benefit plan and for certain beneficiaries of the benefit plan 
in addition  our subsidiaries remain responsible for making orphan premium payments to the combined fund and benefit plan to the extent that the federal contributions are not sufficient to cover the benefits 
pension protection act the pension protection act of the pension act simplified and transformed rules governing the funding of defined benefit plans  accelerated funding obligations of employers  made permanent certain provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of egtrra  made permanent the diversification rights and investment education provisions for plan participants and encourages automatic enrollment in defined contribution k plans 
in general  most provisions of the pension act of were effective for plan years beginning on or after december  plans generally are required to set a funding target of of the present value of accrued benefits and sponsors are required to amortize unfunded liabilities over a seven year period 
the pension act includes a funding target of after plans with a funded ratio of less than  or less than using special assumptions  will be deemed to be at risk and will be subject to additional funding requirements 
the plan year funding ratio of consol energy salary retirement plan was 
the funding ratio is subject to year over year volatility and internal revenue service calculation guidelines 
environmental laws consol energy is subject to various federal environmental laws  including the surface mining control and reclamation act of  the clean air act  the clean water act  the endangered species act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the toxic substances control act  and the emergency planning and community right to know act  as administered and enforced by the united states environmental protection agency epa and or authorized federal or state agencies  as well as state laws of similar scope  and other state environmental and conservation laws in each state in which consol energy operates 
these environmental laws require reporting  permitting and or approval of many aspects of coal mining and gas operations 
both federal and state inspectors regularly visit mines and other facilities to ensure compliance 
consol energy has an iso compliant environmental management system designed to ensure compliance with such environmental laws and regulations 
given the retroactive nature of certain environmental laws  consol energy has incurred  and may in the future incur liabilities in connection with properties and facilities currently or previously owned or operated 
these liabilities may be increased to include sites to which consol energy or our subsidiaries sent waste materials 
surface mining control and reclamation act the federal surface mining control and reclamation act smcra establishes minimum national operational  reclamation and closure standards for all surface mines as well as most aspects of deep mines 
smcra requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities 
permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the office of surface mining osm or  where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under smcra  the appropriate state regulatory authority 
states that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards which are more stringent than the requirements of smcra and osm regulations and in many instances have done so 
all states in which consol energy active mining operations are located have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of smcra through approved state programs 
smcra permit provisions include requirements for coal exploration  baseline environmental data collection and analysis  mine plan development  topsoil removal  storage and replacement  selective handling of overburden materials  mine pit backfilling and grading  protection of the hydrologic balance  subsidence control for underground mines  refuse disposal plans  surface drainage control  mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment  and site reclamation 
all states also impose an obligation on surface mining operations to restore or replace domestic  agricultural or industrial water supplies and on underground mine operations to restore or replace drinking  domestic or residential water supplies adversely affected by such operations 
in addition  smcra imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations  the proceeds of which are deposited in the abandoned mine reclamation fund aml fund  which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before the current per ton fee is per ton for surface mined coal and per ton for underground mined coal 
from october  through september   the fees will be per ton for surface mined coal and per ton for underground mined coal 
osm is currently considering modifications to the existing stream buffer zone regulation  which amendments are referred to as the stream protection rule 
an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking anpr was published in november based on the anpr  the proposed rule would apply to surface mining as well as underground mining activities that may impact streams 
although it is too early to predict what the impacts of the proposed amendments will be  all of the alternatives identified in the anpr could result in loss of access to significant amounts of coal and or significant increases in reclamation costs 
in pennsylvania  where consol energy operates two longwall mines  approximately million  million and million of expenses were incurred during the years ended december   and  respectively  to mitigate and repair impacts on streams from subsidence 
with respect to subsidence impacts to streams  the regulatory requirement to minimize impacts to the hydrological balance could cause consol energy to change mine plans  to incur significant costs  and potentially even shut down mines in order to meet compliance requirements 
we currently estimate expenses related to subsidence of streams in pennsylvania will be approximately million for the year ended december  clean air act and related regulations the federal clean air act and similar state laws and regulations which regulate emissions into the air  affect coal mining  coal handling and processing  and gas production and processing operations primarily through permitting and or emissions control requirements 
the clean air act also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of the coal fired electric power generating plants operated by our customers 
coal contains impurities  such as sulfur  mercury and other constituents  many of which are released into the air when coal is burned 
carbon dioxide  a greenhouse gas  is also emitted when coal is burned 
environmental regulations governing emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could affect demand for coal as a fuel source and affect the volume of our sales 
in  the epa promulgated or finalized several rulemakings impacting coal generating facilities 
two of these were final rules for new source performance standards for coal and oil fueled power plants in the utility maximum control technology umact rule which includes more stringent new source performance standards nsps for particulate matter pm  so and so and the mercury and air toxics standards mats rule which sets new mercury and air toxic standards 
in november  epa published a notice of reconsideration of certain aspects of the umact and mats rules 
epa proposes to raise the emission limits for mercury  hydrogen chloride and particulate matter in line with the reconsideration petitions of what has been deemed achievable by emissions control manufacturers 
in addition  in august  the us court of appeals in washington  dc invalidated epa cross state air pollution rule which was intended to regulate sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen dioxide nox and fine particulate matter 
the court ruled that the agency had overstepped its bounds and vacated the rulemaking  ordering the agency to continue to enforce the clean air interstate rule promulgated in until a viable replacement to the cross state regulation could be issued 
on october   epa filed a petition for an en banc review of the august decision with the us court of appeals in washington  dc 
the decision on the en banc review is currently pending 
on march   the us environmental protection agency epa proposed standards for the emission of greenhouse gases ghg from new and reconstructed electric generating units at power plants 
such regulations could significantly increase the cost of generation of electricity at coal fired facilities and could make competing forms of electricity generation more competitive 
the clean air act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from compressor stations and other equipment and facilities used in our gas operations 
we are required to obtain pre approval for construction or modification of certain facilities  to meet stringent air permit requirements  or to use specific equipment  technologies or best management practices to control emissions 
on august   the epa published final revisions to the new source performance standards nsps to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds vocs and sulfur dioxide so from various oil and gas exploration  production  processing and transportation facilities and to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to further regulate emissions from the oil and natural gas production sector and the transmission and storage of natural gas 
in september  the epa finalized the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas rule 
the current version of this rule requires annual reporting of emissions from coal mines  gas wells and associated facilities 
clean water act the federal clean water act cwa and corresponding state laws affect coal and gas operations by regulating discharges into surface waters 
permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters 
the clean water act and corresponding state laws include requirements for improvement of designated impaired waters not meeting state water quality standards through the use of effluent limitations  anti degradation regulations which protect state designated high quality exceptional use streams by restricting or prohibiting discharges  requirements to treat discharges from coal mining properties for non traditional pollutants  such as chlorides  selenium and dissolved solids  for minimizing impacts and compensating for unavoidable impacts resulting from discharges of fill materials to regulated streams and wetlands  and the requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities 
in addition  the spill prevention  control and countermeasure spcc requirements of the cwa apply to all consol energy operations that use or produce fluids  including brine and oil  and require that plans be in place to address any spills and that secondary containment be installed around all tanks 
these requirements may cause consol energy to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
in order to obtain a permit for surface coal mining activities  including valley fills associated with steep slope mining  an operator must obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the army corps of engineers the coe pursuant to section of the clean water act and must obtain a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to section of the clean water act authorizing the issuance of national pollutant discharge elimination permits or npdes permits 
beginning in early  the epa took a number of initiatives that have resulted in delays and obstruction of the issuance of such permits for surface mining operation in the states of kentucky  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia and west virginia designated as appalachian surface coal mining 
increased oversight of delegated state programmatic authority  coupled with individual permit review and additional requirements imposed by the epa  has resulted in delays in the review and issuance of permits for surface coal mining operations  including applications for surface facilities for underground mines  such as applications for coal refuse disposal areas 
on july  the us district court for the district of columbia set aside epa guidance issued in april designed to address water quality for coal mines in appalachia 
thus far  consol energy subsidiaries have been able to continue operating their existing mines 
however  consol energy was affected by a delay in permitting in for a new coal mine in mingo county  wv  which resulted in a worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn notice being issued for employees scheduled to begin work on the new mine 
since  consol energy has undertaken permitting activities to permit a new surface mine with a post mine land use plan for a five mile stretch of connecting highway that is part of the king coal highway corridor 
consol of kentucky entered into a memorandum of understanding in conjunction with the federal department of highways administration and the us army corps of engineers  to coordinate the design of the valley fills to serve as highway infrastructure 
however  the epa objected to consol energy water discharge permit on the grounds of their april appalachian guidance  which resulted in consol energy issuance of a warn notice on october  for employees who were planned to work at the new coal mine 
consol energy was able  in this instance  to redeploy these employees to work at another adjacent coal mine property for which a permit was already issued 
however  there is no assurance that the permit for a new coal mine will be issued  or that consol energy would be able to re deploy its employees under future similar circumstances 
pursuant to a congressional requirement in the epa budget appropriation  the epa must conduct a comprehensive study of the potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
hydraulic fracturing is a way of producing gas from tight rock formations such as the barnett and marcellus shales 
the epa initiated the study in early january with a final report to be published in the epa has also announced plans to conduct a review of water produced in conjunction with the production of coal bed methane cbm to determine whether its disposal should be further regulated 
endangered species act the federal endangered species act esa and similar state laws protect species threatened with extinction 
protection of endangered and threatened species may cause us to modify mining plans  gas well pad siting or pipeline right of ways  or develop and implement species specific protection and enhancement plans to avoid or minimize impacts to endangered species or their habitats 
a number of species indigenous to the areas where we operate are protected under the esa 
based on the species that have been identified and the current application of applicable laws and regulations  we do not believe that there are any species protected under the esa or state laws that would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal or produce gas from our properties 
comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and similar state laws create liabilities for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
we could incur liability under cercla relative to our coal or gas operations 
our current and former coal mining operations incur  and will continue to incur  expenditures associated with the investigation and remediation of facilities and environmental conditions  including underground storage tanks  solid and hazardous waste disposal and other matters under superfund and similar state environmental laws 
we also must comply with reporting requirements under the emergency planning and community right to know act and the toxic substances control act 
from time to time  we have been the subject of administrative proceedings  litigation and investigations relating to sites that have released hazardous substances 
we have been in the past and currently are named as a potentially responsible party at superfund sites 
we may become involved in future proceedings  litigation or investigations and incur liabilities that could be materially adverse to us 
resource conservation and recovery act the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining and gas operations by imposing requirements for the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes 
facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated  stored or disposed are subject to corrective action orders issued by the epa which could adversely affect our results  financial condition and cash flows 
in  the epa proposed options for the regulation of coal combustion residuals from the electric power sector 
a final decision has not yet been issued 
depending on the outcome of that decision  demand for coal fired electricity generation could be adversely impacted 
federal regulation of the sale and transportation of gas various aspects of our gas operations are regulated by agencies of the federal government 
the federal energy regulatory commission regulates the transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of in  congress enacted the natural gas wellhead decontrol act  which removed all natural gas act and natural gas policy act price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  while first sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of condensate and natural gas liquids can be made currently at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
regulations and orders set forth by the federal energy regulatory commission also impact our gas business to a certain degree 
although the federal energy regulatory commission does not directly regulate our gas production activities  the federal energy regulatory commission has stated that it intends for certain of its orders to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
additionally  the federal energy regulatory commission continues to review its transportation regulations  including whether to allocate all short term capacity on the basis of competitive auctions and whether changes to its long term transportation policies may also be appropriate to avoid a market bias toward short term contracts 
additional federal energy regulatory commission orders have been adopted based on this review with the goal of increasing competition for natural gas markets and transportation 
the federal energy regulatory commission has also issued numerous orders confirming the sale and abandonment of natural gas gathering facilities previously owned by interstate pipelines and acknowledging that if the federal energy regulatory commission does not have jurisdiction over services provided by these facilities  then such facilities and services may be subject to regulation by state authorities in accordance with state law 
changes in regulations or policy underlying federal natural gas pipeline safety requirements could also impact services and costs 
in addition  the federal energy regulatory commission approval of transfers of previously regulated gathering systems to independent or pipeline affiliated gathering companies that are not subject to federal energy regulatory commission regulation may affect competition for gathering or natural gas marketing services in areas served by those systems and thus may affect both the costs and the nature of gathering services that will be available to interested producers or shippers in the future 
we own certain natural gas pipeline facilities that we believe meet the traditional tests which the federal energy regulatory commission has used to establish a pipeline status as a gatherer not subject to the federal energy regulatory commission jurisdiction 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the gas industry may be pending before congress  the federal energy regulatory commission  the minerals management service  state commissions and the courts 
we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
there is no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by various agencies will continue indefinitely 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we do not anticipate that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a significantly adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of consol energy or its subsidiaries 
no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
state regulation of gas operations our gas operations are also subject to regulation at the state and in some cases  county  municipal and local governmental levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the siting and construction of well pads and roads  drilling of wells  bonding requirements  protection of ground water and surface water resources and protection of drinking water supplies  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of well sites  gas flaring  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations  and gas operations producing coalbed methane in relation to active mining 
a number of states have either enacted new laws or may be considering the adequacy of existing laws affecting gathering rates and or services 
other state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental and in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements  but does not generally entail rate regulation 
thus  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny of state agencies in the future 
our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to increased state regulation of rates or services  although we do not believe that they would be affected by such regulation any differently than other natural gas producers or gatherers 
however  these regulatory burdens may affect profitability  and we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations 
ownership of mineral rights consol energy acquires ownership or leasehold rights to coal and gas properties prior to conducting operations on those properties 
as is customary in the coal and gas industries  we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to coal and gas rights that are not in our development plans  but which we believe we control 
this summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records to determine control of mineral rights 
given consol energy long history as a coal producer  we believe we have a well developed ownership position relating to our coal control  however  our ownership of oil and gas rights  particularly those rights that we acquired in connection with our historic coal operations and some of the rights we acquired from dominion is less developed 
as we continue to review our land records and confirm title in anticipation of development  we expect that adjustments to our ownership position either increases or decreases will be required 
prior to the commencement of development operations on coal or gas properties  we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects 
we generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property 
we are typically responsible for the cost of curing any title defects 
in addition  the acquisition of the necessary rights may not be feasible in some cases 
our discovering title defects which we are unable to cure may adversely impact our ability to develop those properties and we may have to reduce our estimated gas reserves including our proved undeveloped reserves 
we have completed title work on substantially all of our coal and gas producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry 
we also transferred significant rights in undeveloped shale gas properties to noble energy and hess joint ventures 
our joint venture partners have been conducting due diligence on the properties we transferred and we are in the process of reviewing defects they have asserted 
if noble or hess establish any title defects which are not resolved or if the subject acreage is reassigned to consol energy  then subject to certain deductibles  their aggregate carried cost obligation under the respective joint venture agreements will be reduced by the value the parties previously allocated to the affected acreage in the respective transactions 
a recent decision by the intermediate appellate court in pennsylvania in a case captioned butler v 
powers pa 
superior ct  no 
mda did not change the law of pennsylvania with respect to the ownership of marcellus shale gas rights  but in remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings  it called into question the applicability of a long standing presumption known as the dunham rule to gas in the marcellus shale 
the dunham rule is a presumption that a reservation or conveyance of minerals does not reserve or convey oil and gas absent an express reference to oil and gas 
an appeal of the butler v 
powers case is pending before the pennsylvania supreme court 
we believe that the pennsylvania courts will ultimately confirm that the dunham rule applies to marcellus shale gas  however  if the pennsylvania courts were to hold otherwise  we could be exposed to lawsuits challenging our rights to marcellus shale gas in some of our pennsylvania properties where our rights derive from persons who did not also own the mineral rights and we may have to incur substantial additional costs to perfect our gas title in those pennsylvania properties 
the ownership of cbm is an issue under the laws of some states  including states in which we operate 
the following summary sets forth an analysis of provisions of pennsylvania  virginia and west virginia law relating to the ownership of cbm 
these summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of applicable law and rights and the laws relating to traditional natural gas resources may differ materially from the rights related to cbm 
these summaries are based on current law as of the date of this annual report on form k 
pennsylvania in pennsylvania  cbm that remains inside the coal seam is generally the property of the owner of that coal seam where the gas is located 
cbm can be sold in place or leased by the coal owner to another party such as a producer who then would have the right to extract the gas from the coal seam under the terms of the agreement with the coal owner 
once the gas migrates from the coal into other strata  the coal owner no longer has clear title to that migrated gas 
as a result  in certain circumstances in pennsylvania eg  in a gob or mine void  we may be required to obtain other property interests beyond ownership or leasehold interest in the coal rights or cbm in order to extract gas that is no longer located in the coal seam 
we believe that under pennsylvania law  a coal lessee under a lease to exhaustion would be in the same position as the coal owner with respect to ownership of the cbm 
virginia the virginia supreme court has stated that the grant of coal rights only does not include rights to cbm  absent evidence to the contrary 
the situation may be different if there is any expression in the severance deed indicating that more than mere coal is conveyed 
virginia courts have also found that the owner of the cbm does not have the right to fracture the coal in order to retrieve the cbm and that the coal operator has the right to ventilate the cbm in the course of mining 
in virginia  we believe that we control the relevant property rights in order to capture gas from our producing properties 
when necessary  we utilize an administrative procedure established by virginia law that permits the development of cbm by an operator in those instances where the owner of the cbm has not leased it to the operator or in situations where there are conflicting claims of ownership of the cbm within a drilling unit 
the general practice is to force pool both the coal owner and the gas owner by filing an application with and obtaining an order from the virginia gas and oil board that permits the development of the cbm in the drilling unit notwithstanding lack of control of the cbm or conflicting claims of ownership 
any royalties otherwise payable to conflicting claimants are paid into escrow and the burden then is upon the conflicting claimants to establish ownership by court action 
the virginia gas and oil board does not make ownership decisions 
several lawsuits are pending in virginia state courts and several purported class action lawsuits are pending in the federal district court for the western district of virginia in abingdon  virginia  including two lawsuits to which a consol energy subsidiary is named as a defendant  which seek  among other things  a court order establishing ownership of the cbm relating to the royalties currently held in escrow 
west virginia the ownership of cbm is largely an open question in west virginia 
the west virginia supreme court has held that under a conventional oil and gas lease executed prior to the inception of widespread public knowledge regarding cbm operations  the oil and gas lessee did not acquire the right to produce cbm 
the west virginia courts have not further clarified who owns cbm in west virginia 
west virginia has enacted the coalbed methane wells and units act the west virginia act  regulating the commercial recovery and marketing of cbm 
although the west virginia act does not specify who owns  or has the right to exploit  cbm in west virginia and instead refers ownership disputes to judicial resolution  it contains provisions similar to virginia force pooling law described above 
under the pooling provisions of the west virginia act  an applicant who proposes to drill can prosecute an administrative proceeding with the west virginia coalbed methane review board to obtain authority to produce cbm from pooled acreage 
owners and claimants of cbm interests who have not consented to the drilling are afforded certain elective forms of participation in the drilling eg  royalty or owner  but their consent is not required to obtain a pooling order authorizing the production of cbm by the operator within the boundaries of the drilling unit 
the west virginia act also provides that  where title to subsurface minerals has been severed in such a way that title to coal and title to natural gas are vested in different persons  the operator of a cbm well permitted  drilled and completed under color of title to the cbm from either the coal seam owner or the natural gas owner has an affirmative defense to an action for willful trespass relating to the drilling and commercial production of cbm from that well 
other states we have rights to extract cbm where we have coal rights in other states 
the ownership of cbm in the illinois basin and certain other western basins may be uncertain or could belong to other holders of real estate interests and we may need to acquire additional rights from other holders of real estate interests to extract and produce cbm in these other states available information consol energy maintains a website on the world wide web at www

risk factors investment in our securities is subject to various risks  including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business 
the following sets forth factors related to our business  operations  financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss 
deterioration in the global economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate  or sustained uncertainty in financial markets  may have adverse impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
economic conditions in a number of industries in which our customers operate  such as electric power generation and steel making  substantially deteriorated in recent years and reduced the demand for natural gas and coal 
although global industrial activity recovered in and from levels  it weakened in and the outlook is uncertain  especially for europe which continues to be affected by sovereign debt issues and the united states which may significantly increase taxes and cut government spending to address deficits 
in addition  in and financial markets in the united states  europe and asia also experienced unprecedented turmoil and upheaval 
this was characterized by extreme volatility and declines in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  inability to access capital markets  the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government and other governments 
although we cannot predict the impacts  renewed weakness in the economic conditions of any of the industries we serve or in the financial markets could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
for example demand for natural gas and electricity in the united states is impacted by industrial production  which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues  margins and profitability of our natural gas and thermal coal business  demand for metallurgical coal depends on steel demand in the united states and globally  which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues  margins and profitability of our metallurgical coal business including our ability to sell our high volatile steam coal as higher priced metallurgical coal  the tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect our ability to collect our trade receivables and the amount of receivables eligible for sale pursuant to our accounts receivable securitization facility may decline  our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital for our business including for exploration and or development of our coal or gas reserves  and our commodity hedging arrangements could become ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection 
an extended decline in demand for or the prices consol energy receives for coal and natural gas will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our financial results are significantly affected by the demand for and the prices we receive for our coal and natural gas 
coal accounted for approximately of our revenues in prices of and demand for our coal may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control such as overall domestic and global economic conditions  technological advances affecting energy consumption  price and availability of foreign coal  and domestic and foreign government regulations  the consumption pattern of industrial consumers  electricity generators and residential users as well as weather can impact thermal coal for example  the unusually warm winter left utilities with large coal stockpiles and depressed the demand for thermal coal  the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation  especially natural gas for example  abundant natural gas supplies at prices averaging less than mmbtu during depressed the demand for thermal coal as natural gas fired electricity generation market share increased from approximately in to in and coal fired generation declined from approximately in to in  and increased utilization by the steel industry of electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal processes to make steel which do not use furnace coke  an intermediate product produced from metallurgical coal  decreases the demand for metallurgical coal 
decreased demand and extended or substantial price declines for coal adversely affect our operating results for future periods and our ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations 
for example  in domestic and global economic deterioration  unusually warm winter weather and abundant cheap natural gas decreased demand for our coal as well as decreased the average sales price for our metallurgical coal and resulted in our coal revenues and earnings before income taxes significantly declining from natural gas accounted for approximately of our revenues in natural gas prices are very volatile  and even relatively modest drops in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede growth 
prices for natural gas may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as the domestic supply of natural gas  the consumption pattern of industrial consumers  electricity generators and residential users and weather conditions  proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  overall domestic and global economic conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  especially thermal coal  and the price and supply of imported liquefied natural gas 
in particular  while demand for natural gas has recovered to pre recession levels  the us natural gas industry continues to face concerns of oversupply due to the success of new shale plays and continued drilling in these plays  despite lower gas prices  to meet drilling commitments 
the oversupply of natural gas has resulted in prices hovering around ten year lows 
low gas prices adversely impacts our gas operations revenues and earnings before income taxes 
for example  in as a result of low gas prices  our gas operations revenues and earnings before income taxes significantly declined from an extended period of lower natural gas prices could negatively affect us in several other ways 
these include reduced cash flow  which would decrease funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves or increase production 
for example  in light of the low natural gas prices during  the number of wells drilled in our noble joint venture during was significantly reduced from the number initially planned to be drilled 
also  our access to other sources of capital  such as equity or long term debt markets  could be severely limited or unavailable 
additionally  lower natural gas prices may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically 
this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
if this occurs  or if our estimates of development costs increase  production data factors change or our exploration results deteriorate  accounting rules may require us to write down  as a non cash charge to earnings  the carrying value of our natural gas properties 
we are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management plans change with respect to those assets 
we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
we and our joint venture partners have increased drilling activity in areas of shale formations which may also contain natural gas liquids and or oil 
the prices for natural gas liquids and oil are volatile for reasons similar to those described above regarding natural gas 
similar to the oversupply of natural gas  increased drilling activity in by third parties in formations containing natural gas liquids has led to a significant decline in the price of natural gas liquids 
if we discover and produce significant amounts of natural gas liquids or oil  our results of operation may be adversely affected by downward fluctuations in natural gas liquids and oil prices if coal customers do not extend existing contracts or do not enter into new long term coal contracts  profitability of consol energy operations could be affected 
during the year ended december   approximately of the coal consol energy produced was sold under long term contracts contracts with terms of one year or more 
if a substantial portion of consol energy long term contracts are modified or terminated or if force majeure is exercised  consol energy would be adversely affected if we are unable to replace the contracts or if new contracts are not at the same level of profitability 
if existing customers do not honor current contract commitments  our revenue would be adversely affected 
the profitability of our long term coal supply contracts depends on a variety of factors  which vary from contract to contract and fluctuate during the contract term  including our production costs and other factors 
price changes  if any  provided in long term supply contracts may not reflect our cost increases  and therefore  increases in our costs may reduce our profit margins 
in addition  in periods of declining market prices  provisions in our long term coal contracts for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility 
as a result  consol energy may not be able to obtain long term agreements at favorable prices compared to either market conditions  as they may change from time to time  or our cost structure  and long term contracts may not contribute to our profitability 
the loss of  or significant reduction in  purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues 
for the year ended december   we derived over of our total revenues from sales to two coal customers individually and more than of our total revenue from sales to our four largest coal and gas customers 
at december   we had approximately twenty seven coal supply agreements with these customers that expire at various times from to we are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long term agreements with some of these customers  but these negotiations may not be successful and these customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long term coal supply agreements 
if any one of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us  or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us 
our ability to receive payment for coal and gas sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers 
some power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade 
if the creditworthiness of our customers declines significantly  our million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal for which they have an existing contractual obligation  our revenues will decrease and we may have to reduce production at our mines until our customer contractual obligations are honored 
the availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to our customers 
similarly  our gas business depends on gathering  processing and transportation facilities owned by others and the disruption of  capacity constraints in  or proximity to pipeline systems could limit sales of our natural gas 
coal producers depend upon rail  barge  trucking  overland conveyor and other systems to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lock outs  break downs of locks and dams or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect our profitability 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make our coal less competitive 
we gather  process and transport our gas to market by utilizing pipelines and facilities owned by others 
for example  we rely upon one gas processing facility located in pennsylvania owned by markwest energy partners to process all of our gas which contains natural gas liquids 
if pipeline or facility capacity is limited  or if pipeline or facility capacity is unexpectedly disrupted  our gas sales and or sales of natural gas liquids could be limited  reducing our profitability 
if we cannot access processing pipeline transportation facilities  we may have to reduce our production of gas or vent our produced gas to the atmosphere because we do not have facilities to store excess inventory 
if our sales of gas or natural gas liquids are reduced because of transportation or processing constraints  our revenues will be reduced  and our unit costs will also increase 
if pipeline quality tariffs change  we might be required to install additional processing equipment which could increase our costs 
the pipeline could also curtail our flows until the gas delivered to their pipeline is in compliance 
competition within the coal and natural gas industries may adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
increased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect our sales of  or our prices for  our coal and natural gas products  which could impair our profitability 
consol energy competes with coal producers in various regions of the united states and with some foreign coal producers for domestic sales primarily to electric power generators 
consol energy also competes with both domestic and foreign coal producers for sales in international markets 
demand for our coal by our principal customers is affected by the delivered price of competing coals  other fuel supplies and alternative generating sources  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  such as hydroelectric and wind power 
consol energy sells coal to foreign electricity generators and to the more specialized metallurgical coal market  both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition 
increases in coal prices could encourage existing producers to expand capacity or could encourage new producers to enter the market 
if overcapacity results  prices could fall or we may not be able to sell our coal  which would reduce revenue 
the gas industry is intensely competitive with companies from various regions of the united states 
we compete with these companies and we may compete with foreign companies for domestic sales 
many of the companies we compete with are larger and have greater financial  technological  human and other resources 
if we are unable to compete  our company  our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected 
in addition  larger companies may be able to pay more to acquire new gas properties for future exploration  limiting our ability to replace natural gas we produce or to grow our production 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover new natural gas resources also depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate these transactions in a highly competitive environment 
we could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations 
as of december   we had  employees 
approximately of these employees are represented by the united mine workers of america umwa and represented operations generated approximately of our us coal production during the year ended december  relations with our employees and  where applicable  organized labor relations are important to our success 
if we do not maintain satisfactory labor relations with our organized and non represented employees  we may incur strikes  other work stoppages or have reduced productivity 
the characteristics of coal may make it costly for electric power generators and other coal users to comply with various environmental standards regarding the emissions of impurities released when coal is burned which could cause utilities to replace coal fired power plants with alternative fuels 
in addition  various incentives have been proposed to encourage the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources 
a reduction in the use of coal for electric power generation could decrease the volume of our coal sales and adversely affect our results of operation 
coal contains impurities  including sulfur  mercury  chlorine and other elements or compounds  many of which are released into the air along with fine particulate matter and carbon dioxide when coal is burned 
complying with regulations on these emissions can be costly for electric power generators 
for example  in order to meet the federal clean air act limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants  coal users will need to install scrubbers  use sulfur dioxide emission allowances some of which they may purchase  or switch to other fuels 
each option has limitations 
lower sulfur coal may be more costly to purchase on an energy basis than higher sulfur coal depending on mining and transportation costs 
the cost of installing scrubbers is significant and emission allowances may become more expensive as their availability declines 
switching to other fuels may require expensive modification of existing plants 
because higher sulfur coal currently accounts for a significant portion of our sales  the extent to which electric power generators switch to alternative fuel could materially affect us 
adoption of the cross state air pollution rule caspr in july to be effective january   but currently subject to a stay and the mercury and air toxic standards rule mats remanded by the court and reproposed by epa in november requiring reductions in emissions of mercury  sulfur dioxides  nitrogen oxides  and particulate matter may require the installation of additional costly control technology or the implementation of other measures  including trading of emission allowances and switching to alternative fuels 
these additional reductions in permissible emission levels of impurities by coal fired plants will likely make it more costly to operate coal fired electric power plants and may make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for electric power generation in the future 
another source of uncertainty is the consideration of regulation of coal ash disposal by epa 
in may  epa proposed new approaches for the regulation of coal combustion residuals from electric generating facilities 
epa is re evaluating its august and may bevill determinations that currently provide exemptions for certain materials 
apart from actual and potential regulation of emissions from coal fired plants  state and federal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources could have an impact on the market for our coal 
several states have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power 
there have been numerous proposals to establish a similar uniform  national standard although none of these proposals have been enacted to date 
possible advances in technologies and incentives  such as tax credits  to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal 
any reductions in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electric power generators as a result of current or new standards for the emission of impurities or incentives to switch to alternative fuels or renewable energy sources could reduce the demand for our coal  thereby reducing our revenues and adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions as well as uncertainty concerning such regulation could adversely impact the market for coal and natural gas and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our operating costs and reduce the value of our coal and gas assets 
while climate change legislation in the us is unlikely in the next several years  the issue of global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention with widespread concern about the impacts of human activity  especially the emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs  such as carbon dioxide and methane 
combustion of fossil fuels  such as the coal and gas we produce  results in the creation of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by coal and gas end users  such as coal fired electric power generation plants 
numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international  national  regional and state levels of government that are intended to limit emissions of ghgs 
several states have already adopted measures requiring reduction of ghgs within state boundaries 
internationally  the kyoto protocol  which set binding emission targets for developed countries including the united states but has not been ratified by the united states  and canada officially withdrew from its kyoto commitment in was nominally extended past its expiration date of december with a requirement for a new legal construct to be put into place by regulation of ghgs could occur in the united states pursuant to the environmental protection agency epa regulation under the clean air act 
on march   epa proposed a carbon pollution standard for new power plants that would  for the first time  set national limits on the amount of carbon pollution that new power plants can emit 
on june  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia rejected a legal challenge by a coalition of trade associations which questioned epa authority to regulate ghgs under the clean air act 
in july  epa issued its final greenhouse gas requirements for existing facilities emitting at least  tons year of carbon dioxide equivalent coe to obtain permits for prevention of significant deterioration under the clean air act 
apart from governmental regulation  on february   three of wall street largest investment banks announced that they had adopted climate change guidelines for lenders 
the guidelines require the evaluation of carbon risks in the financing of electric power generation plants which may make it more difficult for utilities to obtain financing for coal fired plants 
if comprehensive legislation or regulation focusing on ghgs emission reductions is adopted for the united states or other countries where we sell coal  or if utilities were to have difficulty obtaining financing in connection with coal fired plants  it may make it more costly to operate fossil fuel fired especially coal fired electric power generation plants and make fossil fuels less attractive for electric utility power plants in the future 
depending on the nature of the regulation or legislation  natural gas fueled power generation could become more economically attractive than coal fueled power generation  substantially increasing the demand for natural gas 
apart from actual regulation  uncertainty over the regulation of ghg emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new coal fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal fired plants 
any reduction in the amount of coal or possibly natural gas consumed by domestic electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could decrease demand for our fossil fuels  thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
we or our customers may also have to invest in carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies in order to burn coal or natural gas and comply with future ghg emission standards 
in addition  coalbed methane must be expelled from our underground coal mines for mining safety reasons 
coalbed methane has a greater ghg effect than carbon dioxide 
our gas operations capture coalbed methane from our underground coal mines  although some coalbed methane is vented into the atmosphere when the coal is mined 
if regulation of ghg emissions does not exempt the release of coalbed methane  we may have to further reduce our methane emissions  pay higher taxes  incur costs to purchase credits that permit us to continue operations as they now exist at our underground coal mines or perhaps curtail coal production 
the amount of coalbed methane we emit is reported annually to the federal and state regulatory agencies  as well as in our annual corporate responsibility report 
we have recorded the amounts we have captured since the early s 
foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad 
we compete in international markets against coal produced in other countries 
coal is sold internationally in us dollars 
as a result  mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in us dollar terms based on currency exchange rates  providing an advantage to foreign coal producers 
currency fluctuations among countries purchasing and selling coal could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets 
our coal mining and natural gas operations are subject to operating risks  which could increase our operating expenses and decrease our production levels which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our coal and gas operations are also subject to hazards and any losses or liabilities we suffer from hazards which occur in our operations may not be fully covered by our insurance policies 
our coal mining operations are predominantly underground mines 
these mines are subject to a number of operating risks that could disrupt operations  decrease production and increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results 
in addition  if coal production declines  we may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to deliver under our long term coal contracts 
consol energy inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in our customers initiating claims against us 
the operating risks that may have a significant impact on our coal operations include variations in thickness of the layer  or seam  of coal  amounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the coal seam and other geological conditions that could affect the stability of the roof and the side walls of the mine  equipment failures or repairs  fires  explosions or other accidents  weather conditions  and security breaches or terroristic acts 
our exploration for and production of natural gas also involves numerous operating risks 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating our shale gas wells  shallow oil and gas wells and coalbed methane cbm wells is often uncertain  and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations  decrease production and or increase the cost of our gas operations at particular sites for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results 
the operating risks that may have a significant impact on our gas operations include unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in geologic formations  equipment failures or repairs  fires  explosions or other accidents  adverse weather conditions  reductions in natural gas prices  security breaches or terroristic acts  pipeline ruptures  lack of adequate capacity for treatment or disposal of waste water generated in drilling  completion and production operations  environmental contamination from surface spillage of fluids used in well drilling  completion or operation including fracturing fluids used in hydraulic fracturing of wells  or other contamination of groundwater or the environment resulting from our use of such fluids  and unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  other field services and equipment 
although we maintain insurance for a number of hazards  we may not be insured or fully insured against the losses or liabilities that could arise from a significant accident in our coal or gas operations 
a decrease in the availability or increase in the costs of commodities or capital equipment used in mining operations could decrease our coal production  impact our cost of coal production and decrease our anticipated profitability 
coal mining consumes large quantities of commodities including steel  copper  rubber products and liquid fuels and requires the use of capital equipment 
some commodities  such as steel  are needed to comply with roof control plans required by regulation 
the prices we pay for commodities and capital equipment are strongly impacted by the global market 
a rapid or significant increase in the costs of commodities or capital equipment we use in our operations could impact our mining operations costs because we may have a limited ability to negotiate lower prices  and  in some cases  may not have a ready substitute 
we rely upon third party contractors to provide various field services to our coal and gas operations 
a decrease in the availability of or an increase in the prices charged by third party contractors or failure of third party contractors to provide quality services to us in a timely manner could decrease our production  increase our costs of production  and decrease our anticipated profitability 
we rely upon third party contractors to provide key services to our gas operations 
we contract with third parties for well services  related equipment  and qualified experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations 
the demand for these field services in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly 
higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand causing periodic shortages 
these shortages may lead to escalating prices for drilling equipment  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services 
shortages may lead to poor service and inefficient drilling operations and increase the possibility of accidents due to the hiring of inexperienced personnel and overuse of equipment by contractors 
in addition  the costs and delivery times of equipment and supplies are substantially greater in periods of peak demand 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain necessary drilling equipment and supplies in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms  and we may experience shortages of  or increases in the costs of  drilling equipment  crews and associated supplies  equipment and field services in the future 
we also use third party contractors to provide construction and specialized services to our mining operations 
a decrease in the availability of field services or equipment and supplies  an increase in the prices charged for field services  equipment and supplies  or the failure of third party contractors to provide quality field services to us  could decrease our coal and gas production  increase our costs of coal and gas production  and decrease our anticipated profitability 
we attempt to mitigate the risks involved with increased industrial activity by entering into take or pay contracts with well service providers which commit them to provide field services to us at specified levels and commit us to pay for field services at specified levels even if we do not use those services 
however  these contracts expose us to economic risk 
for example  if the price of natural gas declines and it is not economical to drill and produce additional natural gas  we may have to pay for field services that we did not use 
this would decrease our cash flow and raise our costs of production 
for mining and drilling operations  consol energy must obtain  maintain  and renew governmental permits and approvals which if we cannot obtain in a timely manner would reduce our production  cash flow and results of operations 
most coal producers in the eastern us are being impacted by government regulations and enforcement to a much greater extent than a few years ago  particularly in light of the renewed focus by environmental agencies and the government generally on the mining industry  including more stringent enforcement and interpretation of the laws that regulate mining 
the pace with which the government issues permits needed for new operations and for on going operations to continue mining has negatively impacted expected production  especially in central appalachia 
environmental groups in southern west virginia and kentucky have challenged state and us army corps of engineers permits for mountaintop and types of surface mining operations on various grounds 
the most recent challenges have focused on the adequacy of the u 
s army corps of engineers analysis of impacts to streams and the adequacy of mitigation plans to compensate for stream impacts resulting from valley fill permits required for mountaintop mining 
these challenges have also enhanced the epa oversight and involvement in the review of permits by state regulatory authorities 
in  the us district court for the southern district of west virginia found other operators permits for mining in these areas to be deficient 
in february  the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed that decision  finding that the permits were adequate 
the epa objections and an enhanced review process that was being implemented under a federal multi agency memorandum of understanding effectively held up the issuance of permits for all types of mining operations that require clean water act section discharge permits and section dredge and fill permits  including surface facilities for underground mines 
the epa enhanced review process was invalidated in october  in part because the epa failed to follow public notice and rulemaking requirements  and on july   the federal district court for the district of columbia struck down epa guidance memorandum for coal related water permitting actions in which epa recommended permits include limits on specific conductivity which currently neither epa nor the states have a standard 
however  normal permitting has not yet resumed 
also  the epa may elect to seek to adopt regulations to codify its enhanced review process 
consol energy surface and underground operations have been impacted to a limited extent to date  but a permit for a new mine was impacted which resulted in the issuance of a worker adjustment and retraining notification warn which affected some employees on october  consol energy was able  in this instance  to redeploy these employees to work at another adjacent coal mine property for which a permit was already issued 
however  there is no assurance that the permit for the new coal mine will be issued  or that consol energy would be able to re deploy its employees under future similar circumstances 
in addition  the length of time needed to bring a new mine into production has increased by several years because of the increased time required to obtain necessary permits 
these delays or denials of mining permits could reduce our production  cash flow and results of operations 
existing and future government laws  regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment  and others that govern our business may increase our costs of doing business for coal and may restrict our coal operations 
we are subject to laws  regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal  state and local  as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment 
these include those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  groundwater quality and availability  threatened and endangered plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining or drilling properties after mining or drilling is completed  the installation of various safety equipment in our mines  remediation of impacts of surface subsidence from underground mining  and work practices related to employee health and safety 
complying with these requirements  including the terms of our permits  has had  and will continue to have  a significant affect on our costs of operations and competitive position 
for example  we have agreed to commence operation by may   of a new advanced waste water treatment plant to treat the discharge of mine water from our blacksville  loveridge and robinson run mines at a total estimated cost of approximately million 
in addition  there is the possibility that we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations under environmental laws 
any additional laws  regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal  state and local  as well as foreign authorities or new interpretations of existing legal requirements by regulatory bodies relating to the protection of the environment matters could further affect our costs of operations and competitive position 
the clean water act is being used by opponents of mountain top removal mining as a means to challenge permits 
in addition  consol energy incurs and will continue to incur costs associated with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act superfund and similar state statutes and has been named as a potentially responsible party at superfund sites in the past 
existing and future government laws  regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment  and others that govern our business may increase our costs of doing business for natural gas  and may restrict both our gas operations 
state and local authorities regulate various aspects of gas drilling and production activities  including the drilling of wells through permit and bonding requirements  the spacing of wells  the unitization or pooling of gas properties  environmental matters  safety standards  market sharing and well site restoration 
additionally  regulations applicable to the gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion at the federal and state level 
any future changes may affect  among other things  the pricing or marketing of gas production 
for example  hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations such as marcellus shale 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
hydraulic fracturing is currently exempt from regulation under the federal safe drinking water act  except for hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel 
the disposal of produced water  drilling fluids and other wastes in underground injection disposal wells is regulated by the epa under the federal safe drinking water act or by the states under counterpart state laws and regulations 
the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations or to dispose of waste resulting from such operations 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities with a final report to be issued in other federal agencies are also examining hydraulic fracturing  including the us department of energy doe  the us government accountability office and the department of the interior 
also  some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  regulations that could restrict or impose additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances 
if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level  our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs 
additionally  some states have begun to adopt more stringent regulation and oversight of natural gas gathering lines than is currently required by federal standards 
pennsylvania  under act  authorized the public utility commission oversight of class i gathering lines  as well as requiring standards and fees associated with class ii and class iii pipelines 
the state of ohio also moved to regulate natural gas gathering lines in a similar manner pursuant to ohio senate bill sb 
sb expanded the puc authority over rural natural gas gathering lines 
these changes in interpretation and regulation affect consol energy midstream activities  requiring changes in reporting as well as increased costs 
further  some state and local governments in the marcellus shale region in pennsylvania and new york have considered or imposed a temporary moratorium on drilling operations using hydraulic fracturing until further study of the potential for environmental and human health impacts by the epa or the relevant agencies are completed 
no assurance can be given as to whether or not similar measures might be considered or implemented in other jurisdictions in which our gas properties are located 
if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict or otherwise impact hydraulic fracturing are passed by congress or adopted in states in which we operate  such legal requirements could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby could affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable 
new laws or regulations could also cause delays or interruptions or terminations of operations  the extent of which cannot be predicted  and could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we ultimately are able to produce in commercially paying quantities from our gas properties  all of which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operation and financial condition 
our shale gas drilling and production operations require both adequate sources of water to use in the fracturing process as well as the ability to dispose of water and other wastes after hydraulic fracturing 
our cbm gas drilling and production operations also require the removal and disposal of water from the coal seams from which we produce gas 
if we cannot find adequate sources of water for our use or are unable to dispose of the water we use or remove it from the strata at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules  our ability to produce gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired 
as part of our drilling and production in the marcellus shale  we use hydraulic fracturing processes 
thus  we need access to adequate sources of water to use in our marcellus shale operations 
further  we must remove and dispose of the portion of the water that we use to fracture our shale gas wells that flows back to the well bore as well as drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of natural gas 
in addition  in our cbm drilling and production  coal seams frequently contain water that must be removed and disposed of in order for the gas to detach from the coal and flow to the well bore 
our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water with respect to our marcellus shale operations  or the inability to dispose of or recycle water and other wastes used in our marcellus shale and our cbm operations  could adversely impact our operations 
for example  in ohio  injection of gas well production fluids was temporarily suspended for underground injection disposal wells near youngstown while regulatory authorities investigated whether injection of wastewater into the wells was causing low category earthquakes in the area 
our mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing business at active operations and may place restrictions on our methods of operation 
in addition  government inspectors under certain circumstances  have the ability to order our operations to be shut down based on safety considerations 
a mine could be shut down for an extended period of time if a disaster were to occur at it 
stringent health and safety standards were imposed by federal legislation when the federal coal mine health and safety act of was adopted 
the federal coal mine safety and health act of expanded the enforcement of safety and health standards of the coal mine health and safety act of and imposed safety and health standards on all non coal as well as coal mining operations 
regulations are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations  including training of mine personnel  mining procedures  the equipment used in mine emergency procedures  mine plans and other matters 
the additional requirements of the mine improvement and new emergency response act of the miner act and implementing federal regulations include  among other things  expanded emergency response plans  providing additional quantities of breathable air for emergencies  installation of refuge chambers in underground coal mines  installation of two way communications and tracking systems for underground coal mines  new standards for sealing mined out areas of underground coal mines  more available mine rescue teams and enhanced training for emergencies 
most states in which consol energy operates have programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement 
we believe that the combination of federal and state safety and health regulations in the coal mining industry is  perhaps  the most comprehensive system for protection of employee safety and health affecting any industry 
most aspects of mine operations  particularly underground mine operations  are subject to extensive regulation 
the various requirements mandated by law or regulation can place restrictions on our methods of operations  creating a significant effect on operating costs and productivity 
in addition  government inspectors under certain circumstances  have the ability to order our operation to be shut down based on safety considerations 
if a disaster were to occur at one of our mines  it could be shut down for an extended period of time and our reputation with our customers could be materially damaged 
our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances  and our properties may have environmental contamination  which could result in liabilities to us 
our operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time 
drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals  a condition referred to as acid mine drainage 
we could become subject to claims for toxic torts  natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean up of soil  surface water  groundwater  and other media 
such claims may arise  for example  out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate  as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated  or may acquire 
our liability for such claims may be joint and several  so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages  or for the entire share 
we maintain extensive coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at a number of our mining complexes 
such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation 
our coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments are designed  constructed  and inspected by our company and by regulatory authorities according to stringent environmental and safety standards 
structural failure of a slurry impoundment or coal refuse area could result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources  such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches  as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages  and injuries to wildlife 
some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas  which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of damages arising out of failure 
if one of our impoundments were to fail  we could be subject to claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability  as well as for fines and penalties 
in west virginia there are areas where drainage from coal mining operations contains concentrations of selenium that without treatment would result in violations of state water quality standards that are set to protect fish and other aquatic life 
consol energy has two operations with selenium discharges 
consol energy and other coal companies are working to expeditiously develop cost effective means to remove selenium from mine water 
if such technology or processes are not developed promptly  the only available effective treatment technologies are expensive to construct and operate which will increase coal production costs 
these and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment  as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations  could result in costs and liabilities that could adversely affect us 
an example of this is naturally occurring radioactive material norm or technologically enhanced  naturally occurring radioactive material tenorm 
norm or tenorm is produced when activities such as sewage sludge treatment or deep drilling concentrate or expose radioactive materials that occur naturally in ores  soils  water  or other natural materials 
state and federal agencies are examining the possibility for worker exposure or associated environmental hazards due to processing and disposal of wastes 
consol energy operations could be affected if there is a hazard associated with norm tenorm or if it were to be regulated in such a way as to require expensive treatment and disposal options 
consol energy has reclamation  mine closing and gas well plugging obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
also  state laws require us to plug gas wells and reclaim well sites after the useful life of our gas wells has ended 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance  gas well plugging and of final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation  mine closing liabilities and gas well plugging  which are based upon permit requirements and our experience  were approximately million at december  the amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future closure costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rates 
furthermore  these obligations are unfunded 
if these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
most states where we operate require us to post bonds for the full cost of coal mine reclamation full cost bonding 
west virginia is not a full cost bonding state 
west virginia has an alternative bond system abs for coal mine reclamation which consists of i individual site bonds posted by the permittee that are less than the full estimated reclamation cost plus ii a bond pool special reclamation fund funded by a per ton fee on coal mined in the state which is used to supplement the site specific bonds if needed in the event of bond forfeiture 
the special reclamation fund is currently underfunded  and the adequacy of the fund became subject to a citizen suit before the us district court in west virginia 
in an effort to settle the issue in  the wv legislature authorized an increase in the per ton fee levied on coal production to make up the shortfall 
there remains the possibility that wv may move to full cost bonding in the future which could cause individual mining companies and or surety companies to exceed bonding capacity and would result in the need to post cash bonds or letters of credit which would reduce operating capital 
pennsylvania has begun to enforce full cost bonding for new capital projects  further increasing the amount of surety bonds consol energy must seek in order to permit its mining activities 
consol energy faces uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable coal reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs  including the cost of materials 
in addition  we hold substantial coal reserves in areas containing marcellus shale and other shales 
these areas are currently the subject of substantial exploration for oil and gas  particularly by horizontal drilling 
if a well is in the path of our mining for coal  we may not be able to mine through the well unless we purchase it 
although in the past we have purchased vertical wells  the cost of purchasing a producing horizontal well could be substantially greater 
horizontal wells with multiple laterals extending from the well pad may access larger oil and gas reserves than a vertical well which could result in higher costs 
in future years  the cost associated with purchasing oil and gas wells which are in the path of our coal mining may make mining through those wells uneconomical thereby effectively causing a loss of significant portions of our coal reserves 
similarly  natural gas reserves require subjective estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas and assumptions concerning natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs 
as a result  estimated quantities of proved gas reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect 
over time  material changes to reserve estimates may be made  taking into account the results of actual drilling  testing and production 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of our gas reserves  the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of gas reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows 
numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based  as described above  often result in the actual quantities of gas we ultimately recover being different from reserve estimates 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved gas reserves on historical average prices and costs 
however  actual future net cash flows from our gas and oil properties also will be affected by factors such as geological conditions  changes in governmental regulations and taxation  the amount and timing of actual production  assumptions governing future prices  future operating costs  and capital costs of drilling new wells 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 
in addition  if natural gas prices decline by per thousand cubic feet  then the pre tax present value using a discount rate of our proved gas reserves as of december  would decrease from billion to billion 
the standardized generally accepted accounting principle measure associated with this decline of per thousand cubic feet  would be approximately million 
each of the factors which impacts reserve estimation may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating the reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of coal and gas reserves may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our coal and gas reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
as a result  our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual coal and gas reserves 
defects may exist in our chain of title for our coal estate and we have not done a thorough chain of title examination of our gas estate 
we may incur additional costs and delays to produce coal and gas because we have to acquire additional property rights to perfect our title to coal or gas rights 
if we fail to acquire additional property rights to perfect our title to coal or gas rights  we may have to reduce our estimated reserves 
while chain of title for our coal estate generally has been established  there may be defects in it that we do not realize until we have committed to developing those properties or coal reserves 
as such  the title to the coal estate that we intend to mine may contain defects 
in order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist  we may incur unanticipated costs perfecting title 
if we cannot cure these defects  we may have to reduce our coal reserves 
substantial amounts of acreage in which we believe we control gas rights are in areas where we have not yet done a thorough chain of title examination of the gas estate 
a number of our gas properties were acquired primarily for the coal rights with the focus on the coal estate title  and  in many cases were acquired years ago 
in addition  we have acquired gas rights in substantial acreage from third parties who had not performed thorough chain of title work on their gas properties 
our practice  and we believe industry practice  is not to perform a thorough title examination on gas properties until shortly before the commencement of drilling activities at which time we seek to acquire any additional rights needed to perfect our ownership of the gas estate for development and production purposes 
when we perform a thorough chain of title examination  we may discover material defects in our title which would require us to acquire additional property rights 
we may incur substantial costs to acquire these additional property rights 
in addition  the acquisition of the necessary rights may not be feasible in some cases 
our discovering title defects which we are unable to cure may adversely impact our ability to develop those properties and we may have to reduce our estimated gas reserves including our proved undeveloped reserves 
some states west virginia and virginia permit us to produce coalbed methane gas without perfected ownership under an administrative process known as pooling  which require us to give notice to all potential claimants and pay royalties into escrow until the undetermined rights are resolved 
as a result  we may have to pay royalties to produce coalbed methane gas on acreage that we control and these costs may be material 
further  the pooling process is time consuming and may delay our drilling program in the affected areas 
in confirming title to the gas estate in pennsylvania  we rely upon long standing pennsylvania supreme court decisions 
a recent decision by the intermediate appellate court in pennsylvania in a case captioned butler v 
powers pa 
superior ct  no 
mda did not change the law of pennsylvania  but in remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings  it called into question the applicability of a long standing presumption known as the dunham rule to gas in the marcellus shale 
the dunham rule is a presumption that a reservation or conveyance of minerals does not transfer the ownership of oil and gas absent an express reference to oil and gas 
while we believe that the pennsylvania courts will ultimately confirm that the dunham rule applies to marcellus shale gas  if the pennsylvania courts were to hold otherwise  we could be exposed to lawsuits challenging our rights to marcellus shale gas in some of our pennsylvania properties where our rights derive from persons who did not also own the mineral rights and we may have to incur substantial additional costs to perfect our gas title in those pennsylvania properties 
our subsidiaries  primarily fairmont supply company  are co defendants in various asbestos litigation cases which could result in making payments in the future that are material 
one of our subsidiaries  fairmont supply company fairmont  which distributes industrial supplies  currently is named as a defendant in approximately  asbestos related claims in state courts in pennsylvania  ohio  west virginia  maryland  texas and illinois 
because a very small percentage of products manufactured by third parties and supplied by fairmont in the past may have contained asbestos and many of the pending claims are part of mass complaints filed by hundreds of plaintiffs against a hundred or more defendants  it has been difficult for fairmont to determine how many of the cases actually involve valid claims or plaintiffs who were actually exposed to asbestos containing products supplied by fairmont 
in addition  while fairmont may be entitled to indemnity or contribution in certain jurisdictions from manufacturers of identified products  the availability of such indemnity or contribution is unclear at this time  and in recent years  some of the manufacturers named as defendants in these actions have sought protection from these claims under bankruptcy laws 
fairmont has no insurance coverage with respect to these asbestos cases 
past payments by fairmont with respect to asbestos cases have not been material  however  it is reasonably possible that payments in the future with respect to pending or future asbestos cases may be material to the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of consol energy 
consol energy and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings  which may have an adverse effect on our business 
we are party to a number of legal proceedings in the normal course of business activities 
defending these actions  especially purported class actions  can be costly  and can distract management 
for example  we are a defendant in five pending purported class action lawsuits dealing with such diverse matters as the propriety of our acquisition of the noncontrolling interest of cnx gas  our right to natural gas production in some areas  and asserting that we are responsible for hurricane katrina and the damage it caused 
there is the potential that the costs of defending litigation in an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
see note commitments and contingent liabilities in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion of pending legal proceedings 
consol energy has obligations for long term employee benefits for which we accrue based upon assumptions which  if inaccurate  could result in consol energy being required to expense greater amounts than anticipated 
consol energy provides various long term employee benefits to inactive and retired employees 
we accrue amounts for these obligations 
at december   the current and non current portions of these obligations included postretirement medical and life insurance billion  coal workers black lung benefits million  salaried retirement benefits million  and workers compensation million 
however  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
salary retirement benefits are funded in accordance with employer retirement income security act of erisa regulations 
the other obligations are unfunded 
in addition  the federal government and several states in which we operate consider changes in workers compensation and black lung laws from time to time 
such changes  if enacted  could increase our benefit expense 
due to our participation in an underfunded multi employer pension plan  we have exposure under that plan that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees and in the future we may have to make additional cash contributions to fund the pension plan or incur withdrawal liability 
certain of our subsidiaries have been contributing to a multi employer defined benefit pension plan pension trust for united mine workers of america umwa retirees under the terms of various national bituminous coal wage agreements nbcwa which those subsidiaries have entered into over the years with the umwa 
the current nbcwa with the umwa became effective july  and expires on december  all assets contributed to the pension trust are pooled and available to provide benefits for all participants and beneficiaries 
as a result  contributions made by our signatory subsidiaries benefit employees of consol energy and of other employers 
for the plan year ended june   approximately of retirees and surviving spouses receiving benefits from the pension trust last worked at signatory subsidiaries of consol energy 
the pension trust is overseen by a board of trustees  consisting of two union appointed trustees and two employer appointed trustees 
the trustees responsibilities include selection of the plan investment policy  asset allocation  individual investment of plan assets and the administration of the plan 
the benefits provided by the pension trust to the participating employees are determined based on age and years of service at retirement 
the current nbcwa calls for contribution amounts to be paid to the pension trust by our signatory subsidiaries during the term of the nbcwa based principally on hours worked by our umwa represented employees at a contribution rate of per hour 
as of june   the most recent date for which information is available  the pension trust was underfunded 
this determination was made in accordance with employer retirement income security act of erisa calculations  with a total actuarial asset value of billion and a total actuarial accrued liability of billion 
under the pension protection act of pension protection act  a funded percentage of should be maintained for this multi employer pension plan  and if the plan is determined to have a funded percentage of less than it will be deemed to be endangered or seriously endangered if the number of years to reach a projected funding deficiency equals seven or less  and if less than  it will be deemed to be in critical status 
the funded percentage certified by the actuary for the pension trust was determined to be approximately under the pension act 
on october   the signatory subsidiaries of consol energy received notice from the trustees of the pension trust stating that the pension plan is considered to be in seriously endangered status for the plan year beginning july  due to the funded percentage and projected funding deficiency 
as required by the pension protection act  the pension trust adopted a funding improvement plan on may  because the nbcwa established our signatory subsidiaries contribution obligations through december   our signatory subsidiaries contributions to the pension trust should not increase during the term of the nbcwa as a consequence of any funding improvement plan adopted by the pension trust to address the plan seriously endangered status 
upon expiration of the nbcwa  our signatory subsidiaries could be required to increase contributions to the pension trust in amounts that could be material to our financial position and results of operations or cash flows 
in the event our subsidiaries were to withdraw from the pension trust  consol energy and its subsidiaries would be liable for a proportionate share of such pension plan unfunded vested benefits  as determined by the plan actuary 
based on the information available from the pension trust administrators  we believe that our portion of the contingent liability represented by the plan unfunded vested benefits  in the case of the withdrawal of our signatory subsidiaries from the plan or in the case of the termination of the plan  would be material to our financial position and results of operations 
as of june  in the event certain of our subsidiaries were to withdraw from the pension trust they would have the option to pay the amount of any withdrawal liability assessed by the pension trust in collective annual installments of approximately to million per year 
in the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from the pension trust and such employer or any member in its controlled group cannot satisfy their obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal  then we  along with the other remaining contributing employers  would be liable for an increase in our proportionate share of the pension trust unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal from the plan or its termination 
if lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to consol energy defined benefit pension plan exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost in a plan year  consol energy would need to make an adjustment to operating results equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum payment in that year  which may result in an adjustment that could reduce operating results 
consol energy defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution for benefits earned up through december  in lieu of annual payments when they retire from consol energy 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans for terminations benefits requires that if the lump sum distributions made for a plan year exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  consol energy would need to recognize for that year results of operations an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year 
this type of adjustment may result in a reduction in operating results 
acquisitions that we have completed  acquisitions that we may undertake in the future  as well as expanding existing company mines  involve a number of risks  any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits and to the extent we plan to engage in joint ventures and divestitures  we do not control the timing of these and they may not provide anticipated benefits 
we have completed several acquisitions and investments in the past including the approximately billion dominion acquisition  which closed on april  we also continually seek to grow our business by adding and developing coal and gas reserves through acquisitions and by expanding the production at existing mines and existing gas operations 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the companies  businesses or properties we acquire  we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition and our profitability may decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
acquisitions  mine expansion and gas operation expansion involve various inherent risks  including uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  and potential profitability of  and identifying the extent of all weaknesses  risks  contingent and other liabilities including environmental liabilities of expansion and acquisition opportunities  the potential loss of key customers  management and employees of an acquired business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an expansion or an acquisition opportunity  the potential revision of assumptions regarding gas reserves as we acquire more knowledge by operating an acquired gas business  problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business  unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the expansion or the acquisition opportunity  and we may have to assume cleanup or reclamation obligations or other unanticipated liabilities in connection with these acquisitions 
from time to time part of our business and financing plans include entering into joint venture arrangements and the divestiture of certain assets 
however  we do not control the timing of divestitures or joint venture arrangements and delays in entering into divestitures or joint venture arrangements may reduce the benefits from them 
in addition  the terms of divestitures and joint venture arrangements may make a substantial portion of the benefits we anticipate receiving from them to be subject to future matters that we do not control 
we have entered into two significant gas joint ventures 
these joint ventures restrict our operational and corporate flexibility  actions taken by our joint venture partners may materially impact our financial position and results of operation  and we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from these joint ventures 
in the second half of consol energy  through its principal gas operations subsidiary  cnx gas company llc cnx gas company  entered into joint venture arrangements with noble energy  inc noble energy and hess ohio developments  llc hess regarding our shale gas assets 
we sold a undivided interest in approximately thousand net acres of marcellus shale oil and gas assets to noble energy and a undivided interest in nearly thousand net utica shale acres in ohio 
the following aspects of these joint ventures could materially impact consol energy the development of these properties is subject to the terms of our joint development agreements with these parties and we no longer have the flexibility to control the development of these properties 
for example  the joint development agreements for each of these joint ventures sets forth required capital expenditure programs that each party must participate in unless the parties mutually agree to change such programs or  in certain limited circumstances in the case of the noble energy joint development agreement  a party elects to exercise a non consent right with respect to an entire year 
if we do not timely meet our financial commitments under the respective joint venture agreements  our rights to participate in such joint ventures will be adversely affected and the other parties to the joint ventures may have a right to acquire a share of our interest in such joint ventures proportionate to  and in satisfaction of  our unmet financial obligations 
in addition  each joint venture party has the right to elect to participate in all acreage and other acquisitions in certain defined areas of mutual interest 
each joint development agreement assigns to each party designated areas over which that party will manage and control operations 
we could incur liability as a result of action taken by one of our joint venture partners 
of the approximately billion we anticipate receiving from noble energy  approximately billion depends upon noble energy paying a portion of our share of drilling and development costs for new wells  which we call carried costs 
we entered into a similar transaction with hess ohio developments  llc hess in which approximately million of the total anticipated consideration of million is dependent upon hess paying carried costs 
thus  the benefits we anticipate receiving in the joint ventures depend in part upon the rate at which new wells are drilled and developed in each joint venture  which could fluctuate significantly from period to period 
moreover  the performance of these third party obligations is outside our control 
the inability or failure of a joint venturer to pay its portion of development costs  including our carried costs during the carry period  could increase our costs of operations or result in reduced drilling and production of oil and gas or loss of rights to develop the oil and gas properties held by that joint venture 
noble energy obligation to pay carried costs is suspended if average henry hub natural gas prices fall and remain below per million british thermal units or mmbtu in any three consecutive month period and will remain suspended until average natural gas prices are above mmbtu for three consecutive months 
as a result of this provision  noble energy obligation to pay carried costs was suspended beginning on december  we cannot predict when this suspension will be lifted and noble energy obligation to pay the carried costs will resume 
this suspension has the effect of requiring us to incur our entire percent share of the drilling and completion costs for new wells during the suspension period and delaying receipt of a portion of the value we expect to receive in the transaction 
the noble energy joint development agreement prohibits prior to march   unless noble energy consents in its sole discretion  any transfer of our interests in the noble energy joint venture assets or our selling or otherwise transferring control of cnx gas company 
the hess joint development agreement prohibits prior to october   unless hess consents in its sole discretion  any transfer of our interests in the hess joint venture assets 
these restrictions may preclude transactions which could be beneficial to our shareholders 
disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses  delay or terminate projects and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business 
under our joint venture agreements with noble energy and hess  each of them has the right to perform due diligence on the title to the oil and gas interests which we conveyed to them and to assert that title to the acreage is defective 
consol energy then can review and respond to the asserted title defects  or cure them  and ultimately  if the claim is not resolved  either party can submit the defect to an arbitrator for resolution 
consol energy also has the right to require the defected acreage to be reassigned in certain circumstances 
we are currently engaged in this title review process with noble and hess 
if they establish any title defects which are not resolved in favor of consol energy or if the subject acreage is reassigned to us at our request  then subject to certain deductibles  noble and hess respective aggregate carried cost obligation under the joint venture agreements will be reduced by the value the parties previously allocated to the affected acreage in the transaction 
if a significant percentage of the oil and gas interests we contributed have title defects  the carried costs could be materially reduced and our aggregate share of the drilling and completion costs for wells in these joint ventures could materially increase 
to date  noble has asserted formal title defects with respect to approximately  gross deal acres  which have an aggregate transaction value of million 
we believe that we will resolve most of those defects favorably to consol energy 
to date  we have conceded defects to noble which have an aggregate value equal to less than the applicable deductibles and the impact of these conceded defects on the company financial statements has not been material 
in the case of our ohio utica shale joint venture with hess  based on title work performed by hess  we believe that there are chain of title issues with respect to approximately  of the joint venture acres  most of which likely cannot be cured 
hess interest in these  acres has an allocated transaction value of approximately million and may result in a corresponding reduction of the associated carried interest 
the loss of these utica shale acres itself will not have a material impact on the company financial statements 
after accounting for these defective acres  there are approximately  acres in our ohio utica shale joint venture with hess 
we may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future which could pose risks similar to risks described above 
consol energy rights plan may have anti takeover effects that may discourage a change of control even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders 
on december   consol energy adopted a rights plan which  in certain circumstances  including a person or group acquiring  or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer that would result in a person or group acquiring  beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of consol energy common stock  would entitle each right holder to receive  upon exercise of the right  shares of consol energy common stock having a value equal to twice the right exercise price 
for example  at an exercise price of per right  each right not otherwise voided would entitle its holders to purchase worth of shares of consol energy common stock for assuming that shares of consol energy common stock had a per share value of at such time  the holder of each right would be entitled to purchase ten shares of consol energy common stock for  or a price of per share  one half of its then market price 
this and other provisions of consol energy rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire consol energy  which could hinder stockholders ability to receive a premium for consol energy stock over the prevailing market prices 
the rights plan will expire on december  the provisions of our debt agreements and the risks associated with our debt could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   our total indebtedness was approximately billion of which approximately billion was under our senior unsecured notes due april  billion was under our senior unsecured notes due april  million was under our senior notes due  million was under our maryland economic development corporation port facilities refunding revenue bonds medco revenue bonds due september  million of capitalized leases due through  million of miscellaneous debt and million due under the accounts receivable securitization facility 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences  including  but not limited to increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development of our coal and gas reserves or other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and in the coal and gas industries  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors 
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our  and senior unsecured notes limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness unless specified tests or exceptions are met 
in addition  our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our  and senior unsecured notes subject us to financial and or other restrictive covenants 
under our senior secured credit agreement  we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio  and a maximum senior secured leverage ratio  as defined 
our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our  and senior unsecured notes impose a number of restrictions upon us  such as restrictions on granting liens on our assets  making investments  paying dividends  selling assets and engaging in acquisitions 
failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have an adverse effect on us 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we may be forced to sell assets  seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations 
our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our  and senior unsecured notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales 
we may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
unless we replace our gas reserves  our gas reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
producing natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
because total estimated proved reserves include our proved undeveloped reserves at december   production is expected to decline even if those proved undeveloped reserves are developed and the wells produce as expected 
the rate of decline will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances 
thus  our future natural gas reserves and production and  therefore  our cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas  we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
as of december   we had hedges on approximately billion cubic feet of our natural gas production  billion cubic feet of our natural gas production  and billion cubic feet of our natural gas production 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges 
if we choose not to engage in  or reduce our use of hedging arrangements in the future  we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas prices than our competitors who engage in hedging arrangements to a greater extent than we do 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  the counterparties to our contracts fail to perform the contracts  or the creditworthiness of our counterparties or their guarantors is substantially impaired 
if our gas hedges would no longer qualify for hedge accounting  we will be required to mark them to market and recognize the adjustments through current year earnings 
this may result in more volatility in our income in future periods 
changes in federal or state income tax laws  particularly in the area of percentage depletion and intangible drilling costs  could cause our financial position and profitability to deteriorate 
the federal government has been reviewing the income tax laws relating to the coal and oil and gas industries regarding among other matters eliminating or changing certain us federal income tax benefits currently available to coal mining and oil and gas exploration and development companies 
among the possible changes are eliminating the percentage depletion allowance and the intangible drilling costs deduction 
it is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon such changes could be effective 
if the percentage depletion allowance or the intangible drilling cost deduction were reduced or eliminated  any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in february  the state legislature of pennsylvania passed a new natural gas impact fee in pennsylvania  where a substantial portion of our acreage in the marcellus shale is located 
the legislation imposes an annual fee on natural gas and oil operators for each well drilled for a period of fifteen years 
the fee is on a sliding scale set by the public utility commission and is based on two factors changes in the consumer price index and the average new york mercantile exchange natural gas prices from the last day of each month 
the estimated total fees per well based on today current natural gas price is thousand over the year period 
the passage of this legislation increases the financial burden on our operations in the marcellus shale

h adjusted ebit is defined as earnings before deducting net interest expense interest expense less interest income  income taxes  loss on debt extinguishment  and abandonment of long lived assets 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before deducting net interest expense interest expense less interest income  income taxes and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
although adjusted ebit and adjusted ebitda are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management believes that they are useful to an investor in evaluating consol energy because they are widely used in the coal industry as measures to evaluate a company operating performance before debt expense and cash flow 
financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebit and adjusted ebitda do not purport to represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition  because adjusted ebit and adjusted ebitda are not calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
management discretionary use of funds depicted by adjusted ebit and adjusted ebitda may be limited by working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  and by restrictions related to legal requirements  commitments and uncertainties 
a reconcilement of adjusted ebit and adjusted ebitda to financial net income is as follows for the years ended december  net income add interest expense less interest income less interest income included in black lung excise tax refund add income tax expense add loss on debt extinguishment add abandonment of long lived assets adjusted earnings before interest and taxes adjusted ebit add depreciation  depletion and amortization adjusted earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  depletion and amortization adjusted ebitda i for purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings represent income before income taxes plus fixed charges

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overall demand for thermal coal decreased in versus levels from a sharp decrease in natural gas prices in early and a corresponding shift towards gas fired generation  warm winter weather  as well as a modest decline in electric generation output 
over the course of  coal fired generation  however  regained domestic share of the power market from rising natural gas prices throughout which increased above the fuel switching breakeven point 
domestically  coal inventories at electric generators were elevated versus historical averages for much of the year 
the hotter than normal summer  declining coal production  and rising thermal exports  all helped to reduce coal inventories in the latter part of the year 
us electric demand during the fourth quarter of is estimated to be slightly higher than levels  as weather returned to more normal patterns 
however  us thermal coal exports enjoyed solid international demand in the first three quarters of but slowed slightly during the fourth quarter 
total thermal coal exports were up from last year as producers sought demand abroad to offset weaker domestic demand noted above 
atlantic market spot coal prices fell throughout the year with an oversupply of us coal hitting the european market 
spot prices began to flatten in the fourth quarter as supply moderated and winter season approached 
longer term fundamentals for us thermal coal exports remain favorable as subsidized mining in europe is phased out  nuclear growth plans are curtailed  and coal continues to maintain a cost advantage over other more expensive oil linked fuels 
global steel demand has been under pressure and as a consequence  metallurgical coal used to make steel is in less demand 
for  metallurgical coal demand slowed as world blast furnace output grew by approximately 
production grew  but demand was below the historical growth rate recorded this past decade 
in particular  asian  european  and south american demand growth all slowed 
we expect global infrastructure development will continue to drive future metallurgical and steel demand growth 
consistent with last year  china continues to provide the bulk of the world blast furnace output with approximately of world production 
while demand growth was slowing  global metallurgical coal production growth remained strong 
global metallurgical coal supply grew in  particularly from rising exports in australia 
international settlement prices declined throughout the year to levels much lower than highs  further underscoring an oversupplied market 
in response to the weak market conditions  consol energy idled its buchanan mine and its amonate complex in early september the buchanan mine resumed production the week of november with a five day work week schedule  while amonate remained idled for the remainder of buchanan typically produces about thousand tons per month 
amonate was expected to produce about thousand tons per month 
also in response to metallurgical and thermal market conditions  buchanan and blacksville no 
were both idled in march and april our focus for will be to increase our target markets and customer base 
also in response to the current weak market conditions for domestic coal and recent proposals and final rules adopted by the epa  consol energy issued a notice under the workers adjustment and retraining notification act warn of a layoff at its fola operations near bickmore  west virginia 
the layoffs were effective on september  regular production from underground operations was idled on september  production from the surface areas was idled as of june   and employees have been reassigned to reclamation activities 
the idling of the fola complex reduced total annual company production by approximately thousand tons 
on december   consol energy issued another warn of its intent to complete the idling of its fola operations 
the layoff is expected to occur during a day period beginning on february  layoffs are expected to affect surface and office employees and employees at the company little eagle deep mine 
there was an over supply of natural gas early in with the warm winter and modest economic environment 
one bright spot for demand was record power generation output  as utilities capitalized on the sharp decline in natural gas prices early in the year 
after several years of rising supply  natural gas production growth moderated with the decline in prices 
the supply and demand imbalance narrowed as the year progressed as power generation rose  supply moderated  and imports of liquefied natural gas lng and western canadian gas declined 
additionally  us exports to eastern canada and mexico have increased to further balance the market 
more normal weather  and a warmer than average july  put upward pressure on natural gas prices 
during the fourth quarter in particular  prices rose on expectations of higher demand before moderating amid mild december temperatures 
longer term rebalancing will be aided by declining conventional production and the large shift in drilling focus for oil and liquids rich gas plays 
as natural gas targeted rigs have fallen throughout the year  oil targeted rigs have sharply increased 
the widespread perception that shale gas production will yield lower and less volatile natural gas prices could spur additional demand as electric generators choose to build additional high efficiency baseload gas power plants 
additional demand will come from the petrochemical industry and developing sources of demand such as increased wide scale use of natural gas vehicles 
the prospect of us natural gas exports through lng facilities is also under consideration 
consol energy continues to believe that its natural gas assets will bring balance to consol energy portfolio of long lived energy resources 
a failure to return to normal weather patterns could have a negative short term impact on consol energy natural gas and domestic thermal coal demand 
for much of  the coal and natural gas industries worked through the effects of last year mild winter temperatures 
a repeat in could exacerbate existing strain 
additionally  uncertainty in the short term economic outlook could lead to a slowing of global economic expansion 
economic uncertainty is currently driven by the european sovereign debt crisis  lingering budget and political uncertainty in the us  increasing retirements of us nuclear units  instability in the middle east oil producing region  and economic and political transitions in asia 
the fundamental long term drivers of consol energy business remain unchanged as the global demand for low cost  reliable sources of energy and metallurgical coal remain strong in both the developed and developing world 
consol energy engaged in several asset sale transactions in the year ended december  in april  consol energy sold its non producing elk creek reserves in southern west virginia 
the transaction resulted in cash proceeds of million and a gain on sale of assets of million 
in february  consol energy sold it non producing burning star reserves in illinois 
the transaction resulted in cash proceeds of million and a gain on sale of assets of million 
in june  consol energy sold its non producing northern powder river basin assets in southern montana and northern wyoming for million in cash to cloud peak energy 
additionally  consol energy retained an production royalty interest on approximately million tons of permitted fee coal 
this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
in june  consol energy expanded an existing mining joint venture with a privately held company in central pennsylvania 
the joint venture will self fund  through retained earnings  a million gross expansion in and the expansion will enable consol energy share of high vol and mid vol forecasted coal production to increase from  tons in to  tons in in december  consol energy sold non producing western canadian coal assets for million 
ram river coal corp  a private ontario company created by forbes manhattan inc f m a private merchant bank headquartered in toronto  canada acquired of consol energy ram river and scurry ram coal properties for aggregate consideration of million million payable to consol energy 
on closing  ram river coal corp 
made an aggregate cash payment of million million payable to consol energy and under the terms of the asset purchase agreement provides for additional payments to consol energy of million on or before june  and million on or before june  the transaction resulted in an after tax gain of million 
in december  consol energy agreed to sell its interest in other coal assets  subject to certain conditions  in alberta  for million 
the buyer is riversdale resources  headquartered in sydney  australia 
the primary asset is grassy mountain surface mine 
the sale is anticipated to close during the second quarter of  and as such  no gain has been recognized as of december  consol energy continues to explore potential sales of assets 
consol energy engaged in several other transactions in the year ended december  these transactions include the following in november  consol energy offered a voluntary severance incentive program vsip to active salaried corporate and operation support employees with years of service  or more 
under this program  eligible employees who accepted the offer will receive a severance payment equal to one year salary and the accrued vacation earned as of december  approximately employees volunteered for the program 
severance and vacation pay was approximately million and was recognized in other accrued liabilities at december  these enhanced benefits were paid in january on july  a structural failure occurred at consol energy newly installed above ground conveyor system at the bailey preparation plant in southwestern pennsylvania 
the belt system conveys coal from the bailey and enlow fork mines to the bailey preparation plant 
this incident caused a total of four longwalls to be idled for approximately three weeks  at which point one rebuilt conveyor belt was re started 
production from these mines was at approximately of normal for most of the remainder of the third quarter 
the company net income would have been an estimated million higher  had the conveyor belt incident not occurred 
this impact is before the receipt of any insurance proceeds and any other proceeds under the indemnity provisions of the construction contract 
consol energy has received million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to this incident  included in its results of operations 
although consol energy insurance claim is higher than the proceeds received to date  there is no guarantee that additional monies will be received 
in june  consol energy announced that it acquired a non controlling interest in epiphany solar water systems  a privately held company founded in new castle  pa in epiphany solar water systems is testing what is believed to be the world first concentrated solar powered water purification system 
under the agreement  consol energy has made an initial investment of million and one of its marcellus gas well locations in greene county served as the site to pilot test this solar powered water purification system 
initial testing of the epiphany unit demonstrated the efficacy of the approach 
based on results of the pilot test  system improvements and upgrades are being implemented 
additional testing is ongoing and will be used to evaluate system enhancements in the coming months 
in april  consol energy announced certain changes to the salaried other post retirement benefit plan that current retirees and current active employees will receive as of january  the change provides a fixed annual retiree medical contribution into a health reimbursement account for eligible employees 
the money in the account can be used to help pay for a commercial medical plan  medicare part b and part d premiums and other qualified expenses 
employees who work or worked in corporate or operational support positions at retirement and who are age or older at december  will receive the revised benefit in lieu of the current retiree medical and prescription drug coverage 
employees who work or worked in corporate or operations support positions who are under age at december  will receive no retiree medical or prescription drug benefit 
consol energy remeasured the salaried other postretirement plan as of march  to recognize these changes 
the remeasurement reflects the reduction in benefits and the change in discount rate from at december  to at march  the remeasurement resulted in a reduction of approximately million of other post retirement benefits opeb liability with a corresponding offset to other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred taxes 
the change resulted in a million reduction in opeb expense compared to what was originally expected to be recognized for the year ended december  the change was made to align consol energy corporate and operational support compensation package more closely with our peer group 
pennsylvania enacted act of  which provides for the comprehensive regulation of marcellus shale development in pennsylvania 
among other things  act requires an impact fee be paid annually on all nonconventional gas wells drilled in the state 
the annual fee is based on annual average sales price and is modified annually for a year period for each well 
the impact fee also required the first year fee be paid on all applicable wells drilled before january  with subsequent annual fees to apply each year thereafter 
consol energy retroactive impact fee related to wells drilled prior to january  was approximately million 
this amount was paid in september on december   consol energy board of directors accelerated the declaration and payment of the regular quarterly dividend of per share  payable on december   to shareholders of record on december  consol energy is managing several significant matters that may affect our business and impact our financial results in the future including the following challenges in the overall environment in which we operate create increased risks that we must continuously monitor and manage 
these risks include i increased prices for commodities such as diesel fuel  synthetic rubber and steel that we use in our operations although prices for some of these commodities declined during the year from previous years  ii increased scrutiny of existing safety regulations and the development of new safety regulations and iii additional environmental restrictions 
federal and state environmental regulators are reviewing our operations more closely and are more strictly interpreting and enforcing existing environmental laws and regulations  resulting in increased costs and delays 
for example  we entered into a consent decree with the epa and the west virginia department of environmental protection pursuant to which we agreed to construct an advanced technology mine water treatment plant and related facilities to reduce high levels of chlorides in water discharges from certain of our mines in northern west virginia  at a total estimated cost of approximately million 
the new facility must be placed into service no later than may federal and state regulators have proposed regulations which  if adopted  would adversely impact our business 
these proposed regulations could require significant changes in the manner in which we operate and or would increase the cost of our operations 
for example  the department of interior  office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement osm is currently preparing an environmental impact statement relating to osm consideration of five alternatives for amending its coal mining stream protection rules 
all of the alternatives  except the no action alternative  could make it more costly to mine our coal and or could eliminate the ability to mine some of our coal 
other examples are the mercury and air toxic standards mats remanded by the court and reproposed by the epa in november and the utility maximum achievable control technology utility macts rules issued by the epa 
these new regulations set mercury and air toxic standards for new and existing coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units and include more stringent new source performance standards nsps for particulate matter pm  so and nox 
although the epa intends to reconsider certain aspects of these new rules  some older coal fired power plants may be retired or have operation time reduced rather than install additional expensive emission controls which could reduce the amount of coal consumed 
on april   the epa published new final new source performance standards for gas wells and related facilities 
these rules apply to wells that were hydraulically fractured after august  and require the implementation by january  of technologies that capture the gas that is currently vented or flared during completion hydrofracturing of a well 
low pressure wells  including coalbed methane wells  are excluded from these new standards 
in april  the epa published its proposed new source performance standards nsps for carbon dioxide emissions from coal powered electric generating units 
the proposed rules will apply to new power plants and to existing plants that make major modifications 
if the rules are adopted as proposed  the only new coal fired power plants that will be able to meet the proposed emission limits will be coal fired plants with carbon dioxide capture and storage ccs 
commercial scale ccs is not likely to be available in the near future  and if available  it may make coal fired electric generation units uneconomical compared to new gas fired electric generation units 
thus  if finalized the proposed rules could seriously threaten the construction of new coal fired electric generating units 
in may  consol energy received a citizens notice of intent to sue from the sierra club  the ohio valley environmental coalition and the west virginia highlands conservancy alleging violations of the clean water act relating to selenium at its fola mining complex in central west virginia 
on june   the west virginia department of environmental protection issued an administrative order to fola 
fola is complying with the administrative order 
on september   the citizens group filed a complaint against fola in the u 
s district court for the southern district of west virginia covering the same matters addressed in the state administrative order 
in late june  consol energy received informal notification from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection of the department intent pursuant to a technical guidance document entitled surface water protection underground bituminous coal mining to require a change in the mine plan of a pending application for a permit for expansion of the company bailey longwall mine 
if ultimately required  this change in mine plan could have a material effect on consol energy forecasted production for although consol energy does not agree that a modification of its mining plan is necessary to comply with applicable regulatory performance standards  consol energy is currently reviewing the notification and any modifications that would be required if consol energy is compelled to modify its application 
under our joint venture agreements with noble energy and hess  each of them has the right to perform due diligence on the title to the oil and gas interests which we conveyed to them and to assert that title to the acreage is defective 
if they establish any title defects which are not resolved in favor of consol energy or if the subject acreage is reassigned to us at our request  then subject to certain deductibles  noble and hess respective aggregate carried cost obligation under the joint venture agreements will be reduced by the value the parties previously allocated to the affected acreage in the transaction 
if a significant percentage of the oil and gas interests we contributed have title defects  the carried costs could be materially reduced and our aggregate share of the drilling and completion costs for wells in these joint ventures could materially increase 
to date  noble has asserted formal title defects with respect to approximately  gross deal acres  which have an aggregate transaction value of million 
we believe that we will resolve most of those defects favorably to consol energy 
to date  we have conceded defects to noble which have an aggregate value equal to less than the applicable deductibles and the impact of these conceded defects on the company financial statements has not been material 
in the case of our ohio utica shale joint venture with hess  based on title work performed by hess  we believe that there are chain of title issues with respect to approximately  of the joint venture acres  most of which likely cannot be cured 
hess interest in these  acres has an allocated transaction value of approximately million and may result in a corresponding reduction of the associated carried interest 
the loss of these utica shale acres itself will not have a material impact on the company financial statements 
after accounting for these defective acres  there are approximately  acres in our ohio utica shale joint venture with hess 
a pension settlement charge is reasonably possible to occur in when lump sum payments from the pension plan exceed the service and interest expense  pension settlement accounting requires unamortized actuarial gains and loss related to the lump sum payouts be amortized immediately 
the threshold for pension settlement recognition is million 
if the threshold for pension settlement is reached  the pension settlement charge could be material to the financial results of consol energy 
also  pension settlement would require the pension plan to be remeasured using updated assumptions 
the updated assumptions would include resetting the discount rate used in the actuarial calculation 
consol is also in negotiations with the authority that operates the pittsburgh international airport for the lease of the oil and gas rights on approximately  acres surrounding the airport 
these are contiguous acres which are in the liquids area of the marcellus shale play 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders consol energy reported net income attributable to consol energy shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the coal division includes thermal coal  high volatile metallurgical coal  low volatile metallurgical coal and other coal 
the total coal division contributed million of earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the total coal division sold million tons of coal produced from consol energy mines  excluding our portion of tons sold from equity affiliates  for the year ended december  compared to million tons for the year ended december  the average sales price and average cost of goods sold per ton for all active coal operations were as follows for the years ended december  variance percent change average sales price per ton sold average costs of goods sold per ton margin the lower average sales price per ton sold reflects a decrease in the global metallurgical coal markets  slightly offset by higher thermal coal average prices as a result of several successful renegotiations of domestic thermal contracts where pricing took effect january  the coal division priced million tons on the export market at an average sales price of per ton for the year ended december  compared to million tons at an average price of per ton for the year ended december  all other tons were sold on the domestic market 
the decreased sales tonnage is primarily due to decreased coal demand in both thermal and metallurgical markets and curtailed shipments due to the bailey belt incident discussed previously 
average costs per ton sold increased per ton in the period to period comparison due primarily to the following average cost of goods sold per ton increased due to fewer tons sold 
fixed costs are allocated over fewer sales tons  resulting in higher unit costs 
the idle longwalls at the blacksville mine and the buchanan mine during march and april resulted in an increase in unit costs of approximately per ton as the fixed costs were allocated over fewer tons 
average depreciation  depletion and amortization increased due to additional assets placed into service after the period 
average operating supplies and maintenance costs per ton increased due to additional equipment maintenance  timing of major equipment overhaul costs  increased fuel and lubricants and use of pumpable cribs for roof support 
average labor and labor related expenses increased primarily as result of the impact of the umwa contract wage increases  offset  in part  by lower overtime hours worked 
average retirement and disability cost per ton decreased due to the improvement in other postretirement benefits discussed in the long term liabilities section below 
the total gas division includes coalbed methane cbm  shallow oil and gas  marcellus and other gas 
the total gas division contributed million of earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total gas production was billion net cubic feet for the year ended december  compared to billion net cubic feet for the year ended december  total gas production increased primarily due to the on going drilling program  partially offset by billion net cubic feet of production related to both the divestiture of antero resources appalachian corp 
antero and the noble joint venture 
production also decreased due to the buchanan mine idling as previously discussed 
the average sales price and average costs for all active gas operations were as follows for the years ended december  variance percent change average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold average costs per thousand cubic feet sold margin total gas division outside sales revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold  offset  in part  by the increase in volumes sold 
the decrease in average sales price is the result of the decline in general market prices  partially offset by various gas swap transactions that occurred throughout both periods 
the gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these financial hedges represented billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
changes in the average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold were primarily related to the following items higher volumes in the period to period comparison due to the on going drilling program  offset  in part  by billion cubic feet divested in the noble and the antero transactions resulted in lower average costs per thousand cubic feet sold 
fixed costs are allocated over increased volumes  resulting in lower unit costs 
lower units of production depreciation  depletion and amortization rates for producing properties 
these rates were generally calculated using the net book value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserve additions 
increased proved and proved developed reserves relative to the net book value of the producing assets as compared with the prior year resulted in a lower units of production rate 
lower direct administrative  selling and other costs per thousand cubic feet sold due to increased sales volumes and decreased actual dollars as a result of lower direct administrative labor and other costs 
gathering costs increased in the period to period comparison due to higher transportation charges 
the other segment includes industrial supplies activity  terminal  river and dock service activity  income taxes and other business activities not assigned to the coal or gas segment 
at the beginning of  management decided that it would no longer consider general and administrative costs on a segment by segment basis as a factor in their decision making process 
these decisions include allocation of capital and individual segment profit performance results 
management did conclude that general and administrative costs would continue to be considered in results at the divisional level total coal and total gas 
in order to present financial information in a manner consistent with internal management evaluations  the prior period general and administrative costs have been reclassified to reflect information consistent with the current year presentation 
the total divisional results have not changed 
individual segment results within the division have been recast to reflect costs excluding general and administrative 
general and administrative costs are excluded from the coal and gas unit costs above 
as in the prior periods  general and administrative costs are allocated between divisions coal  gas  other based primarily on percentage of total revenue and percentage of total projected capital expenditures 
the total general and administrative costs were made up of the following items for the years ended december  variance percent change employee wages and related expenses consulting and professional services contributions miscellaneous total company general and administrative expenses total company general and administrative expenses changed due to the following employee wages and related expenses decreased million primarily attributable to lower salary opeb expenses in the period to period comparison 
the lower expenses relate to changes in the discount rates and other assumptions  and a modification to the benefit plan for certain salaried employees 
consulting and professional services decreased million in the period to period comparison due to a reduction in consol energy advertising and promotion campaign 
contributions increased million in the period to period comparison due to various transactions  none of which were individually material 
miscellaneous general and administrative expenses decreased million in the period to period comparison due to various transactions throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
total company long term liabilities  such as opeb  the salary retirement plan  workers compensation and long term disability are actuarially calculated for the company as a whole 
the expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars 
total consol energy expense related to our actuarial calculated liabilities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate assumptions used to calculate expense for benefit plans at the measurement date  which is december additionally  a part of the decrease was due to a plan modification for the salaried opeb plan which required a remeasurement at march  see note pension and other postretirement benefit plans and note coal workers pneumoconiosis cwp and workers compensation in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional details related to total company expense increases

the higher average thermal coal sales price in the period was the result of the successful renegotiations of several domestic thermal contracts during the thermal coal segment was also impacted by million tons of thermal coal sold on the high volatile metallurgical coal market for the year ended december   which was million tons less than the tons sold in the year ended december  other income attributable to the thermal coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliates that operate thermal coal mines 
the equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity 
total costs of goods sold are comprised of changes in thermal coal inventory  both volumes and carrying values  and costs of tons produced in the period 
total cost of goods sold for thermal coal was  million for the year ended december   or million lower than the  million for the year ended december  although total cost of goods sold dollars were improved  total costs per ton sold on a unit basis were impaired 
total cost of goods sold for thermal coal was per ton in the year ended december  compared to per ton in the year ended december  average cost of goods sold per ton was impacted by the idling of the blacksville mine longwall during march and april the mine continued to run the continuous miners and complete mine maintenance throughout march and april which negatively impacted year to date unit costs by per ton

direct operating costs were per ton produced in the current year compared to per ton produced in the prior year 
changes in the average direct operating costs per low volatile ton produced were primarily related to the following items the buchanan longwall was idled during the months of march and april which resulted in per ton higher direct operating costs produced 
the mine continued to run the continuous miners and perform mine maintenance during the month when the longwall was idled 
this negatively impacted unit costs 
low volatile metallurgical coal production was million tons for the year ended december  compared to million tons for the year ended december  production was significantly lower in the year to year comparison due to the buchanan mine being idled in early september the mine was idled in response to weak market demand for low volatile metallurgical coal 
production resumed in early november with a five day work week instead of the normal seven day work week 
fixed costs were then spread over fewer tons produced which increased all costs on a per unit basis 
buchanan mine was also idled in march and april which impacted production 
royalties and production taxes improved million to million in the current year to date period compared to million in the prior year to date period 
unit costs also improved per low volatile metallurgical ton produced to per ton in the current year to date period compared to per ton in the prior year to date period

these financial hedges represented billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
total gas unit costs decreased slightly for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to lower depreciation  depletion and amortization and lower gathering costs partially offset by increased lifting costs 
the wells purchased in the dominion acquisition increased total operating costs by per thousand cubic feet due to higher costs and lower volumes produced related to the age of these wells compared to the legacy consol energy wells 
excluding the impact of these purchased wells  unit costs improved per thousand cubic feet primarily due to the additional volumes produced  improved depreciation  depletion and amortization and lower gathering charges 
volumes increased in the period to period comparison due to the on going drilling program and the additional volumes from the wells purchased in the dominion acquisition partially offset by the impact of the noble joint venture 
lower depreciation  depletion and amortization rates were the result of additional gas reserves recognized at december  gathering and compression charges were improved primarily due to a fuel surcharge reduction by a utility provider 
lifting costs increased in the period to period comparison due to additional well services to maintain production levels 
the other segment includes industrial supplies activity  terminal  river and dock service activity  income taxes and other business activities not assigned to the coal or gas segment 
at the beginning of  management decided that it would no longer consider general and administrative costs on a segment by segment basis as a factor in their decision making process 
these decisions include allocation of capital and individual segment profit performance results 
management did conclude that general and administrative costs would continue to be considered in results at the divisional level total coal and total gas 
in order to present financial information in a manner consistent with internal management evaluations  the prior periods general and administrative costs have been reclassified to reflect information consistent with the current year presentation 
the total divisional results have not changed 
individual segment results within the division have been recast to reflect costs excluding general and administrative 
general and administrative costs are excluded from the coal and gas unit costs above 
as in the prior periods  general and administrative costs are allocated between divisions coal  gas  other based primarily on percentage of total revenue and percentage of total projected capital expenditures 
the total company general and administrative costs were made up of the following items for the years ended december  variance percent change employee wages and related expenses contributions consulting and professional services miscellaneous total company general and administrative expenses total company general and administrative expenses increased due to the following employee wages and related expenses increased million which was primarily attributable to the support staff retained in the dominion acquisition and additional hiring of support staff in the period to period comparison

the equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity 
total cost of goods sold are comprised of changes in thermal coal inventory  both volumes and carrying values  and cost of tons produced in the period 
total cost of goods for thermal coal was  million for the year ended december   or million higher than the  million for the year ended december  total costs of goods sold for thermal coal was per ton in the year ended december  compared to per ton in the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold per thermal ton produced were due to the items described below 
direct operating costs are comprised of labor  supplies  maintenance  power and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal 
these costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management 
direct operating costs related to the thermal coal segment were  million in the year ended december  compared to  million in the year ended december  direct operating costs were per ton produced in the current period compared to per ton produced in the prior year period 
changes in the average direct operating costs per thermal ton produced were primarily related to the following items average operating supplies and maintenance costs per thermal ton produced increased due to additional maintenance and equipment overhaul costs  additional roof control costs  and increased fuel and lubricants 
additional maintenance and equipment overhaul costs are related to additional equipment being serviced in the current period 
additional roof control costs resulted from changes in roof support strategy  such as using longer roof bolts and additional types of roof support  in order to improve the safety of our mines and to provide a more reliable source of production for our customers 
increased fuel and lubricant costs are related to higher fuel prices in the current period 
labor and related benefits were impaired on a cost per thermal ton sold basis due to higher costs and lower volumes sold 
higher benefit costs were due primarily to contributions made to the pension trust the trust  which is a multiemployer pension plan 
contributions to the trust were negotiated under the national bituminous coal wage agreement and are based on a rate per hour worked by members of the united mine workers of america umwa 
the contribution rate increased per hour worked in the period compared to the period 
non represented benefit rates for active employees also increased as a result of continued increases in healthcare costs 
labor and related benefits also increased due to additional employees and the impact of the wage increases of per hour worked  per hour worked effective january  under the previous collective bargaining agreement and per hour worked effective july  related to the july collective bargaining agreement 
these increases were offset  in part  as a result of the tax relief and health care act of authorizing general fund revenues and expanding transfers of interest from the abandoned mine land trust fund to cover orphan retirees which remain in the combined fund  the benefit plan and the plan 
the additional federal funding eliminated the funding of orphan retirees by participating active employers of the plans  resulting in lower expense in the period to period comparison 
the additional federal funding does not impact the amount of contributions required to be paid for our assigned retirees 
also  we may be required to make additional payments in the future to these plans in the event the federal contributions are not sufficient to cover the benefits 
average operating costs per thermal ton sold increased due to lower tons sold resulting in fixed costs being allocated over less tons resulting in higher unit costs 
royalties and production taxes increased million to million in the current year to date period 
the impairment was primarily due to the higher average sales price 
thermal coal royalties and production taxes were per ton in the current year to date period compared to per ton in the prior year to date period 
average cost per thermal ton produced increased due to an increase in the tons mined on leased versus owned properties in the year to date period to period comparison 
direct services to the operations are comprised of items which support groups manage on behalf of the coal operations 
costs included in direct services are comprised of subsidence costs  direct administrative and selling costs  permitting and compliance costs  mine closing and reclamation costs  and water treatment costs 
the cost of these support services were million in the current year to date period compared to million in the prior year to date period 
direct services to the operations were per ton in the current period compared to per ton in the prior year to date period 
changes in the average direct service to operations cost per thermal ton produced were primarily related to the following items average direct service costs to operations were impaired due to lower tons produced in the period to period comparison which negatively impacted unit costs 
permitting and compliance costs have increased due to increased stream monitoring expenses  increased compliance work related to ponds and ditches  and additional permits for water discharge pipelines 
unit costs were also impaired due to various other items  none of which were individually material 
retirement and disability costs are comprised of the expenses related to the company long term liabilities  such as other post retirement benefits opeb  the salary retirement plan  workers compensation  coal workers pneumoconiosis cwp and long term disability 
these liabilities are actuarially calculated for the company as a whole 
the expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars 
the retirement and disability costs attributable to the thermal coal segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the thermal coal retirement and disability costs was primarily attributable to the total company increase in long term liability expense discussed in the total company results of operations section 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the thermal coal segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to additional equipment and infrastructure placed into service after the period that was depreciated on a straight line basis

contract buyout represents the cancellation of a drilling arrangement with a third party well driller 
bank fees were higher in the period to period comparison due to amending and extending the revolving credit facility related to the gas segment 
in april  the facility was amended to allow billion of borrowings and was extended to april  stock based compensation was higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the increased allocation from consol energy as a result of the dominion acquisition as well as an increase in total consol energy stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation costs are allocated to the gas segment based on revenue and capital expenditure projections between coal and gas 
the short term incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when cnx gas reaches predetermined targets for safety  production and unit costs 
short term incentive compensation increased in the period to period comparison as the result of exceeding the targets in the period  increased number of employees  and an increased allocation of expense from consol energy as the result of exceeding corporate targets 
variable interest earnings are related to various adjustments a third party entity has reflected in its financial statements 
consol energy holds no ownership interest and during the period de consolidated the impact of this third party due to the cancellation of the drilling arrangement 
based on analysis  during the time consol energy guaranteed the bank loans the entity held  it was determined that consol energy was the primary beneficiary 
therefore  the entity was fully consolidated and the earnings impact was fully reversed in the non controlling interest line discussed below 
legal fees for the period were related to the special committee formed during the cnx gas take in transaction and also represent legal fees related to the shareholder litigation related to this transaction 
other corporate related expense remained consistent in the period to period comparison 
interest expense related to the other gas segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest was incurred by the other gas segment on the cnx gas revolving credit facility  a capital lease and debt held by a variable interest entity 
the million increase was primarily due to higher levels of borrowings on the revolving credit facility in the period to period comparison 
noncontrolling interest represents of the earnings impact of a third party which has been determined to be a variable interest entity  in which consol energy held no ownership interest  but was the primary beneficiary 
the consol energy gas division was determined to be the primary beneficiary due to guarantees of the third party bank debt related to their purchase of drilling rigs 
the third party entity provides drilling services primarily to the consol energy gas division 
consol energy consolidates the entity and then reflects of the impact as noncontrolling interest 
the consolidation did not significantly impact any amounts reflected in the gas division income statement 
the variance in the noncontrolling amounts reflects the third party variance in earnings in the period to period comparison 
in the year ended december   the drilling services contract was bought out 
subsequent to this transaction  the noncontrolling interest was de consolidated 
other segment analysis for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the other segment includes activity from the sales of industrial supplies  the transportation operations and various other corporate activities that are not allocated to the coal or gas segment 
the other segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  the other segment also includes total company income tax expense of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  variance percent change sales outside other income total revenue cost of goods sold and other charges depreciation  depletion amortization taxes other than income tax interest expense total costs loss before income tax income tax net loss industrial supplies total revenue from industrial supplies was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was related to higher sales volumes 
total costs related to industrial supply sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily related to higher sales volumes and changes in last in  first out inventory valuations 
transportation operations total revenue from transportation operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to additional through put tons at the baltimore terminal in the period to period comparison 
total costs related to the transportation operations were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was related to the additional through put tons handled by the operations and additional repairs and maintenance costs to maintain the baltimore terminal facilities 
miscellaneous other additional other income of million was recognized for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to million related to the successful resolution of an outstanding tax issue with the canadian revenue authority for the years through in which consol energy was entitled to interest on a tax refund  million lower equity in earnings of affiliates in the current period compared to the prior year period and million related to various transactions that have occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
other corporate costs in the other segment include interest expense  transaction and financing fees and various other miscellaneous corporate charges 
total other costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  other corporate costs increased due to the following items for the years ended december  variance interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt evaluation fees for non core asset dispositions bank fees transaction and financing fees other interest expense increased million primarily due to interest expense on the long term bonds that were issued in conjunction with the dominion acquisition in april on april   consol energy redeemed all of its outstanding million  senior secured notes due march  in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing these notes 
the redemption price included principal of million  a make whole premium of million and accrued interest of million for a total redemption cost of million 
the loss on extinguishment of debt was million  which primarily represented the interest that would have been paid on these notes if held to maturity 
evaluation fees for non core asset dispositions increased million in the period to period comparison due to various corporate initiatives that began in the period 
bank fees increased million in the period to period comparison due to the refinancing and extension of the previous billion credit facility to billion on april  transaction and financing fees of million were incurred in the year ended december  related to the solicitation of consents of the long term bonds needed in order to clarify the indentures that relate to joint arrangements with respect to consol energy oil and gas properties 
transaction and financing fees of million were incurred in the year ended december  primarily related to the dominion acquisition  as well as the equity and debt issuance that raised approximately billion 
various other corporate expenses were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease of million was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to various discrete transactions that occurred in both periods 
the discrete transactions included an internal revenue service audit settlement for years and and the corresponding impacts to the previously accrued tax positions which resulted in higher percentage depletion deductions 
discrete transactions also included the reversal of a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards and future temporary deductions as well as the reversal of certain uncertain tax positions

for the years ended december  variance percent change total company earnings before income tax income tax expense effective income tax rate critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements 
see note significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
other post employment benefits opeb certain subsidiaries of consol energy provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees not covered by the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the medical plans contain certain cost sharing and containment features  such as deductibles  coinsurance  health care networks and coordination with medicare 
for salaried or non represented hourly employees hired before january   the eligibility requirement is either age with years of service or age with years of service 
also  salaried employees and retirees contribute a target of of the medical plan operating costs 
contributions may be higher  dependent on either years of service or a combination of age and years of service at retirement 
prospective annual cost increases of up to will be shared by consol energy and the participants based on their age and years of service at retirement 
annual cost increases in excess of will be the responsibility of the participants 
in addition  any salaried or non represented hourly employees that were hired or rehired effective january  or later and do not work in a corporate or operational support position are not eligible for retiree health benefits 
in lieu of traditional retiree health coverage  if certain eligibility requirements are met  these employees will receive a retiree medical spending allowance of  per year for each year of service at retirement 
newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the united mine workers of america umwa  hired after january   are not eligible to receive retiree benefits 
in lieu of these benefits  these employees receive a defined contribution benefit of per each hour worked through december   increasing to per hour worked effective january  through december  on march   the salaried opeb plan was amended to reduce medical and prescription drug benefits as of january  the plan amendment calls for a fixed annual retiree medical contribution into a health reimbursement account for eligible employees 
the amount of the contribution will be dependent on several factors  and the money in the account can be used to help pay for a commercial medical plan  medicare part b or part d premiums  and other qualified medical expenses 
employees who work or worked in corporate or operational support positions at retirement and who are age or older at december  will receive the revised benefit in lieu of the current retiree medical and prescription drug benefits described above upon meeting the eligibility requirements at retirement 
employees who work or worked in corporate or operational support positions who are under age at december  will receive no retiree medical or prescription drug benefits 
the opeb plan was remeasured on march  to reflect the reduction in benefits and the change in discount rate to from reflected at the december  measurement date 
the remeasurement resulted in an  reduction in the opeb liability with a corresponding adjustment of  in other comprehensive income  net of  in deferred taxes 
the change resulted in a million reduction in expense compared to what was originally expected to be recognized for the year ended december  as of december   we conducted our annual review of the various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs  average remaining service period  average remaining life expectancy  per capita costs and participation level in each future year used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans 
expected trends in future health care cost assumptions were adjusted from prior year to reflect recent experience and future expectations 
the initial expected trend in health care costs at this year measurement date was with an ultimate trend rate of expected to be reached in the initial expected trend rate at last year measurement date was with an ultimate trend rate of expected to be reached in a decrease in the health care trend rate would have decreased interest and service cost for by approximately million 
a increase in the health care trend rate would have increased the interest and service cost by approximately million 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date  or subsequent remeasurement date  if applicable 
the discount rate is determined using a company specific yield curve model above mean developed with assistance of an external actuary 
the discount rate yield curve was updated to expand the high quality bond universe to address the significant decline in the number of bonds referenced in the establishment of the yield curve in the year time period 
the company specific yield curve model above mean uses a subset of the expanded bond universe to determine the company specific discount rate 
bonds used in the yield curve are rated aa by moody or standard poor as of the measurement date 
the yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows  and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company plans obligations 
at december  and march  remeasurement date discussed above  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years 
changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary and non represented employees to their assumed retirement age 
at december   the average remaining service period is approximately years for our non represented plans 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired umwa population 
the average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization purposes because the majority of the umwa population of our plan is retired 
at december   the average remaining life expectancy of our retired umwa population used to calculate the following year expense is approximately years 
the weighted average per capita costs used to value the december  opeb liability was approximately less than previously expected based on our trend assumption 
if the actual change in per capita cost of medical services or other postretirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates  the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted  which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recorded in the financial statements 
significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on consol energy operating cash flow 
however  the effect on consol energy cash flow from operations for salaried employees is limited to approximately of the previous year medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan 
the estimated liability recognized in the december  financial statements was billion 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately million for other postretirement benefits  all of which were paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  consol energy does not expect to contribute to the other postretirement plan in we intend to pay benefit claims as they are due 
salaried pensions consol energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer plans 
the benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employee pay near retirement 
consol energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions of benefits earned up until december   at the employees election 
the restoration plan was frozen effective december  and was replaced prospectively with the consol energy supplemental retirement plan 
consol energy restoration plan allows only for lump sum distributions earned up until december  effective september   the supplemental retirement plan was amended to include employees of cnx gas 
the supplemental retirement plan was frozen effective december  for certain employees and was replaced prospectively with the consol energy defined contribution restoration plan 
our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation  mortality rates  retirement age and interest rates 
for the year ended december   compensation increases are assumed to range from to depending on age and job classification 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date  or subsequent remeasurement date  if applicable 
the discount rate is determined using a company specific yield curve model above mean developed with assistance of an external actuary 
the discount rate yield curve was updated to expand the high quality bond universe to address the significant decline in the number of bonds referenced in the establishment of the yield curve in the year time period 
the company specific yield curve model above mean uses a subset of the expanded bond universe to determine the company specific discount rate 
bonds used in the yield curve are rated aa by moody or standard poor as of the measurement date 
the yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows  and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company plans 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations 
at december  the average remaining service period is approximately years 
changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets also impacted consol energy pension liability at december  previously  the rate of return on plan assets was 
as of december  this assumption was lowered to 
a reduction of would have increased expense by million 
the market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of december  and multiplying it by the average month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets 
consol energy pension plan weighted average asset allocations at december  consisted of equity securities and debt securities 
as a result of anticipated lump sum settlements in including those associated with the vsip  a pension settlement charge is reasonably possible to occur in when lump sum payments from the pension plan exceed the service and interest expense  pension settlement accounting requires unamortized actuarial gains and loss related to the lump sum payouts be amortized immediately 
the threshold for pension settlement recognition is million 
if the threshold for pension settlement is reached  the pension settlement charge could be material to the financial results of consol energy 
also  pension settlement would require the pension plan to be remeasured using updated assumptions  which would include resetting the discount rate used in the actuarial calculation 
the estimated liability recognized in the december  financial statements was million 
for the year ended december   we contributed approximately million to defined benefit retirement plans other than multi employer plans and to other pension benefits 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are partially funded at december  consol energy intends to contribute an amount that will avoid benefit restrictions for the following plan year 
workers compensation and coal workers pneumoconiosis workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation 
workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment 
consol energy records an actuarially calculated liability  which is determined using various assumptions  including discount rate  future healthcare cost trends  benefit duration and recurrence of injuries 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date  or subsequent remeasurement date  if applicable 
the discount rate is determined using a company specific yield curve model above mean developed with assistance of an external actuary 
the discount rate yield curve was updated to expand the high quality bond universe to address the significant decline in the number of bonds referenced in the establishment of the yield curve in the year time period 
the company specific yield curve model above mean uses a subset of the expanded bond universe to determine the company specific discount rate 
bonds used in the yield curve are rated aa by moody or standard poor as of the measurement date 
the yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows  and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company plans obligations 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased the workers compensation expense cost by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased the workers compensation expense by million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rates  several years of favorable claims experience  various favorable state legislation changes and an overall lower incident rate than our assumptions 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active employees that are eligible to file a future workers compensation claim 
at december   the average remaining service period is approximately years 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was approximately million 
consol energy policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow 
for the year ended december   we made payments for workers compensation benefits and other related fees of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  consol energy is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease 
consol energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits 
after our review  our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and discount rates 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date  or subsequent remeasurement date  if applicable 
the discount rate is determined using a company specific yield curve model above mean developed with assistance of an external actuary 
the discount rate yield curve was updated to expand the high quality bond universe to address the significant decline in the number of bonds referenced in the establishment of the yield curve in the year time period 
the company specific yield curve model above mean uses a subset of the expanded bond universe to determine the company specific discount rate 
bonds used in the yield curve are rated aa by moody or standard poor as of the measurement date 
the yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows  and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company plans obligations 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have increased coal workers pneumoconiosis benefit by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have decreased coal workers pneumoconiosis benefit by million 
actuarial gains associated with coal workers pneumoconiosis have resulted from numerous legislative changes over many years which have resulted in lower approval rates for filed claims than our assumptions originally reflected 
actuarial gains have also resulted from lower incident rates and lower severity of claims filed than our assumptions originally reflected 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active employees 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was million 
for the year ended december   we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  reclamation  mine closure and gas well closing obligations the surface mining control and reclamation act established operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation  mine closing liabilities  and gas well closing which are based upon permit requirements and consol energy engineering expertise related to these requirements  including the current portion  were approximately million at december  this liability is reviewed annually  or when events and circumstances indicate an adjustment is necessary  by consol energy management and engineers 
the estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities 
the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
accounting for asset retirement obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   consol energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
deferred tax valuation allowances remained consistent for the years ended december  and consol energy continues to report deferred tax asset of approximately million relating to its state net operating loss carry forwards subject to a full valuation allowance 
a review of positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits  primarily the history of financial and tax losses on a separate company basis  concluded that a full valuation allowance was warranted 
the net operating loss carry forwards expire at various times from to a valuation allowance of million continues to be recognized against the state deferred tax asset attributable to future tax deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of financial and tax losses 
management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets attributable to state net operating loss carry forwards and future tax deductible differences based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies  and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets in future periods that could materially impact net income 
consol energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
for positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria  an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined 
a previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained 
the evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment  historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates  that are not readily apparent from other sources  form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax liability 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
estimates of our uncertain tax liabilities  including interest and the current portion  were approximately million at december  stock based compensation as of december   we have issued four types of share based payment awards options  restricted stock units  performance stock options and performance share units 
the black scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date 
various inputs are utilized in the black scholes pricing model  such as stock price on measurement date  exercise price defined in the award  expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts  risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate  expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior  and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of consol energy stock and public peer group stock 
these factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders 
the fair value of each restricted stock unit awarded is equivalent to the closing market price of a share of our company stock on the date of the grant 
the fair value of each performance share unit is determined by the underlying share price of our company stock on the date of the grant and management estimate of the probability that the performance conditions required for vesting will be achieved 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note stock based compensation in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item in this form k for more information 
contingencies consol energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon the nature of the lawsuit  progress of the case in court  view of legal counsel  prior experience in similar matters  and management intended response 
future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings 
legal fees associated with defending these various lawsuits and claims are expensed when incurred 
see note commitments and contingent liabilities in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item in this form k for further discussion 
derivative instruments consol energy enters into financial derivative instruments to manage exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility 
we measure every derivative instrument at fair value and record them on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded currently in earnings unless special hedge accounting criteria are met 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of changes in fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods which the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current year 
consol energy currently utilizes only cash flow hedges that are considered highly effective 
consol energy formally assesses  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedge item 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  consol energy will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
coal and gas reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
our coal reserves are periodically reviewed by an independent third party consultant 
our gas reserves are reviewed by independent experts each year 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
see risk factors in item a of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves 
liquidity and capital resources consol energy generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings 
consol energy billion senior secured credit agreement expires april  the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of consol energy and certain of its subsidiaries 
consol energy credit facility allows for up to billion of borrowings and letters of credit 
consol energy can request an additional million increase in the aggregate borrowing limit amount

the facility includes a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than to  measured quarterly 
the interest coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of adjusted ebitda to cash interest expense of consol energy and certain of its subsidiaries 
the interest coverage ratio was to at december  the facility includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of no more than to through march  and no more than to thereafter  measured quarterly 
the leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing adjusted ebitda for consol energy and certain subsidiaries 
financial covenant debt is comprised of the outstanding indebtedness and specific letters of credit  less cash on hand  of consol energy and certain of its subsidiaries 
adjusted ebitda  as used in the covenant calculation  excludes non cash compensation expenses  non recurring transaction expenses  uncommon gains and losses  gains and losses on discontinued operations and includes cash distributions received from affiliates plus pro rata earnings from material acquisitions 
the leverage ratio was to at december  the facility also includes a senior secured leverage ratio covenant of no more than to  measured quarterly 
the senior secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of secured debt to adjusted ebitda 
secured debt is defined as the outstanding borrowings and letters of credit on the revolving credit facility 
the senior secured leverage ratio was to at december  covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets  make investments  purchase or redeem consol energy common stock  pay dividends  merge with another company and amend  modify or restate  in any material way  the senior unsecured notes 
at december   the facility had no outstanding borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding  leaving billion of unused capacity 
from time to time  consol energy is required to post financial assurances to satisfy contractual and other requirements generated in the normal course of business 
some of these assurances are posted to comply with federal  state or other government agencies statutes and regulations 
we sometimes use letters of credit to satisfy these requirements and these letters of credit reduce our borrowing facility capacity 
consol energy also has an accounts receivable securitization facility 
this facility allows the company to receive  on a revolving basis  up to million of short term funding and letters of credit 
the accounts receivable facility supports sales  on a continuous basis to financial institutions  of eligible trade accounts receivable 
consol energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services 
the cost of funds is based on commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to financial institutions 
at december   eligible accounts receivable totaled approximately million 
at december   the facility had million of outstanding borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding  leaving no unused capacity 
cnx gas billion senior secured credit agreement expires april  the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of cnx gas and its subsidiaries 
cnx gas credit facility allows for up to billion for borrowings and letters of credit 
cnx gas can request an additional million increase in the aggregate borrowing limit amount 
fees and interest rate spreads are based on the percentage of facility utilization  measured quarterly 
the facility includes a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than to  measured quarterly 
the interest coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of adjusted ebitda to cash interest expense for cnx gas and its subsidiaries 
the interest coverage ratio was to at december  the facility also includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of no more than to  measured quarterly 
the leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing adjusted ebitda for cnx gas and its subsidiaries 
financial covenant debt is comprised of the outstanding indebtedness and letters of credit  less cash on hand  of cnx gas and its subsidiaries 
adjusted ebitda  as used in the covenant calculation  excludes non cash compensation expenses  non recurring transaction expenses  gains and losses on the sale of assets  uncommon gains and losses  gains and losses on discontinued operations and includes cash distributions received from affiliates plus pro rata earnings from material acquisitions 
the leverage ratio was to at december  covenants in the facility limit cnx gas ability to dispose of assets  make investments  pay dividends and merge with another company 
the credit facility allows unlimited investments in joint ventures for the development and operation of gas gathering systems and provides for  of loans  advances and dividends from cnx gas to consol energy 
investments in cone are unrestricted 
at december   the facility had no amounts drawn and million of letters of credit outstanding  leaving million of unused capacity 
uncertainty in the financial markets brings additional potential risks to consol energy 
the risks include declines in our stock price  less availability and higher costs of additional credit  potential counterparty defaults  and commercial bank failures 
financial market disruptions may impact our collection of trade receivables 
as a result  consol energy regularly monitors the creditworthiness of our customers 
we believe that our current group of customers are financially sound and represent no abnormal business risk 
consol energy believes that cash generated from operations  asset sales and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments  anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit 
nevertheless  the ability of consol energy to satisfy its working capital requirements  to service its debt obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or to pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond consol energy control 
in order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future  consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length 
consol energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges  which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of million at december  the ineffective portion of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the year ended december  no issues related to our hedge agreements have been encountered to date 
consol energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued update intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the update is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets by simplifying how an entity tests those assets for impairment 
the update is also intended to improve the consistency in impairment testing guidance among long lived asset categories 
previous guidance required an entity to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount at least on an annual basis 
if the carrying amount exceeded its fair value  an entity needed to recognize an impairment loss in the amount of the excess 
the amendment to this update allows an entity to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
this assessment will determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment tests 
this type of testing results in guidance that is similar to the goodwill impairment testing in update the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  with early adoption permitted for impairment tests performed as of july  we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on consol energy financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in operations  consol energy is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding consol energy exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
consol energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal 
consol energy sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value 
consol energy uses fixed price contracts  collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas 
our risk management policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
consol energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base 
all of the derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures are held for purposes other than trading 
they are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty  volatility and cover underlying exposures 
consol energy market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters 
consol energy believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls  mitigates our exposure to material risks 
however  the use of derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures could materially affect consol energy results of operations depending on market prices 
nevertheless  we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
a sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the incremental effect on future earnings  related to open derivative instruments at december  a hypothetical percent decrease in future natural gas prices would increase future earnings related to derivatives by million 
similarly  a hypothetical percent increase in future natural gas prices would decrease future earnings related to derivatives by million 
consol energy s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
at december   consol energy had  million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under fixed rate instruments and million debt outstanding under variable rate instruments 
consol energy s primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility  under which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  consol energy s revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of per annum during the year ended december  a basis point increase in the average rate for consol energy s revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period 
cnx gas  also had borrowings during the period under its revolving credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate 
cnx gas facility had no outstanding borrowings at december  and bore interest at a weighted average rate of per annum during the year ended december  due to the level of borrowings against this facility and the low weighted average interest rate in the year ended december   a basis point increase in the average rate for cnx gas revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period 
almost all of consol energy s transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
hedging volumes as of january  our hedged volumes for the periods indicated are as follows for the three months ended march  june  september  december  total year fixed price volumes hedged mcf weighted average hedge price mcf fixed price volumes hedged mcf weighted average hedge price mcf fixed price volumes hedged mcf weighted average hedge price mcf
