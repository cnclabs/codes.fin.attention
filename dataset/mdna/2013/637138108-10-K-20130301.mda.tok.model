the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included in this report at item this report contains supplemental financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
national penn s management uses these non gaap measures in its analysis of national penn s performance 
these measures should not be considered a substitute for gaap basis measures nor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap 
management believes the presentation of the following non gaap financial measures  which exclude the impact of the specified items  provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of national penn 
tangible common equity excludes goodwill and intangible assets and preferred equity 
banking and financial institution regulators also exclude goodwill and intangible assets from shareholders equity when assessing the capital adequacy of a financial institution 
tangible common equity provides a method to assess the company s tangible capital trends 
tangible book value expresses tangible common equity on a per share basis 
tangible book value provides a method to assess the level of tangible net assets on a per share basis 
adjusted net income excludes the effects of certain gains and losses  adjusted for applicable taxes 
adjusted net income provides a method to assess earnings performance by excluding items that management believes are not comparable among the periods presented 
efficiency ratio expresses operating expenses as a percentage of fully taxable equivalent net interest income plus non interest income 
operating expenses exclude items from non interest expense that management believes are not comparable among the periods presented 
non interest income is adjusted to also exclude items that management believes are not comparable among the periods presented 
efficiency ratio is used as a method for management to assess its operating expense level and to compare to financial institutions of varying sizes 
management believes the use of non gaap measures will help readers compare national penn s current results to those of prior periods as presented in the accompanying discussion 
the company s strategic plan is designed to enhance shareholder value by operating a highly profitable financial services company within the markets it serves 
specifically  management is focused on increasing market penetration in selected geographic areas and achieving excellence in both retail and commercial lines of business

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the discussion below outlines the company s critical accounting policies 
for additional accounting policies and details refer to footnote to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
allowance for loan losses the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses the allowance is considered by management to be a critical accounting policy due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the allowance 
the allowance is established through a provision for loan losses provision charged as an expense in the consolidated statement of income 
the company continually reassesses the allowance and charges off uncollectible loans against the allowance when circumstances do not warrant continuance of the loan  or a portion there of  as a realizable asset 
recoveries of assets previously written off  if any  are credited to the allowance when they are received 
the allowance is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on its evaluation of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected defaults  estimated loss in event of default  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows or collateral liquidation values on impaired loans 
the process also considers historical loss experience  economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of acquired net assets in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on at least an annual basis  which the company performs during the second quarter of each year 
the company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of the company identified reporting units is less than its carrying value 
if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate the potential for impairment  the company would perform the two step goodwill impairment analysis 
in performing the two step goodwill impairment analysis  if necessary  the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to it carrying value  inclusive of goodwill assigned to it 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  an indicator of goodwill impairment exists and a second step is performed to determine if any goodwill impairment exists 
in the second step  the company calculates the implied value of goodwill by emulating a business combination for each reporting unit 
this step subtracts the estimated fair value of net assets in the reporting unit from the step one estimated fair value to determine the implied value of goodwill 
if the implied value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired  but if the implied value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference in the consolidated statement of income with a corresponding reduction to goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s business segments are its reporting units which are community banking and other for purposes of the goodwill impairment analysis 
in performing its analysis of goodwill impairment  the company makes significant judgments  particularly with respect to estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and if the second step is required  estimating the fair value of net assets 
the company evaluates each reporting unit and estimates a fair value as though it were an acquirer 
the estimates utilize historical data  cash flows  and market and industry data specific to each reporting unit 
industry and market data is used to develop material assumptions such as transaction multiples  required rates of return  control premiums  transaction costs and synergies of a transaction  and capitalization 
on an interim basis  the company evaluates whether circumstances are present that could indicate potential impairment of its goodwill 
these circumstances include  but are not limited to  prolonged trading value of the company s common stock relative to its book value  adverse changes in the business or legal climate  actions by regulators or loss of key personnel 
when the company determines that these or other circumstances are present  the company tests the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at an interim date 

table of contents other intangible assets are specifically identified intangible assets created from a business combination 
core deposit intangibles represent the value of checking  savings and other acquired  low cost deposits 
core deposit intangibles are amortized over the lesser of the estimated lives of deposit accounts or ten years on an accelerated basis 
decreases in deposit lives may result in increased amortization and or an impairment charge 
other intangible assets also include customer lists and covenants not to compete 
these assets are amortized over the lesser of their contractual life or estimated economic life on a straight line basis 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for future tax events that arise from the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates 
changes in tax rates are recognized in the company s financial statements during the period they are enacted 
when a deferred tax asset or liability  or a change thereto  is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  deferred tax expense or benefit is recorded within the income tax expense line of the consolidated statement of income for purposes of determining the current period s net income 
deferred tax assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at net realizable value 
the company periodically performs an assessment to evaluate the amount of deferred tax asset it is more likely than not to realize 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount of taxable income expected in future periods  as tax benefits require taxable income to be realized 
if a valuation allowance is required  the deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet is reduced via a corresponding income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income 
the company recognizes the benefit of a tax position in the financial statements only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
for these analyses  the company may engage attorneys to provide opinions related to certain positions 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions is recognized in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income 
other than temporary impairment when the fair value of an investment security is less than the carrying value  the security is considered to be impaired  and as such the company reviews the security for the presence of other than temporary impairment otti 
this analysis is performed at least quarterly  and includes the consideration of numerous factors including the time period for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value  curtailment or suspension of dividends or cash flows  deterioration of financial performance or the creditworthiness of the issuer  performance of any underlying collateral  and negative trends in a particular industry or sector 
the conclusion as to whether otti exists for an investment security is ultimately based upon the company s evaluation of the recoverability above its carrying value and its timing 
in addition  the company considers whether it plans to sell an investment security and whether it may be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its carrying value 
when the company concludes an investment security is other than temporarily impaired  a loss for the difference between the investment security s carrying value and the fair value is recognized as a reduction to non interest income in the consolidated statement of income 
for an investment in a debt security  if the company does not intend to sell the investment security and concludes that it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovering the carrying value  which may be maturity  the otti charge is separated into the credit and other components 
the other component of the otti is included in other comprehensive income  net of the tax effect  and the credit component of the otti is included in the consolidated statement of income as a reduction to non interest income

table of contents the company does not presently have any commitments for significant capital expenditures 
as measured using the consolidated statement of cash flows  the company deployed million and million of net cash and equivalents for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
operating activities generated million of net cash for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ended december   cash was deployed in the following ways financing activities million reduction in certificates of deposit million of payments to the fhlb and repayments of structured repurchase agreements million of treasury stock repurchased million of cash dividends paid to common shareholders investing activities million of investment security purchases million net increase in loans during the twelve months ended december   cash was generated from the following additional sources financing activities million increase in transaction and savings accounts million increase in short term borrowings investing activities million of proceeds from maturities  repayments and sales of investment securities interest rate risk management the company s largest business segment is its community banking segment  whose business activities principally include accepting deposits and making loans 
as a result  the company s largest source of revenue is net interest income  which subjects it to movements in market interest rates 
management s objective for interest rate risk management is to understand the company s susceptibility to changes in interest rates and develop and implement strategies to minimize volatility while maximizing net interest income 
the board of directors establishes policies that govern interest rate risk management 
this is accomplished via a centralized asset liability management committee alco 
alco is comprised of various members of the company s business lines who are responsible for managing the components of interest rate risk timing differences between contractual maturities and or repricing of assets and liabilities gap risk  risk that assets will repay or customers withdraw prior to contractual maturity option risk  non parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve yield curve risk  and variation in rate movements of different indices basis risk 
alco employs various techniques and instruments to implement its developed strategies 
these generally include one or more of the following changes to interest rates offered on products  changes to maturity terms offered on products  changes to types of products offered  use of wholesale products such as advances from the fhlb or interest rate swaps  and or purchase or sale of investment securities 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
minimizing the balance sheet s maturity and repricing risk is a continual focus in a changing rate environment 
the company uses a simulation model to identify and manage its interest rate risk profile 
the model measures projected net interest income at risk and anticipated changes in net income for a rolling twelve month period 
the model is based on expected cash flows and repricing characteristics for all financial instruments at a point in time and incorporates company developed  market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on these financial instruments 
the company also incorporates assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
while actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  this model is an important guidance tool for alco 
the following table demonstrates the anticipated impact of a parallel interest rate shift on the company s net interest income for the subsequent twelve months change in net interest income change in interest rates december  in basis points n a n a certain short term interest rates are currently below 
therefore  in a scenario where interest rates decline by basis points  short term interest rates decline to zero  resulting in a non parallel downward shift 
in this interest rate scenario  net interest income is estimated to decline for the subsequent twelve months by and based upon net interest income for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
guidance from the federal reserve indicates interest rates are expected to remain at current levels through in response to this guidance  national penn restructured million of fhlb advances to adjust its interest rate risk profile to be less asset sensitive 
as measured by the net interest income analysis  the company continues to have an asset sensitive risk profile 
as a result  in the event that interest rates increase  the company would benefit over the next twelve months 
for additional details on the fhlb restructuring refer to footnote and footnote within item of this report 
the results of the net interest income analysis fall within the compliance guidelines established by alco and the board of directors
