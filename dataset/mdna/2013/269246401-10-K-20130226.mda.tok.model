management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the company s performance 
the most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below as of or for the year ended december  variance vs 
customer activity metrics darts average commission per trade margin receivables dollars in billions end of period brokerage accounts net new brokerage accounts brokerage account attrition rate customer assets dollars in billions net new brokerage assets dollars in billions brokerage related cash dollars in billions company financial metrics corporate cash dollars in millions e trade financial tier leverage ratio e trade financial tier common ratio e trade bank tier leverage ratio special mention loan delinquencies dollars in millions allowance for loan losses dollars in millions enterprise net interest spread enterprise interest earning assets average dollars in billions percentage not meaningful 
the company transitioned from reporting under the ots reporting requirements to reporting under the occ reporting requirements in the first quarter of the tier leverage ratio is the occ tier leverage ratio as of december  and the ots tier capital ratio at december  and the ots tier capital ratio and occ tier leverage ratio are both calculated in the same manner using adjusted total assets 
customer activity metrics darts are the predominant driver of commissions revenue from our customers 
average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix  product mix and or product pricing 
margin receivables represent credit extended to customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they own 
margin receivables are a key driver of net operating interest income 

table of contents end of period brokerage accounts  net new brokerage accounts and brokerage account attrition rate are indicators of our ability to attract and retain brokerage customers 
the brokerage account attrition rate is calculated by dividing attriting brokerage accounts  which are gross new brokerage accounts less net new brokerage accounts  by total brokerage accounts at the previous period end 
changes in customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer 
an increase in customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding 
changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities 
net new brokerage assets are total inflows to all new and existing brokerage accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing brokerage accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new brokerage customers 
brokerage related cash is an indicator of the level of engagement with our brokerage customers and is a key driver of net operating interest income 
company financial metrics corporate cash is an indicator of the liquidity at the parent company 
it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries 
e trade financial tier leverage ratio is tier capital divided by average total assets for leverage capital purposes for the parent company 
e trade financial tier common ratio is tier capital less elements of tier capital that are not in the form of common equity  such as trust preferred securities  divided by total risk weighted assets for the holding company 
the tier leverage and tier common ratios are non gaap measures as the parent company is not yet held to these regulatory capital requirements and are indications of e trade financial s capital adequacy 
see liquidity and capital resources for a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to the comparable gaap measures 
e trade bank tier leverage ratio is tier capital divided by adjusted total assets for e trade bank and is an indication of e trade bank s capital adequacy 
special mention loan delinquencies are loans days past due and are an indicator of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off 
allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to management s forecast of loan losses in the twelve months following the balance sheet date as well as the forecasted losses  including economic concessions to borrowers  over the estimated remaining life of loans modified as troubled debt restructurings tdr 
see summary of critical accounting policies and estimates for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions used in the allowance for loan losses 
enterprise interest earning assets  in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread  are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income

table of contents year ended december  enterprise net interest spread margin net yield on interest earning assets ratio of enterprise interest earning assets to enterprise interest bearing liabilities return on average total assets total shareholders equity average total shareholders equity to average total assets the fluctuation in enterprise interest earning assets is driven primarily by changes in enterprise interest bearing liabilities  specifically customer cash and deposits 
average enterprise interest earning assets increased to billion for the year ended december  compared to this was primarily a result of the increases in average held to maturity securities  offset by a decrease in average loans 
average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased to billion for the year ended december  compared to the increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was due primarily to an increase in average deposits offset by a decrease in average securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
enterprise net interest spread decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  compared to  due primarily to lower yields on loans and the impact of the interest rate environment  which remains challenging 
we expect enterprise net interest spread will continue to compress in and anticipate a decrease of approximately basis points from  however  enterprise net interest spread may further fluctuate based on the size and mix of the balance sheet  as well as the impact from the level of interest rates 
commissions commissions revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the main factors that affect commissions are darts  average commission per trade and the number of trading days during the period 
average commission per trade is impacted by customer mix and the different commission rates on various trade types eg equities  options  fixed income  stock plan  exchange traded funds  mutual funds  forex and cross border 
accordingly  changes in the mix of trade types will impact average commission per trade

amount order flow revenue mutual fund service fees foreign exchange revenue reorganization fees advisor management fees other fees and service charges total fees and service charges the decrease in fees and services charges for the year ended december  was driven primarily by lower reorganization fee revenue in related to a large public company reorganization in the second quarter of  and by a decline in other fees and service charges due to decreased customer activity 
principal transactions principal transactions decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to principal transactions are derived from our market making business in which we act as a market maker for our brokerage customers orders as well as orders from third party customers 
the decrease in principal transactions revenue was driven primarily by a decrease in trading volume  partially offset by an increase in average revenue per share earned 
gains on loans and securities  net gains on loans and securities  net increased to million for the year ended december  compared to we recognized additional gains from securities sold as a result of our continued deleveraging efforts  primarily related to a reduction in wholesale funding obligations  which resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of million during the year ended december  the table below shows the activity and resulting variances dollars in millions variance year ended december  vs

table of contents net impairment we recognized million and million of net impairment during the years ended december  and  respectively  on certain securities in our non agency cmo portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in those specific securities 
the gross other than temporary impairment otti and the noncredit portion of otti  which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income loss  are shown in the table below dollars in millions year ended december  other than temporary impairment otti less noncredit portion of otti recognized into out of other comprehensive income loss before tax net impairment provision for loan losses provision for loan losses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in provision for loan losses was driven primarily by improving credit trends  as evidenced by the lower levels of delinquent loans in the one to four family and home equity loan portfolios  and loan portfolio run off 
the decrease was partially offset by million in charge offs associated with newly identified bankruptcy filings during the third quarter of  with approximately related to prior years 
we utilize third party loan servicers to obtain bankruptcy data on our borrowers and during the third quarter of  we identified an increase in bankruptcies reported by one specific servicer 
in researching this increase  we discovered that the servicer had not been reporting historical bankruptcy data on a timely basis 
as a result  we implemented an enhanced procedure around all servicer reporting to corroborate bankruptcy reporting with independent third party data 
through this additional process  approximately million of loans were identified in which servicers failed to report the bankruptcy filing to us  approximately of which were current at the end of the third quarter of as a result  these loans were written down to the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs  or approximately million  during the third quarter of these charge offs resulted in an increase to provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses has declined four consecutive years  down from its peak of billion for the year ended december  we expect provision for loan losses to continue to decline over the long term  although it is subject to variability in any given quarter 

table of contents operating expense the components of operating expense and the resulting variances are as follows dollars in millions variance year ended december  vs 
amount compensation and benefits advertising and market development clearing and servicing fdic insurance premiums professional services occupancy and equipment communications depreciation and amortization amortization of other intangibles facility restructuring and other exit activities other operating expenses total operating expense compensation and benefits compensation and benefits increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase resulted primarily from million in severance associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer that was recorded during the year ended december  clearing and servicing clearing and servicing decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to these decreases resulted primarily from lower trading volumes and lower loan balances compared to fdic insurance premiums fdic insurance premiums increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase for the year ended december  was due primarily to the new fdic insurance premium assessment calculation  effective in the second quarter of other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was driven primarily by an estimated liability of million related to an offer to purchase auction rate securities from eligible holders recorded in the costs of this program  which expired on may   were approximately million less than our previous estimate and a million benefit was recorded during the year ended december  in addition  there was a decrease in expenses related to real estate owned reo and repossessed assets for the year ended december  compared to 
table of contents other income expense other income expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to as shown in the following table dollars in millions variance year ended december  vs 
amount corporate interest income corporate interest expense gains losses on early extinguishment of debt corporate debt wholesale borrowings equity in income loss of investments and venture funds total other income expense percentage not meaningful 
total other income expense included corporate interest expense on interest bearing corporate debt for the years ended december  and corporate interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to in addition  for the year ended december   million in losses on early extinguishment of corporate debt were recorded  as a result of the early extinguishment of all of the springing lien notes and notes during we also had million in losses on early extinguishment of wholesale borrowings as a result of the early extinguishment of approximately billion in wholesale borrowings during during the year ended december   we had million in gains on early extinguishment of debt related to the call of the senior notes due september notes in the second quarter of income tax expense benefit income tax benefit was million for the year ended december  compared to tax expense of million in the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to in during the first quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to certain losses on the debt exchange that were previously considered non deductible 
through additional research completed in the first quarter of  we identified that a portion of those losses were incorrectly treated as non deductible in and were deductible for tax purposes 
the million tax benefit resulted in a corresponding increase to the net deferred tax asset 
in november  california voters approved proposition  which requires most multistate taxpayers to use a sales factor only apportionment formula  combined with market based sourcing for sales  other than sales of tangible personal property  effective for years beginning on or after january  as a result  the overall california apportionment for the company s unitary group decreased significantly and we expect this will decrease our taxable income in california in future periods 
as a result  we no longer expect to utilize net operating losses in california and we recognized tax expense of million consisting of establishing valuation allowances for california net operating losses  research and development credits and other deferred tax assets 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to the taxable liquidation of a european subsidiary 
the subsidiary was liquidated for us tax purposes in connection with our 
table of contents international restructuring activities 
this liquidation resulted in the taxable recognition of certain losses  including historical acquisition premiums that we incurred internationally 
this tax benefit resulted in a corresponding increase to the net deferred tax asset 
valuation allowance the net deferred tax asset was  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we did conclude that a valuation allowance was required  the resulting loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for the three year period ended december   we were no longer in a cumulative book loss position 
as of december   we did not establish a valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized 
approximately half of existing federal deferred tax assets are not related to net operating losses and therefore  have no expiration date 
we expect to utilize the vast majority of the existing federal deferred tax assets within the next six years 
our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance focused on identifying significant  objective evidence that we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future 
we determined that our expectations regarding future earnings are objectively verifiable due to various factors 
one factor is the consistent profitability of the core business  the trading and investing segment  which has generated substantial income for each of the last nine years  including through uncertain economic and regulatory environments 
the core business is driven by brokerage customer activity and includes trading  brokerage cash  margin lending  retirement and investing  and other brokerage related activities 
these activities drive variable expenses that correlate to the volume of customer activity  which has resulted in stable  ongoing profitability in this business 
another factor is the mitigation of losses in the balance sheet management segment  which generated a large net operating loss in caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets 
much of this loss came from the sale of the asset backed securities portfolio and credit losses from the mortgage loan portfolio 
we no longer hold any of those asset backed securities and shut down mortgage loan acquisition activities in in effect  the key business activities that led to the generation of the deferred tax assets were shut down over five years ago 
as a result  the losses have continued to decline significantly and the balance sheet management segment became profitable in in addition  we continue to realize the benefit of various credit loss mitigation activities for the mortgage loans purchased in and prior  most notably  actively reducing or closing unused home equity lines of credit and aggressively exercising put back clauses to sell back improperly documented loans to the originators 
as a result of these loss containment measures  provision for loan losses has declined for four consecutive years  down from its peak of billion for the year ended december  we maintain a valuation allowance for certain of our state deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
at december   we had state deferred tax assets of approximately million that related to our state net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences with a valuation allowance of million against such deferred tax assets 
tax ownership change during the third quarter of  we exchanged billion principal amount of interest bearing debt for an equal principal amount of non interest bearing convertible debentures 
subsequent to the debt exchange  million and million debentures were converted into million and million shares of common stock during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
as a result of these conversions  we believe we experienced a tax ownership change during the third quarter of 
table of contents as of the date of the ownership change  we had federal nols available to carry forward of approximately  million 
this amount includes million in federal nols that were recorded in the third quarter of due to amended tax returns we filed that related primarily to additional tax deductions on the debt exchange and additional tax losses on bad debts 
section imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation s nols  certain recognized built in losses and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs 
section rules governing when a change in ownership occurs are complex and subject to interpretation  however  an ownership change generally occurs when there has been a cumulative change in the stock ownership of a corporation by certain shareholders of more than percentage points over a rolling three year period 
section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre ownership change nols 
in general  the annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the corporation s stock immediately before the ownership change subject to certain adjustments by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused portion of the annual limitation is available for use in future years until such nols are scheduled to expire in general  nols may be carried forward years 
in addition  the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses  respectively  which may be present with respect to assets held at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five year period one year for loans after the ownership change 
the use of nols arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected unless a corporation experienced an additional ownership change in a future period 
we believe the tax ownership change will extend the period of time it will take to fully utilize our pre ownership change nols  but will not limit the total amount of pre ownership change federal nols we can utilize 
our updated estimate is that we will be subject to an overall annual limitation on the use of our pre ownership change nols of approximately million 
the overall pre ownership change federal nols  which were approximately  million  have a statutory carry forward period of years the majority of which expire in years 
as a result  we believe we will be able to fully utilize these nols in future periods 
our ability to utilize the pre ownership change nols is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income over the duration of the carry forward periods and will not be impacted by our ability or inability to generate taxable income in an individual year

this tax benefit resulted in a corresponding increase to the deferred tax assets  which were  million as of december  for the year ended december   our reported pre tax loss was relatively close to breakeven  which resulted in an unusually high effective tax rate 
valuation allowance during the year ended december   we did not maintain a valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets as we believed that it was more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized 
our evaluation focused on identifying significant  objective evidence that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognized that we were in a cumulative book loss position as of the three year period ended december   which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of deferred tax assets in the future 
however  we believed we were able to rely on our forecasts of future taxable income and overcome the uncertainty created by the cumulative loss position
