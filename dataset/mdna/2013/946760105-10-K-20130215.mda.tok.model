critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software and hardware for microcomputers  servers and networks upon shipment or upon electronic delivery of the product 
the company expenses the advertising costs associated with producing its catalogs 
the costs of these catalogs are expensed in the same month the catalogs are mailed 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write offs may be required 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
under the fair value recognition provision  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share based payment awards 
in connection with valuing stock options  we use the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our restricted stock programs we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to its activities in the united states  of the company s sales were generated in canada 
we are subject to general risks attendant to the conduct of business in canada  including economic uncertainties and foreign government regulations 
in addition  the company s canadian business is subject to changes in demand or pricing resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors 
the company s million investments in marketable securities at december  are invested in insured certificates of deposit at banks located in the united states of america
