item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements that contain the words believes  anticipates  expects  plans  intends and similar words and phrases 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results projected in any forward looking statement 
in addition to the factors specifically noted in the forward looking statements  other important factors  risks and uncertainties that could result in those differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a to part i risk factors in this annual report 
the forward looking statements are made as of the date of this annual report  and we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements  or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward looking statements 
investors should consult all of the information set forth in this report and the other information set forth from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to the securities act of and the securities exchange act of  including our reports on forms q and k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report 
overview on january   our board of directors changed our fiscal year end from july to december  in order to better align our financial reporting with our operational and budgeting cycle and with other industry participants 
we previously reported the results for our transitional period in a transition report on form q for the five months from august  to december  we own of our subsidiary  geic  which owns of idt energy and of gogas 
our principal businesses consist of idt energy  an rep supplying electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers in the northeastern united states  and genie oil and gas  which is pioneering technologies to produce clean and affordable transportation fuels from the world abundant oil shale and other conventional and unconventional fuel resources  which consists of amso  which holds and manages a interest in amso  llc  our oil shale project in colorado  and an interest in iei  our oil shale project in israel 
in addition  in february  giog was awarded an exclusive petroleum license by the government of israel covering square kilometers in the southern portion of the golan heights 
giog is controlled by genie oil and gas 
the grant of the license is subject to challenge by the competing applicant for the license which may be filed within days of the grant 
genie was incorporated in january references to us in the following discussion are made on a consolidated basis as if we existed and owned idt energy and genie oil and gas in all periods discussed 
as part of our ongoing business development efforts  we continuously seek out new opportunities  which may include complementary operations or businesses that reflect horizontal or vertical expansion from our current operations 
some of these potential opportunities are considered briefly and others are examined in further depth 
in particular  we seek out acquisitions to expand the geographic scope and size of our rep business  and additional energy exploration projects to diversify our gogas unit s operations  among geographies  technologies and resources 
as part of this process  in addition to other potential opportunities  we are currently actively evaluating several potential exploration and development projects for oil shale and other conventional and unconventional energy resources in other locations 
the energy development prospects vary in potential size  applied technology and potential time to commercial production 
for example  in june  we signed an agreement with the republic of mongolia for a joint geological survey of certain of that country s oil shale deposits 
the prospects we are evaluating or pursuing are in various stages of development and it is unclear when or if they will be developed or commercialized or prove to be profitable 
however  if one or more of these prospects were to be successfully commercialized  they could be significant in terms of their potential impact on our operations and financial condition  and could materially affect our financial results  future prospects and valuation 
spin off from idt we were formerly a subsidiary of idt 
on october   we were spun off by idt and became an independent public company through a pro rata distribution of our common stock to idt s stockholders 
as a result of the spin off  each of idt s stockholders received i one share of our class a common stock for every share of idt s class a common stock held of record on october   and ii one share of our class b common stock for every share of idt s class b common stock held of record on the record date 
on october   million shares of our class a common stock  and million shares of our class b common stock were issued and outstanding 
prior to the spin off  idt made a capital contribution of million to us 
in addition  in connection with the capital contribution received from idt  the amount due from idt as of the date of the spin off of million was forgiven 
we entered into various agreements with idt prior to the spin off including a separation and distribution agreement to effect the separation and provide a framework for our relationship with idt after the spin off  and a transition services agreement  which provides for certain  services to be performed by us and idt to facilitate our transition into a separate publicly traded company 
these agreements provide for  among other things  the allocation between us and idt of employee benefits  taxes and other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the spin off  transitional services to be provided by idt relating to human resources and employee benefits administration  the allocation of responsibilities relating to employee compensation and benefit plans and programs and other related matters  finance  accounting  tax  internal audit  facilities  investor relations and legal services to be provided by idt to us following the spin off and specified administrative services to be provided by us to certain of idt s foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  we entered into a tax separation agreement with idt  which sets forth the responsibilities of us and idt with respect to  among other things  liabilities for federal  state  local and foreign taxes for periods before and including the spin off  the preparation and filing of tax returns for such periods and disputes with taxing authorities regarding taxes for such periods 
idt energy idt energy resells electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and maryland 
idt energy s revenues represented of our consolidated revenues in the year ended december   the years ended july  and  and the five months ended december  and idt energy s direct cost of revenues consists primarily of gas and electricity purchased for resale 
since  idt energy has been party to a preferred supplier agreement with bp pursuant to which bp is idt energy s preferred provider of electricity and natural gas 
under the arrangement  idt energy purchases electricity and natural gas at a market rate plus a fee 
idt energy makes a monthly payment for its purchases and related fees 
any outstanding  unpaid balances accrue interest until paid 
idt energy s obligations to bp are secured by a first security interest in deposits or receivables from utilities in connection with their purchase of idt energy s customer s receivables  and in any cash deposits or letters of credit posted in connection with any collateral accounts with bp 
the term of the agreement is through june   with an automatic renewal for an additional year unless either party provides written notice to the other party at least six months prior to june  that it will not renew the agreement 
idt energy s ability to purchase electricity and natural gas under this agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the maintenance of certain covenants 
as a rep  idt energy does not own electrical power generation  transmission  or distribution facilities  or natural gas production  pipeline or distribution facilities 
instead  idt energy contracts with various pipeline and distribution companies for natural gas pipeline  storage and transportation services  and utilizes nyiso and pjm for electric transmission and distribution 
idt energy s direct cost of revenues include scheduling costs  independent system operator iso fees  pipeline costs and utility service charges for the purchase of these services 
for risk management purposes  idt energy utilizes forward physical delivery contracts for a portion of its purchases of electricity and natural gas  which are recorded in direct cost of revenues when the related electricity or natural gas is received from suppliers 
in addition  idt energy enters into put and call options as hedges against unfavorable fluctuations in market prices of electricity and natural gas 
the forward contracts and put and call options are recorded at fair value as a current asset or liability and any changes in fair value are recorded in direct cost of revenues 
the impact of these contracts and options on direct cost of revenues is relatively small in comparison to idt energy s purchases of gas and electricity for resale 
the nyiso and pjm perform real time load balancing for each of the electrical power grids in which we operate 
similarly  load balancing is performed by the utility or the ldc for each of the natural gas markets in which we operate 
load balancing ensures that the amount of electricity and natural gas that we purchase is equal to the amount necessary to service our customers demands at any specific point in time 
we are charged or credited for balancing the electricity and natural gas purchased and sold for our account by our suppliers and the ldcs 
we manage the differences between the actual electricity and natural gas demands of our customers and our bulk or block purchases by buying and selling in the spot market  and through monthly cash settlements and or adjustments to future deliveries in accordance with the load balancing performed by utilities  ldcs  nyiso and pjm 
the electricity and natural gas we sell is generally metered and delivered to our customers by the local utilities 
the local utilities provide billing and collection services on our behalf for most of our customers 
the proceeds are remitted to us less the utility s por fees and in some cases less fees for billing and other ancillary services 
the positive difference between the sales price of electricity and natural gas sold to our customers and the sum of the cost of our electricity and natural gas supplies  transmission and ancillary services provides us with a gross profit margin 
volatility in the electricity and natural gas markets impacts the cost of the electricity and natural gas that idt energy sells to customers 
for competitive and other reasons  idt energy may not always choose to pass along increases in costs to its customers for various reasons including competitive pressures and to protect overall customer satisfaction 
this can adversely impact idt energy s gross margins and results of operations 
alternatively  increases in idt energy rates charged to customers may lead to increased customer churn 
idt energy s selling expenses consist primarily of sales commissions paid to independent agents and marketing costs  which are the primary costs associated with the acquisition of customers 
general and administrative expenses include compensation  benefits  utility fees for billing and collection  professional fees  rent and other administrative costs 
seasonality and weather idt energy s revenues are impacted by  among other things  the weather and the seasons 
weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for natural gas for heating and electricity for air conditioning 
typically  colder winters and hotter summers increase demand for natural gas and electricity  respectively 
milder winters and or summers have the opposite effect 
natural gas revenues typically increase in the first quarter due to increased heating demands and electricity revenues typically increase in the third quarter due to increased air conditioning use 
approximately and of idt energy s natural gas revenues were generated in the first quarter of the years ended december  and  respectively  when demand for heating was highest 
although the demand for electricity is not as seasonal as natural gas  approximately and of idt energy s electricity revenues were generated in the third quarter of the years ended december  and  respectively 
concentration of customers and associated credit risk idt energy reduces its credit risk by participating in purchase of receivable programs for a significant portion of its receivables 
utility companies provide billing and collection services  purchase idt energy s receivables and assume all credit risk without recourse to idt energy 
idt energy s primary credit risk is therefore nonpayment by the utility companies 
certain of the utility companies represent significant portions of our consolidated revenues and consolidated gross trade accounts receivable balance and such concentrations increase our risk associated with nonpayment by those utility companies 
the following table summarizes the percentage of consolidated revenues from customers by utility company that equal or exceed of consolidated revenues in the period no other single utility company accounted for more than of consolidated revenues in any of the periods year ended december  five months ended december  year ended july  year ended july  five months ended december  unaudited con edison national grid usa na national grid dba keyspan na na na na less than of consolidated revenue in the period the following table summarizes the percentage of consolidated gross trade accounts receivable by utility company that equal or exceed of consolidated gross trade accounts receivable at december  and december con edison penelec na national grid usa na national grid dba keyspan na na less than of consolidated gross trade accounts receivable at december  or investment in american shale oil  llc we account for our ownership interest in amso  llc using the equity method since we have the ability to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial matters  although we do not control amso  llc 
amso  llc is a variable interest entity  however  we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary 
amso has agreed to fund amso  llc s expenditures as follows of the initial million of expenditures  of the next million in approved expenditures and of approved expenditures in excess of million 
amso has also agreed to fund of the costs of the one time payment for conversion of amso  llc s research  development and demonstration lease to a commercial lease  in the event amso  llc s application for conversion is approved 
the remaining amounts are to be funded by total 
through december   amso was allocated of the net loss of amso  llc 
amso s portion in the loss of amso  llc increased in december from to  per our agreement with total 
amso s allocated share of the net loss of amso  llc is included in equity in the net loss of amso  llc in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with the agreement between the parties  amso was committed to a total investment of million in amso  llc  all of which had been invested by january  amso remains obligated to fund its share of the expenditures it approves beyond the initial million investment 
amso s share of amso  llc s budget for the year ending december  is million 
there are also a number of other situations where amso s funding obligation could increase further 
total can increase amso s initial required funding commitment of million up to an additional million if total notifies amso of its commitment to continue to fund the pilot test up to an agreed upon commitment level 
to date  amso has not received such notification from total 
additionally  even if amso were to withdraw its interest in amso  llc  it will remain liable for its share of expenditures for safety and environmental preservation related to events occurring prior to its withdrawal 
total may terminate its obligations to make capital contributions and withdraw as a member of amso  llc 
if total withdraws as a member of amso  llc  amso may also terminate its obligations to make capital contributions and withdraw as a member of amso  llc 
although  subject to certain situations  amso and total are not obligated to make additional contributions beyond their respective shares  they could dilute or forfeit their ownership interests in amso  llc if they fail to contribute their respective shares for additional funding 
at december   our maximum exposure to additional loss as a result of our required investment in amso  llc was million  based on amso  llc s budget 
our maximum exposure to additional loss could increase based on the situations described above 
israel energy initiatives  ltd 
iei holds an exclusive shale oil exploration and production license awarded in july by the government of israel 
under the terms of the license  iei is to conduct a geological appraisal study across the license area  characterize the resource and select a location for a pilot plant in which it will demonstrate its in situ technology 
construction of the pilot test is expected to begin in late barring further permitting  regulatory or litigation driven delays 
we expect iei s pilot test to require approximately million of investment over the next three years 
we expect to use the cash that we currently have to finance the pilot test construction and operations 
in addition  we are considering financing iei s operations through partnerships and or sales of equity interests in iei 
iei does not currently generate any revenues  nor does it incur any direct cost of revenues 
primarily all of iei s costs and expenses are classified as research and development  which are charged to expense as incurred 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our critical accounting policies include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and  respectively 
our allowance is determined based on known troubled accounts  historical experience and other currently available evidence 
our estimates of recoverability of customer accounts may change due to new developments  changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy  which may impact our allowance for doubtful accounts balance 
we continually assess the likelihood of potential amounts or ranges of recoverability and adjust our allowance accordingly  however  actual collections and write offs of trade accounts receivables may materially differ from our estimates 
goodwill our goodwill balance of million at december  and is allocated to our idt energy segment 
idt energy is the reporting unit for our goodwill impairment test 
goodwill is not amortized since it is deemed to have an indefinite life 
it is reviewed annually or more frequently under various conditions for impairment using a fair value approach 
the goodwill impairment assessment involves estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying amount  which is known as step if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  step is performed to determine if an impairment of goodwill is required 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow methodologies  as well as considering third party market value indicators 
goodwill impairment is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value 
idt energy s estimated fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value in step of our annual impairment tests for the year ended december  and the years ended july  and  therefore it was not necessary to perform step for these tests 
in addition  we do not believe idt energy is currently at risk of failing step calculating the fair value of the reporting unit  and allocating the estimated fair value to all of the tangible assets  intangible assets and liabilities  requires significant estimates and assumptions by management 
should our estimates or assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting unit prove to be incorrect  we may be required to record impairments to our goodwill in future periods and such impairments could be material 
on january   we adopted the accounting standard update to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the update allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
we are no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit step unless we determine  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
income taxes our current and deferred income taxes are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with special and non routine items 
assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes is dependent on several factors  including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets  the results of internal revenue service audits of our federal income tax returns  and changes in tax laws or regulations 
we use a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following an increase in a liability for income taxes payable  a reduction of an income tax refund receivable  a reduction in a deferred tax asset  or an increase in a deferred tax liability 
we review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best estimate and judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at each reporting date 
to the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded  such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments 
results of operations we evaluate the performance of our operating business segments based primarily on income loss from operations 
accordingly  the income and expense line items below income loss from operations are only included in our discussion of the consolidated results of operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the financial data for the year ended december  is unaudited 
the financial data for the year ended december  is presented because it is the most appropriate period to compare with the year ended december  in order to discuss and analyze our operating trends and performance 
idt energy segment in millions change year ended december  revenues electric natural gas total revenues direct cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations revenues 
idt energy s electricity revenues increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   as a result of a significant increase in consumption  partially offset by a decrease in the average rate charged to customers 
electricity consumption increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and the average rate charged to customers for electricity decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in electricity consumption was the result of an increase in meters enrolled  coupled with an increase in average consumption per meter 
the decrease in the average rate charged to customers for electricity was primarily the result of a decrease in the underlying commodity cost 
in the second quarter of  idt energy entered an additional electric territory in pennsylvania with an addressable market of approximately seven hundred thousand meters 
in the third quarter of  idt energy entered its fourth state  maryland  and began marketing and enrolling customers in three electric utility territories in that state  as well as in one additional electric utility territory in pennsylvania 
in the aggregate  these new territories represent an addressable market of million meters 
in the fourth quarter of  idt energy entered an additional maryland electric utility territory that has an addressable market of approximately two hundred forty thousand meters 
idt energy natural gas revenues decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to unusually warm weather in the three months ended march  which reduced the demand for natural gas for heat 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average active meters during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as measured by heating degree days  a measure of outside air temperature designed to reflect the energy required for heating  new york state was warmer in the three months ended march  compared to the same period in the unseasonably warm weather contributed to decreases in both the per unit rate charged and in consumption per meter 
the per unit rate charged to customers decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consumption per meter decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decline in demand for heat as well as increased domestic production of natural gas and relatively high storage gas inventories caused a decrease in the underlying natural gas cost  which allowed us to decrease the average rate charged to customers for natural gas 
the decline in the average rate charged to customers for natural gas was also the result of discounts and promotional rates for new customers 
the decline in consumption in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the unusually warm weather was partially offset by an increase in meters served 
although the natural gas meters enrolled at december  were less than the meters enrolled at december   the number of meters served per month was higher in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  idt energy s customer base as measured by meters enrolled consisted of the following in thousands december  september  june  march  december  meters at end of quarter electric customers natural gas customers total meters gross meter acquisitions in the year ended december  were  compared to  in the year ended december  net meters enrolled increased by  or in the year ended december  compared to an increase of  meters or in the year ended december   as gross meter acquisitions were partially offset by higher rates of customer churn 
average monthly churn increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december   primarily because of the continued acceleration in customer acquisitions 
newly acquired customers have higher churn rates than longer term customers 
increased competition in some of idt energy s key utility markets also contributed to higher rates of customer churn 
the average rates of annualized energy consumption  as measured by residential customer equivalents  or rces  are presented in the chart below 
an rce represents a natural gas customer with annual consumption of mmbtu or an electricity customer with annual consumption of mwh 
because different customers have different rates of energy consumption  rces are an industry standard metric for evaluating the consumption profile of a given retail customer base 
the rce increase at december  compared to december  reflects primarily the increase in electric meters enrolled as well as  to a lesser degree  a shift in idt energy s electricity customer base to customers with higher consumption per meter 
a significant portion of idt energy s growth in rces was from recent expansion into electric only utilities territories  with higher electric consumption per meter than idt energy s legacy customer base 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in natural gas rces primarily due to consumption declines associated with the warmer than normal weather over the measurement period and a decline in gas meters served 
in thousands december  september  june  march  december  rces at end of quarter electric customers natural gas customers total rces direct cost of revenues and gross margin percentage 
idt energy s direct cost of revenues and gross margin percentage were as follows in millions change year ended december  direct cost of revenues electric natural gas total direct cost of revenues year ended december  change gross margin percentage electric natural gas total gross margin percentage direct cost of revenues for electricity increased in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  primarily because consumption increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by decreases in the average unit cost of in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  direct cost of revenues for natural gas decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decline in the average unit cost of in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  natural gas consumption decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gross margin on electricity sales decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of discounts and promotional rates we offered new customers 
gross margins on natural gas sales increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as the cost of the underlying commodity declined more sharply than we decreased the average rate charged to customers 
selling  general and administrative 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase in customer acquisition costs 
these costs increased an aggregate of million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  customer acquisition costs increased primarily due to the significant increase in the number of new customers acquired as a result of the expansion into new territories 
in addition  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was the result of increases in payroll  severance and stock based compensation expenses  which increased an aggregate of million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in stock based compensation expense is primarily due to expense from the november grants of restricted stock and stock options  as well as from the march grants of equity interests in idt energy 
the expense from these grants is recognized over the expected service period 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  included a million charge for new york city gross receipts tax pertaining to liabilities incurred in prior periods  which reduced the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of idt energy s total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  primarily because of the significant increase in costs related to customer acquisitions 
genie oil and gas segment genie oil and gas does not currently generate any revenues  nor does it incur any direct cost of revenues 
in millions change year ended december  general and administrative expenses research and development equity in net loss of amso  llc loss from operations general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as an increase in stock based compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our global business development efforts 
research and development 
research and development expenses in the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in expenses in our global development efforts outside of amso and iei 
iei s research and development expenses were million in the years ended december  and iei began its resource appraisal study in the third quarter of calendar  and completed the field work included in its study in late calendar year during the year ended december   iei continued lab work  engineering work and associated preparation of environmental permit applications that will initiate the pilot permitting process 
however  the israeli government has not yet published the final regulations required for preparation and submission of an environmental impact statement  which is a necessary prerequisite for the submission of a final permit application 
iei expects to begin construction of the pilot test in late  barring further permitting  regulatory or litigation driven delays 
we expect continued  significant increases in the expenses reflecting the costs of facility construction  drilling and operations of the iei pilot test as well as further staffing to support engineering and scientific operations and business development activities 
we expect iei s pilot test to require approximately million of investment over the next three years 
in february  giog was awarded an exclusive petroleum exploration license by the government of israel covering square kilometers in the southern portion of the golan heights 
giog is controlled by genie oil and gas 
the grant of the license is subject to challenge by the competing applicant for the license which may be filed within days of the grant 
we expect giog will begin to incur significant expenses related to its exploration program in the second quarter of equity in the net loss of amso  llc 
in the year ended december   amso  llc continued with late stage preparations for its pilot test 
the pilot test is intended to confirm the accuracy of several of the key underlying assumptions of amso  llc s proposed in situ heating and retorting process 
in january  amso  llc conducted a fully integrated commissioning test of the above and below ground facilities to determine their readiness for pilot test operations 
the underground electric heater did not perform to specifications during the commissioning test 
as a result  the manufacturer of the heater undertook extensive modifications and improvements 
there were additional problems during a second commissioning test in december amso  llc conducted a thorough readiness review and additional integrated testing  as well as acquiring additional equipment spares prior to beginning steady state pilot test operations 
these preparations were completed and in early march amso  llc initiated start up of the oil shale pilot test 
equipment modifications and technical issues are common in projects of the complexity and scope of the amso  llc pilot test  particularly given the extent to which new concepts and applications have been incorporated into the pilot test s design 
upon successful completion of the pilot test  amso  llc will evaluate the appropriate timing to submit an application to convert its research  development and demonstration lease into a commercial lease 
amso  llc also expects to design and implement a larger scale demonstration project to further test its process and operations under commercial conditions  and assess scalability to commercial production levels 
amso s equity in the net loss of amso  llc decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the decrease in amso  llc s net loss to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   notwithstanding that  beginning in december  amso s share of the loss of amso  llc increased from to  in accordance with our agreement with total 
amso  llc s net loss decreased as the costs associated with the pilot test facility construction were substantially completed in the year ended december  corporate corporate does not generate any revenues  nor does it incur any direct cost of revenues 
corporate costs include unallocated compensation  consulting fees  legal fees  business development expenses and other corporate related general and administrative expenses 
in millions change year ended december  general and administrative expenses and loss from operations the increase in general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to increases in payroll and related expense  legal and consulting fees and stock based compensation  including costs related to being a separate public company  following our spin off from idt 
the service agreements between idt and us include services provided by idt  such as transitional services relating to human resources and employee benefits administration  finance  accounting  tax  internal audit  facilities  investor relations and legal services  as well as specified administrative services to be provided by us to certain of idt s foreign subsidiaries 
the costs we incurred as a separate public company and the charges for additional services provided by idt were not included in our financial statements prior to the spin off since they were not applicable for periods that we were not a separate public company 
consolidated selling  general and administrative 
up until the spin off  idt  our former parent company  charged us for certain transactions and allocated routine expenses based on company specific items 
in addition  idt controlled the flow of our treasury transactions 
following the spin off  idt charges us for services it provides pursuant to the transition services agreement 
in the years ended december  and  idt charged us million and million  respectively  which was included in consolidated selling  general and administrative expense 
stock based compensation expense included in consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses was million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to expense from the november grants of restricted stock and stock options  as well as from the march grants of equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries 
the expense from these grants is recognized over the expected service period 
at december   aggregate unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation was million  which is expected to be recognized as follows million in the year ending december   million in the year ending december   million in the year ending december  and the remaining million from january through november the following is a discussion of our consolidated income and expense line items below income from operations 
in millions change year ended december  income from operations interest income financing fees other expense  net provision for income taxes net loss income net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net loss income attributable to genie financing fees 
financing fees are the volumetric fees charged by bp under the preferred supplier agreement between idt energy and bp  pursuant to which bp is idt energy s preferred provider of electricity and natural gas 
financing fees increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily because of the higher consumption by idt energy s customers 
other expense  net 
the decrease in other expense  net in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was mainly due to a decrease in foreign currency translation losses as well as a gain from the sale of idt energy s amount due from mf global 
on october   mf global  our former clearing broker  filed for bankruptcy protection 
on that date  idt energy held million of cash on deposit with mf global in support of hedging positions related to idt energy s commodity supply 
assets held by mf global were placed under the control of the court appointed bankruptcy trustee to be released as deemed appropriate 
in november  we transferred our hedging securities to an alternative clearing broker 
in october  we recognized a million loss  relating to our cash deposit with mf global  based on management s best estimate of the unrecoverable amount 
in november  we received million from a sale of the amount due from mf global and recognized a gain of million 
provision for income taxes 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in benefits from income tax due to the increase in gogas and corporate pre tax losses  as well as the reversal of million of accrued new york state income taxes as a result of a settlement of prior years income tax audits  partially offset by income tax expense from the recording of a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets 
subsequent to the spin off  we initiated a tax strategy that enables us to deduct losses from our foreign subsidiaries against our profitable us operations 
because of this strategy  the decrease in pre tax earnings of idt energy in  and our current projections  we concluded that we no longer met the criteria of more likely than not in order to utilize our deferred federal income tax assets in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred federal income tax assets 
prior to the spin off  we were included in the consolidated federal income tax return of idt 
our income taxes are presented for periods prior to the spin off on a separate tax return basis 
in the year ended december   idt charged us million for utilizing its net operating loss  which was included in provision for income taxes 
net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the change in the net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily relates to of the net income loss incurred by citizen s choice energy  llc  or cce  which is a variable interest entity that is consolidated in our idt energy segment 
we do not have any ownership interest in cce  therefore all net income or loss incurred by cce has been attributed to noncontrolling interests

idt energy began adding customers in select utility territories in new jersey and pennsylvania in the third quarter of the year ended july  idt energy s electricity revenues increased in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  as a result of an increase in consumption since the average rate charged to customers was basically unchanged 
electricity consumption increased and the average rate charged to customers for electricity decreased in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  the increase in electricity consumption was the result of relatively higher usage meters added in the new territories coupled with  in the first quarter of the year ended july  compared to the same period in the year ended july   warmer temperatures 
electricity consumption per meter increased in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  the decrease in the average rate charged to customers for electricity was primarily the result of discounted promotional rates for new customers and an effort to manage churn through rate adjustments during portions of the year ended july idt energy s natural gas revenues declined in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  primarily due to declines in the average rate charged to customers for natural gas 
the average rate charged to customers for natural gas decreased and natural gas consumption increased in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  the decrease in the average rates charged to customers for natural gas reflected discounted promotional rates for new customers as well as decreases in the average unit cost of natural gas of in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  the slight increase in natural gas consumption was primarily the result of an increase in meters served in the second half of the year ended july  compared to the same period in the year ended july  this increase in consumption offset the declines in consumption in the first and second quarters of the year ended july  compared to the similar periods in the year ended july   which were due to the loss of relatively high usage meters in upstate new york and the addition of a concentration of relatively low usage meters 
natural gas consumption per meter increased in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  idt energy s customer base as measured by meters enrolled consisted of the following in thousands july  july  meters at end of quarter electric customers natural gas customers total meters gross meter acquisitions in the year ended july  were  compared to  in the year ended july  the new meter acquisitions in the year ended july  were partially offset by customer churn  which resulted in net gains of approximately  meters since july  average monthly churn increased to in the year ended july  compared to in the year ended july   partially because newly acquired customers have significantly higher churn rates than longer term customers 
the average rates of annualized energy consumption  as measured by residential customer equivalents  or rces  are presented in the chart below

direct cost of revenues for natural gas decreased in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  primarily due to the decline in the average unit cost partially offset by the increase in consumption 
gross margins in idt energy decreased in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  due to increased competition and the impact of expansion into new territories in new jersey and pennsylvania  where gross margin was sacrificed to facilitate customer acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  was due to increases in customer acquisition costs and marketing costs  as well as a million accrual related to a utility tax audit by the new york city finance department 
customer acquisition costs increased primarily due to the significant increase in the number of new customers acquired as described above 
marketing costs increased as a result of testing new sales channels coupled with the expansion into new territories

financing fees are the volumetric fees charged by bp under the preferred supplier agreement between idt energy and bp  pursuant to which bp is idt energy s preferred provider of electricity and natural gas 
financing fees increased in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  primarily because of the higher consumption by idt energy s customers 
other expense income  net 
the change in other expense income  net in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  was due primarily to the change in foreign currency translation gains losses from a  gain in the year ended july  to a million loss in the year ended july  in addition  other expense income  net in the year ended july  included aggregate expense of million related to the change in the estimated fair value of the options to purchase shares of our subsidiary held by michael steinhardt  the chairman of the board of iei 
provision for income taxes

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the majority of the increase in the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  relates to of the net loss incurred by cce  which is a variable interest entity that is consolidated in our idt energy segment 
we do not have any ownership interest in cce  therefore all net income or loss incurred by cce has been attributed to noncontrolling interests 
cce began operations in the year ended july  cce s net loss in the year ended july  of million related primarily to sales commissions for customer acquisitions as cce grows its customer base 
the remainder of the increase in the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  was mostly due to increases in the net losses of amso and iei  which are included in the genie oil and gas segment discussed above  and in the noncontrolling interests share of a portion of these net losses 
the noncontrolling interests share of amso and iei losses increased as a result of the april sales of an aggregate interest in geic and the november sales of an aggregate interest in gogas

electric consumption increased  and the average charged to customers for electricity decreased 
the increase in electric consumption was the result of an increase in meters served coupled with an increase in the consumption per meter 
the decrease in the average rate charged to customers for electricity was primarily the result of a decrease in the underlying commodity cost 
idt energy natural gas revenues decreased in the five months ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to unusually warm weather in november and december which reduced the need for heat 
as measured by heating degree days  new york state was warmer in november and december than in the same period in the warm weather caused decreases in both the average rate charged to customers and in consumption  which decreased and  respectively 
the decline in demand for heat as well as increased domestic production of natural gas caused a decrease in the underlying natural gas cost  which allowed us to decrease the average rate charged to customers for natural gas 
the decline in the average rate charged to customers for natural gas was also the result of discounted promotional rates for new customers 
the decline in consumption was partially offset by an increase in meters served 
idt energy s customer base as measured by meters served consisted of the following in thousands december  september  june  march  december  meters at end of quarter electric customers natural gas customers total meters gross meter acquisitions in the five months ended december  were  compared to  in the same period in  which represented increases in meters served of and in the five months ended december  and  respectively 
the new meter acquisitions in the five months ended december  were partially offset by customer churn  which resulted in a net increase of in meters served or net gains of approximately  meters since july  the new meter acquisitions in the five months ended december  were more than offset by customer churn  which resulted in a net decrease of in meters served or a net loss of approximately  meters since july  average monthly churn increased from in the five months ended december  to in the five months ended december  in part due to the impact of the recent acceleration in customer acquisitions as new customers tend to churn at a higher initial rate than long term customers 
the average rates of annualized energy consumption  as measured by residential customer equivalents  or rces  are presented in the chart below

direct cost of revenues for natural gas increased in the five months ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to the increase in the average unit cost 
the increase in the average unit cost of natural gas was due to increases in the per unit cost of pipeline  storage and transportation services in the five months ended december  compared to the same period in as a result of lower natural gas consumption 
we purchase these services at the beginning of the heating season based on projected consumption  so the lower than expected natural gas consumption resulted in amortization of the amount purchased over a smaller number of units 
gross margins on electricity sales increased as the cost of the underlying commodity declined more sharply than the decrease in the average rate charged to customers 
gross margins on natural gas sales declined due to increased pipeline  storage and transportation costs in selected territories that were not fully recovered through rate increases during the period

cce  dad and tari corporation  or tari  are consolidated variable interest entities 
we determined that we have the power to direct the activities of cce  dad and tari that most significantly impact their economic performance  and we have the obligation to absorb losses of cce  dad and tari that could potentially be significant to cce  dad and tari on a stand alone basis 
we therefore determined that we are the primary beneficiary of cce  dad and tari  and as a result  we consolidate cce  dad and tari with our idt energy segment 
we provided cce  dad and tari with all of the cash required to fund their operations 
in the year ended december   cce  dad and tari repaid million to us 
in the five months ended december  and the year ended july   we provided cce  dad and tari with net funding of million and million  respectively  in order to finance their operations

since  idt energy has been party to a preferred supplier agreement with bp  pursuant to which bp is idt energy s preferred provider of electricity and natural gas 
idt energy s obligations to bp are secured by a first security interest in deposits or receivables from utilities in connection with their purchase of idt energy s customer s receivables  and in any cash deposits or letters of credit posted in connection with any collateral accounts with bp 
the term of the agreement is through june   with an automatic renewal for an additional year unless either party provides written notice to the other party at least six months prior to june  that it will not renew the agreement 
idt energy s ability to purchase electricity and natural gas under this agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the maintenance of certain covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
as of december   restricted cash of million and trade accounts receivable of million were pledged to bp as collateral for the payment of idt energy s trade accounts payable to bp of million as of december idt energy s new york state sales and use tax returns for the period from june though august are currently being audited 
at december   idt energy had accrued million for this audit and the estimated potential exposure above the amount accrued was million 
we are subject to audits in various jurisdictions for various taxes 
at december   we accrued for the estimated loss from these audits for which it is probable that a liability has been incurred  however amounts asserted by taxing authority or the amount ultimately assessed against us could be greater than the accrued amounts 
accordingly  additional provisions may be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or underlying matters are settled or resolved 
imposition of assessments as a result of tax audits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition

changes in trade accounts receivable and inventory gross trade accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december  reflecting the increase in our revenues in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  inventory of natural gas decreased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to the decline in the cost of natural gas at december  compared to december  contractual obligations the following table quantifies our future contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years idt energy s forward contracts purchase and other obligations operating leases total contractual obligations the above table does not include our unrecognized income tax benefits for uncertain tax positions at december  of million due to the uncertainty of the amount and or timing of any such payments 
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities 
we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential future payments 
if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in relevant sec regulations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  other than the following

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement  among other things  we indemnify idt and idt indemnifies us for losses related to the failure of the other to pay  perform or otherwise discharge  any of the liabilities and obligations set forth in the agreement 
pursuant to the tax separation agreement  among other things  idt indemnifies us from all liability for taxes of idt with respect to any taxable period  and we indemnify idt from all liability for taxes of ours with respect to any taxable period  including  without limitation  the ongoing tax audits related to our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
our primary market risk exposure is the price applicable to our natural gas and electricity purchases and sales 
the sales price of our natural gas and electricity is primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
hypothetically  if our gross profit per unit in the year ended december  had remained the same as in the year ended december   our gross profit from electricity sales would have increased by million in the year ended december  and our gross profit from natural gas sales would have decreased by million in that period 
the energy markets have historically been very volatile  and we can reasonably expect that electricity and natural gas prices will be subject to fluctuations in the future 
in an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the cost of electricity and natural gas on our operations  we have adopted a policy of hedging electricity and natural gas prices from time to time  at relatively lower volumes  primarily through the use of forward and future contracts and put and call options 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits future gains from favorable movements 
we do not apply hedge accounting to these contracts and options  therefore the mark to market change in fair value is recognized in direct cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
the summarized volume of idt energy s outstanding call and put options and future contracts as of december  was as follows commodity settlement dates volume electricity january  mwh electricity february  mwh natural gas february  dth natural gas august  dth
