item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
as discussed in special note regarding forward looking and cautionary statements earlier in this report  this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements  including as a result of the risks described in the cautionary statements in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  in our other filings with the sec  and in material incorporated herein and therein by reference 
we undertake no duty to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview we are a leading supplier of analog and mixed signal semiconductor products and were incorporated in delaware in we design  produce and market a broad range of products that are sold principally into applications within the high end consumer  industrial  enterprise computing and communications end markets 
the high end consumer market includes handheld products  tablet computers  set top boxes  digital televisions  digital video recorders  thunderbolt and fiberless high speed interfaces and other consumer equipment 
applications for the industrial market include broadcast studio equipment  automated meter reading  military and aerospace  medical  security systems  automotive  industrial and home automation  video security and surveillance and other industrial equipment 
enterprise computing product markets include optical receiver and transceiver  desktops  notebooks  servers  graphic boards  monitors  printers  and other computer peripherals 
communications market applications include base stations  backplane  optical networks  carrier networks  switches and routers  servers  cable modems  signal conditioners  wireless lan  and other communication infrastructure equipment 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers  including alcatel lucent  cisco systems  inc  huawei technologies co  ltd  lg electronics  motorola  nokia siemens networks  itron  apple  phonak international  research in motion limited  samsung electronics co  and zte corporation 
on march   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary semtech canada inc  completed the acquisition of all outstanding equity interests of gennum corporation gennum tsx gnd  a leading supplier of high speed analog and mixed signal semiconductors for the optical communications and video broadcast markets 
upon consummation of the acquisition  which constituted a change in control of gennum  gennum s stock option awards and restricted shares became fully vested 
we acquired of the outstanding shares and vested stock options  restricted shares  and deferred share units of gennum for cdn per share for a total purchase price of million 
the acquisition was financed with a combination of cash from our international cash reserves and million net of original issue discount of million of five year secured term loans with a combined interest rate of approximately see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
our primary reasons for the acquisition were to broaden our existing portfolio of high speed communications platforms with gennum s gbps to gbps signal integrity platform  to complement our gbps to gbps serdes solutions and to create one of the industry s most complete and robust analog and mixed signal portfolios 
in addition  gennum s strong position in video broadcast and the emerging hd video surveillance market further diversifies our portfolio of high performance analog semiconductors and provides cross selling potential with the combined customer base 
on march   we completed the acquisition of cycleo sas cycleo  a privately held company based in france that develops ip for wireless long range semiconductor products used in smart metering and other industrial and consumer markets 
this transaction  which was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting  complements our current wireless offerings and will bring customers a set of high end  digitally enhanced wireless solutions 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid the stockholders of cycleo million in cash at closing 
the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year include the results of operations of gennum and cycleo commencing as of the acquisition dates 
we operate our business in one enterprise wide reportable segment 
most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders 
many customers include cancellation provisions in their purchase orders 
trends within the industry toward shorter lead times and just in time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments 
as a result  we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a significant portion of our sales 
orders received and shipped in fiscal years represented of net sales 
sales made directly to customers during fiscal year were of net sales 
the remaining of net sales were made through independent distributors 
our business relies on foreign based entities 
most of our outside subcontractors and suppliers  including third party foundries that supply silicon wafers  are located in foreign countries  including china  taiwan  the united states  canada  europe and israel 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our silicon  in terms of cost of wafers purchased  was manufactured in china 
foreign sales for fiscal year constituted approximately of our net sales 
approximately of foreign sales in fiscal year were to customers located in the asia pacific region 
the remaining foreign sales were primarily to customers in europe and canada 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year presented below is our estimate of net sales by end market 
fiscal years in thousands  except percentages change enterprise computing communications high end consumer industrial and other total net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of compared to million for fiscal year fiscal year revenues increased driven by strengthening demand in the enterprise computing and industrial end markets and by the impact of approximately million of gennum sales in the current fiscal year  partially offset by a slight decrease in demand from the high end consumer and communications end markets 
fiscal year was also impacted by softening global economic conditions that resulted in a reduction in orders of our component products during the fiscal year 
higher revenue in the enterprise computing market is driven primarily by demand for the gennum product group optical communications products 
within the communications category  lower revenue was attributed to softer demand for g communications products in our advanced communications product line  partially offset by increasing demand for g communication products 
high end consumer revenues were relatively flat due to softer demand in protection products due to reduced demand from a north american tier smartphone customer offset by increasing demand for gennum product group thunderbolt cables 
higher revenue in the industrial category was attributed to video broadcast applications in the gennum product group and continued strength in the medical business of our wireless and sensing group 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
our gross margin was for fiscal year  down from in fiscal year gross profit margins for fiscal year were negatively impacted by the amortization of million of the fair value adjustment related to acquired inventory recorded to cost of sales from the gennum acquisition which offset a favorable end market product mix driven primarily by the impact of approximately million of gennum sales in fiscal year operating costs and expenses

net sales cost exp 
net sales change selling  general and administrative product development and engineering intangible amortization and impairments total operating costs and expenses selling  general administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal year increased by million or driven primarily by million of transaction and integration expenses due to the acquisition of gennum and cycleo in march and the impact of incremental gennum sg a expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal years include approximately million environmental reserves and million severance costs associated with the integration of the acquired gennum business with the company s pre existing business refer to note and note to our audited consolidated financial statements for details 
fiscal year includes million for expenses attributed to a reorganization plan initiated during the third quarter of fiscal year which resulted in consolidation of research and development activities and reduction in workforce 
sg a stock based compensation expense was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the year over year decrease in equity compensation was principally driven by staffing reductions associated with our reorganization actions in fiscal year partially offset by the increase in stock price in fiscal year product development and engineering expenses product development and engineering expenses for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively or an increase of 
the increase in fiscal year is principally driven primarily by the inclusion of gennum expenses of million since march the levels of product development and engineering expenses reported in a fiscal period can be significantly impacted  and therefore experience period over period volatility  by the number of new product tape outs and by the timing of recoveries from non recurring engineering services which are typically recorded as a reduction to product development and engineering expense 
intangible amortization and impairments intangible amortization and impairments was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase reflects the impact of million intangible amortization related to the acquisition of gennum and an impairment charge of million attributed to assets acquired from smi inc as of january   we had a total of million of gross carrying amount of finite lived intangible assets  which included million related to the acquisition of gennum 
the purchase price allocation for the gennum acquisition included million of acquired in process research and development ipr d projects 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
the fair value of the ipr d projects was determined using an income approach or replacement cost approach as applicable 
the replacement cost approach was used for ipr d projects that were considered long term core investments and were not anticipated to be profitable for a period of time 
ipr d projects which were valued using an income approach  measured the returns attributable to each specific ipr d project  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted rate of return  including as appropriate  any tax benefits derived from amortizing the intangible asset for tax purposes 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
for ipr d projects valued using a replacement cost approach  value was estimated by developing the cost to either replace or reproduce replicate the ipr d to its current state 
the top three ipr d projects that comprise million of the total million ipr d balance are for enterprise computing  communications and high end consumer products 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuation for such three ipr d projects at the acquisition date development projects estimated percent complete estimated time to complete in years estimated cost to complete in millions risk adjusted discount rate valuation approach ipr d in millions video platform to income backplane to na replacement cost consumer na replacement cost costs  timing  and successful completion are subject to additional risk factors such as i increase in the projected technological risk of completion  ii decrease in the projected market size for the developed product  and iii subsequent decisions to postpone or delay the development of the ipr d project 
actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
acquired in process research and development was tested for impairment as of november   the date of our annual impairment review 
with the exception of the impairment charge of million recorded to write off acquired ipr d from smi  we concluded that the fair value of the acquired in process research and developments exceeded the carrying value and no impairment existed as of january  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal year there was no interest expense in fiscal year the increase was due to interest expense and the amortization of the original issue discount and debt issuance costs related to the credit facilities to finance the acquisition of gennum see notes and to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we are currently assessing our financing alternatives and may decide to replace our existing debt with lower interest debt in fiscal year interest income and other expense  net 
interest income and other expense  net was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year in fiscal year  the interest income and other expense is primarily made of  swiss stamp duty tax liabilities 
in addition  interest income in fiscal year is lower as a result of a significant liquidation of investment to pay for acquisitions 
provision for taxes 
the benefit for income taxes was million for fiscal year compared to a provision of million for fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal year reflects the impact of the one time million benefit related to our change in assertion regarding million of foreign subsidiary earnings 
because income before taxes was near break even for fiscal year  comparison of year over year effective tax rates is meaningless 
in fiscal year  we concluded that million of foreign subsidiary earnings were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested offshore 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  in connection with the acquisition of gennum  we reviewed our assertion regarding the amount of foreign subsidiary earnings that were considered to be permanently reinvested offshore and concluded that due to post acquisition foreign operating cash needs  all of our foreign subsidiary earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested offshore 
this change in assertion resulted in the recognition of a one time tax benefit of million in the first quarter of fiscal year in fiscal year  our tax provision was adversely affected by a net increase to our valuation allowance of million 
this net increase was primarily the result of concerns related to our ability to utilize our california net operating losses due to a projected lower california apportionment in future years 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year presented below is our estimate of net sales by end market 
fiscal years in thousands  except percentages change enterprise computing communications high end consumer industrial and other total net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from million for fiscal year fiscal year revenues increased driven by strengthening demand in the communications and consumer end markets 
fiscal year was also impacted by softening global economic conditions that resulted in a reduction in orders of our component products during the fiscal year 
higher revenue in the communications end market was attributed to the impact of strengthening demand for our g and g communications infrastructure products in our advanced communications product line 
higher revenues in the high end consumer end market were driven by strengthening demand for protection products in consumer applications including lcd tvs  smartphones and tablet computers 
enterprise computing revenues were roughly flat 
within the industrial category  lower revenue was attributed to softer demand from the military segment in our power management and high reliability and advanced communications product lines 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
our gross margin was for fiscal year  up from in fiscal year gross profit margins for fiscal year were positively impacted by higher revenues  increased manufacturing volumes and the impact of reduced equity compensation expenses attributed to staffing reductions associated with a reduction in workforce 
these factors offset the impact of a higher mix of consumer and enterprise computing revenues relative to communications and industrial revenues 
operating costs and expenses

net sales cost exp 
net sales change selling  general and administrative product development and engineering intangible amortization and impairments total operating costs and expenses selling  general administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased by million or driven by the reduction in class action lawsuit expenses as the company settled the litigation in august  and lower equity compensation expenses partially offset by the impact of transaction expenses  reorganization charges and the impact of higher staffing and information technology infrastructure upgrade spending 
approximately million of transaction expenses attributed to the acquisition of gennum and the evaluation of other acquisition candidates were recorded in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal years and include approximately million and million net of insurance recoveries of million  respectively  for legal and other professional services incurred in connection with matters related to our historical stock option practices  including the government inquiries  the related litigation  and other associated matters 
fiscal year includes million for expenses attributed to a reorganization plan initiated during the third quarter of fiscal year which resulted in consolidation of research and development activities and reduction in workforce 
sg a stock based compensation expense was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the year over year decrease in equity compensation was principally driven by staffing reductions associated with our reorganization actions 
product development and engineering expenses product development and engineering expenses for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively or an increase of 
the increase in fiscal year is principally driven by the impact of increased new product and process development expenditures primarily in the advanced communications and protection product lines 
in addition  fiscal year includes a million expense associated with the impairment of a new process development initiative 
intangible amortization and impairments intangible amortization and impairments  which reflects amortization costs associated with acquired intangibles  increased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  as a result of the impact of impairment charges attributed to assets acquired from leadis technology inc during the third quarter of fiscal year  we abandoned certain development efforts related to acquired intangible assets and recorded an impairment charge of million 
interest expense 
there was no interest expense in fiscal year and interest income and other expense  net 
interest income and other expense  net was  for fiscal year  up from  in fiscal year for fiscal years and  the primary source of income was interest from investments offset by loss from foreign currency transactions 
provision for taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the effective tax rates for fiscal year and fiscal year were and  respectively 
the rate for fiscal year reflects the impact of favorable trends in our regional mix of income 
we expect our regional income trends to remain favorable 
however  certain items which occurred in fiscal year are not expected to recur in fiscal year one such item includes a one time benefit of million related to a release of previously recorded reserves for uncertain tax positions  as a result of statutes of limitations for the taxing authority to challenge the positions expiring 
in fiscal year  our tax provision was adversely affected by a net increase to our valuation allowance of million 
this net increase was primarily the result of concerns related to our ability to utilize our california net operating losses due to a projected lower california apportionment in future years 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including funds needed for working capital requirements 
as of january   our total shareholders equity was million 
at that date we also had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in long term investments  and total debt of million 
our primary sources and uses of cash during the comparative fiscal years are presented below fiscal year ended in millions january  january  january  sources of cash operating activities proceeds from exercise of stock options including tax benefits proceeds from sale of investments issuance of debt  net of original issue discount and debt issuance cost uses of cash capital expenditures  net of sale proceeds acquisitions  net of cash acquired purchase of intangible assets purchases of investments purchase of cost method investments payment of long term debt payment for interest rate cap repurchase of common stock effect of exchange rate increase on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents we incur significant expenditures in order to fund the development  design  and manufacture of new products 
we intend to continue to focus on those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities  which may require additional investment in equipment and the hiring of additional design and application engineers aimed at developing new products 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by our operations and our existing cash balances 
a meaningful portion of our capital resources  and the liquidity they represent  are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
as of january   our foreign subsidiaries held approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments compared to million at january  the decline was attributable to using approximately million to partially fund the acquisitions of gennum and cycleo and to cover transaction and other related expenses 
one of our primary goals is to improve the cash flows from our existing business activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments give us the flexibility to use our free cash flow to return value to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and also pursue business improvement opportunities 
additionally  we will continue to seek to maintain and improve our existing business performance with capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions that meet our rate of return requirements 
acquisitions might be made for either cash or stock consideration  or a combination of both 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to net income adjusted for non cash items plus fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities 
operating cash flows for fiscal year was impacted by several significant non cash transaction related items including million of purchase accounting adjustments related to inventory acquired from gennum  million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets from gennum 
also  accretion of deferred financing costs and debt discount was million 
investing activities cash used for investing activities is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of gennum and cycleo  capital expenditures  purchases of investments  offset by proceeds from the sales maturities of investments 
our marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities  generally with a minimum rating of a a or equivalent 
capital expenditures were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year acquisitions of gennum and cycleo were million  net of cash acquired 
funding of the purchase price was sourced from cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and required the liquidation of a significant amount of our temporary and long term investments 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the following net proceeds from credit facilities  proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the repurchase of common stock under the company s stock repurchase program and the payment of statutory tax withholding obligations resulting from the vesting of restricted stock settled by withholding shares 
in addition to using our cash  we incurred debt of million net of original issue discount of million in term loans during the quarter to complete the gennum acquisition 
on march   we entered into the senior secured first lien credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of million the facilities  consisting of term a loans in an aggregate principal amount of million the term a loans and term b loans in an aggregate principal amount of million the term b loans 
both the term a loans and the term b loans mature on march  repayments of long term debt during the fiscal year totaled million 
in accordance with the stipulations in the credit agreement  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement protecting at least of the variable interest rate exposure on the term loans and made an upfront payment of million in june under the terms of the facilities  we may request  at any time  subject to certain conditions  the establishment of one or more additional term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million  the proceeds of which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the facilities are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants 
we were in compliance with such covenants as of january  and we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants 
pursuant to the credit agreement  under certain circumstances  the company is obligated to apply of its excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement for each fiscal year  as well as net cash proceeds from specified other sources  such as asset sales  debt issuances or insurance proceeds  to prepay the term a loans and term b loans 
the first excess cash flow payment is estimated to be million 
the earliest date that any such payment may be due is days after the last day of the fiscal year ending closest to january  the company has classified the potential early payment of million from long term debt to current portion long term debt in the consolidated balance sheets as of january  the company may decide to replace and refinance its facilities associated with the gennum acquisition 
the company does not believe the terms associated with the new facilities will have a significant impact on the company s liquidity or operations 
for fiscal year  cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million compared to million in fiscal year we do not directly control the timing of the exercise of stock options 
such exercises are independent decisions made by grantees and are influenced most directly by the stock price and the expiration dates of stock awards 
such proceeds are difficult to forecast  resulting from several factors which are outside our control 
we believe that such proceeds will remain an important secondary source of cash after cash flow from operating activities 
we currently have in effect a stock repurchase program 
this program represents one of our principal efforts to return value to our shareholders 
in fiscal year and fiscal year  we repurchased million and million shares  respectively  under this program for million and million  respectively 
on august   we announced a million expansion of our existing stock repurchase program 
refer to exhibit of our current report on form k filed with the sec on august  for the complete announcement 
on november   we announced an additional million expansion of our existing stock repurchase program 
refer to exhibit of our current report on form k filed with the sec on november  for the complete announcement 
in addition to the stock repurchase program  shares valued at million and million were withheld in connection with the vesting of restricted stock to cover statutory tax withholding obligations in the fiscal years and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as those arrangements are defined by the sec  that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries or affiliated entities 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support 
we do not engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services  or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements 
noted below under contractual obligations are various commitments we have associated with our business  such as lease commitments and open purchase obligations  which are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet because we have not yet received the related goods or services as of january  contractual obligations presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of january  in thousands less than year years years after years total long term debt operating leases open capital purchase commitments other open purchase commitments other vendor commitments deferred compensation stock based compensation total contractual cash obligations capital purchase commitments  other open purchase commitments and other vendor commitments are for the purchase of plant  equipment  raw material  supplies and services 
they are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of january   as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 
we maintain a deferred compensation plan for certain officers and key executives that allow participants to defer a portion of their compensation for future distribution at various times permitted by the plan 
our liability for deferred compensation under this plan was million and million as of january  and january   respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on the balance sheet and in the table above 
the plan provides for a discretionary company match up to a defined portion of the employee s deferral  with any match subject to a vesting period 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended january   the company recognized million deferred compensation liability related to the payment of cycleo earn out liability which is contingent upon employment at the end of the four year period beginning on april  we have purchased whole life insurance on the lives of some of our current and former deferred compensation plan participants 
this company owned life insurance is held in a grantor trust and is intended to cover a majority of our costs of the deferred compensation plan 
the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance was million as of january  and million as of january   and is included in other assets 
we have million of accrued taxes for uncertain tax positions 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million within twelve months as a result of expiring statutes 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years 
a significant increase in inflation would affect our future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements  included in item  of this report on form k 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment  the size and number of certain large accounts and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
revenue and cost of sales we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
product design and engineering recoveries is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we include revenue related to granted technology licenses as part of net sales 
historically  revenue from these arrangements has not been significant though it is part of our recurring ordinary business 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a single licensing arrangement that resulted in the recognition of million of revenue 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of products to certain customers  principally distributors  under agreements which provide for limited pricing credits or product return privileges  until these products are sold through to end users or the return privileges lapse 
for sales subject to certain pricing credits or return privileges  the amount of future pricing credits or inventory returns cannot be reasonably estimated given the relatively long period in which a particular product may be held by the customer 
therefore  we have concluded that sales to customers under these agreements are not fixed and determinable at the date of the sale and revenue recognition has been deferred 
we estimate the deferred gross margin on these sales by applying an average gross profit margin to the actual gross sales 
the average gross profit margin is calculated for each category of material using current standard costs 
the estimated deferred gross margin on these sales  where there are no outstanding receivables  is recorded on the balance sheet under the heading of deferred revenue 
there were no significant impairments of deferred cost of sales in fiscal year or fiscal year the following table summarizes the deferred net revenue balance in thousands january  january  deferred revenues deferred cost of revenues deferred revenue  net deferred product design and engineering recoveries total deferred revenue inventory valuation our inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
in order to state our inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain specific reserves against our inventory which serve to write down our inventories to a new cost basis 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value 
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses  in process research and development is recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  contingent consideration obligations are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition  with increases or decreases in the fair value arising from changes in assumptions or discount periods recorded as contingent consideration expenses in the consolidated statement of operations in subsequent periods  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent consideration  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination and in assigning their respective useful lives 
the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management at the time 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments we utilized  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
interest rate derivative we manage interest expense using variable rate debt 
to manage its interest rate risk  we occasionally hedge the future cash flows of its variable rate debt  principally through interest rate contracts with major financial institutions 
interest rate cap contracts involve the receipts of variable amounts from a counterparty when one month libor exceeds the capped interest rate in exchange for an upfront payment from us  capping our one month libor floating interest payments at the strike rate on its interest rate cap contract 
interest rate contracts that meet specific criteria are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes  and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings 
amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable rate debt 
the assessment of effectiveness is based on the total changes in an option s cash flows such that the assessment will include the interest rate caps entire change in fair value 
the interest rate cap is considered a highly effective hedge since the key features and terms match with the hedged item at inception 
key features and terms are notional amount  cap effective date  rate threshold  index  repricing dates  payments dates  and maturity dates 
contingencies and litigation we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available 
individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable 
the legal defense costs we accrue is based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management and some of the significant factors considered in the review of these reserves are as follows the actual costs incurred by the company  the development of the company legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation  the number of cases being brought against the company  the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing  progression  and related costs of pre trial activities and trials in the associated litigation 
in those situations where the company is unable to determine the best estimate within the range of loss  it will record the minimum amount in the identified range of probable loss 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value using a valuation model  which considers  among other things  estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture  expected life of options and stock price volatility 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period and actual results may differ from estimates 
impairment of goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
for our annual impairment review  we primarily use a multi period excess earnings approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of the assets 
our assumptions incorporate judgments as to the price received to sell a reporting unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
considering the integration of our operations  we have assumed that the highest and best use of a reporting unit follows an in use valuation premise 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur impairment charges in a future period 
goodwill is tested for impairment as of november  the date of our annual impairment review 
we estimated the fair values of our reporting units using the income approach  which requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
our analysis included sensitivity analysis of key assumptions such as a increase in the weighted average cost of capital  a increase in the effective tax rate or a decline in our compound annual growth rate noting the fair value of the goodwill associated with the advanced communications  the wireless and sensing  and gennum reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and no impairment existed as of january  the company reviews indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that asset is expected to generate 
acquired in process research and development projects ipr d is tested for impairment as of november  the date of the company s annual goodwill impairment review 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent we change a valuation allowance  the change is recorded through the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management periodically evaluates our deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we consider projected taxable income 
the most significant assumptions used in preparing projections of taxable income include forecasting the levels of income by region and the amount of deductible stock based compensation 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant management estimates are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax impact is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period of change 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
the income tax effects of share based payments are recognized for financial reporting purposes only if such awards are expected to result in a tax deduction 
we do not recognize a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that is  a tax benefit that exceeds the amount of compensation cost recognized for the award for financial reporting purposes that has not been realized 
in determining when an excess tax benefit is realized  we have elected to follow the ordering provision of the tax law 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate discussed above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
in general  the amount of taxes we pay will differ from our reported tax provision as a result of differences between accounting for income under us gaap and accounting for taxable income 
typical book tax differences include expense related to equity compensation  deemed dividends  depreciation  litigation expense and amortization of intangible assets 
as a result of these book tax differences  our tax payments are expected to exceed our tax provision during the next three years 
for intra entity differences between the tax basis of an asset in the buyer s tax jurisdiction and their cost as reported in the consolidated financial statements  we do not recognize a deferred tax asset 
income taxes paid on intra entity profits on assets remaining within the group are accounted for as prepaid taxes 
we continually review our position on undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to determine whether those earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore 
domestic and foreign operating cash flow forecasts are reviewed to determine the sources and uses of cash 
based on these forecasts  we determine the need to accrue deferred tax liabilities associated with our undistributed earnings offshore 
new accounting standards in february  the fasb issued an accounting standards update regarding the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this update  which will be effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december   requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the company will adopt the disclosure requirements of this update for the quarter ending april  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of market risks  including commodity risk and the risks related to foreign currency  interest rates and market performance that are detailed below 
many of the factors that can have an impact on our market risk are external to us  and so we are unable to fully predict them 
market conditions current global economic conditions pose a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to the uncertainty around tighter credit and negative financial news 
these conditions have historically resulted in periods where demand for our products is reduced 
in addition to risks associated with global economic conditions  demand for our products could be different from our expectations due to customer acceptance of our products  changes in customer order patterns  including order cancellations  and changes in the level of inventory held by vendors 
commodity risk we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials  particularly gold  that are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to process our end products 
increased commodity prices are passed on to us in the form of higher prices from our suppliers  either in the form of general price increases or a commodity surcharge 
although we generally deal with our suppliers on a purchase order basis rather than on a long term contract basis  we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing for volumes consistent with planned production 
our gross margins may decline if we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset the increased cost 
we do not enter into formal hedging arrangements to mitigate against commodity risk 
foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and we could experience foreign currency exchange gains or losses 
historically  we have not considered our foreign currency exposure to be material 
therefore  we have not utilized foreign currency hedging products to mitigate foreign currency risks 
our foreign currency exposures may increase over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows 
changes in the rates could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
a relatively small amount of our monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the swiss franc  canadian dollars  mexican peso  british pound sterling and the euro 
fluctuations in these currencies relative to the united states dollar will result in transaction gains or losses included in net earnings 
all of our foreign sales  which amounted to million in fiscal year  are denominated in united states dollars 
currency exchange rate fluctuations in foreign countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 
for fiscal year  we spent approximately million in canadian dollars  million in british pound sterling  million in swiss francs  million in euros  million in japanese yen  and million in mexican pesos for operating expenses 
in general  we purchase foreign currencies on a spot basis as needed to fund local operations 
as of january   we held cash funds of million denominated in canadian dollars  million denominated in british pound sterling  million denominated in swiss francs  million denominated in euros and million denominated in japanese yen  and million denominated in mexican pesos 
we did not hold a significant amount of other foreign currencies 
if rates of these foreign currencies were to strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar  we would realize gains or losses in converting these funds back into us dollars 
interest rate and market risk as a result of entering into the million long term debt with variable interest rates  our operating results are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
pursuant to the credit agreement  we were required to enter into an interest rate hedging agreement protecting at least of all the variable interest rate exposure on the term loans within days of entering into the credit agreement 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
on june   we entered into an interest rate cap agreement to fulfill the requirements of our credit agreement see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points and holding all other variables constant  annual net income and cash flows for the following year would decrease by approximately million associated with the company s variable rate debt  including the effect of the interest rate contract 
the effect of the basis points increase would decrease the fair value of our variable rate debt by approximately million 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of temporary and long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of million in fiscal year a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
our investments are subject to market risks  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers following investment guidelines set by us 
such guidelines prescribe credit quality  permissible investments  diversification  and duration restrictions 
these restrictions are intended to limit risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term durations 
our investment strategy limits investment of new funds and maturing securities to us treasury  federal agency securities  high quality money market funds and time deposits with our principal commercial banks
