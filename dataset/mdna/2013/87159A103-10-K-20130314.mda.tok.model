item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in this report 
certain statements in this section are forward looking 
while we believe these statements are accurate  our business is dependent on many factors  some of which are discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and business 
many of these factors are beyond our control and any of these and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements made in this report 
we undertake no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to the statements contained in this report to reflect events or circumstances that occur subsequent to the date of this report 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development  and commercialization of therapeutic products for patients with life threatening rare diseases and unmet medical needs 
our management team is experienced in the development and commercialization of drugs for diseases with small patient populations  including clinical and translational research  working with payors to establish reimbursement  and designing and building commercial organizations to reach highly specialized physicians to facilitate patient identification 
we have several protein therapeutics in our pipeline  including two enzyme replacement therapies for lysosomal storage disorders and additional programs for life threatening genetic conditions for which there are currently no approved treatments 
our lead program  sebelipase alfa  is a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase lal currently under global clinical investigation for the treatment of patients with early and late onset lal deficiency lal deficiency  which is a rare  devastating genetic disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality 
we currently evaluate sebelipase alfa in global clinical trials and sebelipase alfa has been granted orphan designations by the us food and drug administration fda  the european medicines agency  and the japanese ministry of health  labour and welfare 
additionally  sebelipase alfa received fast track designation by the fda 
we have not yet received approval to market this product and we are not currently commercializing any other products 
basis of presentation fiscal and prior periods as described in item  on november   synageva biopharma corp  a privately held delaware corporation private synageva closed the a merger transaction the reverse merger with trimeris  inc trimeris as of november   after giving effect to the reverse merger the former stockholders of private synageva collectively owned approximately and the stockholders of trimeris prior to the reverse merger pre merger trimeris owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the reverse merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
as such  the financial statements of private synageva are treated as our historical financial statements  with the results of trimeris being included from november  immediately following the closing of the reverse merger  private synageva designees to our board of directors represented a majority of our directors  private synageva s senior management represented our entire senior management and the operations formerly conducted by private synageva were our only continuing development efforts 
for periods prior to the closing of the reverse merger  therefore  our discussion below relates to the historical business and operations of private synageva 
certain portions of this annual report on form k may contain information that relates to pre merger trimeris previous operations  which are no longer material to our business 
any comparison of pre merger trimeris revenues and operations with ours may not be helpful to an understanding of our results for the years ended december   or future periods 
financial operations overview general our future operating results will depend on the progress of drug candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and will depend largely on  among other factors  the cost and outcome of any preclinical development or clinical trials then being conducted 

table of contents a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity  capital requirements and ability to raise additional funds is set forth under the section entitled risk factors in this report 
revenue royalty revenue royalty revenue relates to amounts earned from the sale of fuzeon by f 
hoffman la roche ltd 
roche 
the fuzeon royalty stream was acquired in the reverse merger in the fourth quarter of fiscal collaboration and license revenue collaboration and license revenue primarily relates to our collaboration agreements with mitsubishi tanabe pharma corporation mitsubishi tanabe whereby we utilize our proprietary expression technology in two development programs  in exchange for upfront license payments  funded development  and the potential for additional payments upon the successful completion of the development programs 
under the first program  which was entered into in august  we received an upfront license payment of million  on going funding of development costs  and the potential for an additional payment of million due upon the successful completion of the initial development 
additionally  we entered into a second agreement in march  where we received an upfront license payment of million  on going funding of development costs  and the potential for an additional payment of million due upon the successful completion of the initial development stage of the second program 
under both agreements  mitsubishi tanabe has an option to obtain an exclusive royalty bearing license  with the right to grant sublicenses  to further develop and commercialize the licensed compound 
if mitsubishi tanabe exercises its option  the parties intend to negotiate a follow on collaboration and license agreement that may include potential future development and commercial sales based milestone payments  and potential royalty payments 
other revenue other revenues relate to a national institutes of health nih grant  which was completed in the first quarter of fiscal research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop drug candidates  including personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs  outside consulting services and other external costs 
research and development expense includes any costs associated with generating collaboration or grant revenue 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  stock based compensation expense and other related costs for personnel in executive  business development  commercial  finance  human resource  legal  information technology  and support personnel functions 
we also expense patent costs and expenses associated with maintaining our intellectual property as incurred 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  accounting and commercial services 
amortization of developed technology we provide for the cost of amortization of developed technology  computed using an accelerated method based on the undiscounted cash flows received from the fuzeon royalty stream  in proportion to the estimated total undiscounted cash flows 
interest income expense  net interest income relates to interest earned on our cash equivalent and short term investment balances 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and revenues the following table presents total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands year ended december  change change royalty revenue collaboration and license revenue other revenue total revenue total revenues increased by approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the comparable period of the prior year 
the increase in revenues was primarily the result of higher fuzeon royalty revenue and higher collaboration revenue 
royalty revenues of million relate to the royalty payment earned from roche  based on total worldwide net sales of fuzeon 
we did not have any royalty revenue from fuzeon until after the reverse merger  which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal collaboration and license revenue for the year ended december  relates to revenue recognized from development programs with mitsubishi tanabe 
for the year ended december   we recognized million and million related to the first and second mitsubishi tanabe programs  respectively 
for the year ended december   collaboration and license revenue totaled million primarily related to revenue recognized related to the first mitsubishi tanabe program 
other revenues relate to an nih grant  and totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect fuzeon royalty revenues to decrease over time  from the levels experienced in fiscal royalty revenue increased in as compared to  due to the inclusion of a full year of fuzeon royalty revenue in our results of operations 
additionally  as of december   our deferred revenue balance related to both of the mitsubishi tanabe collaboration agreements  totaled million 
we expect to recognize both the upfront development payments  which are included in deferred revenue  and the additional funded development payments related to both arrangements over the next year  in proportion to our performance under the arrangements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december  and are summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  change change compensation and benefits related clinical trials and manufacturing other development related external services facilities and related stock based compensation expense acquired in process research and development total research and development expense research and development expense increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the increase in total research and development expense is due to increased clinical trial costs and manufacturing fees  as well as other 
table of contents development related external services  associated with on going development of sebelipase alfa and our pipeline programs and higher compensation expense from hiring additional staff to move the sebelipase alfa and pipeline programs forward 
additionally  in fiscal  research and development expense includes million of stock based compensation expense and million related to acquired in process research and development 
we expect research and development expense to continue to increase as development activities for sebelipase alfa and our other pipeline programs continue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and are summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  change change compensation and benefits related external and professional services facilities related and other stock based compensation expense total general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the increase was primarily due to higher compensation related expenses of million and increased stock based compensation expense of million  resulting from hiring additional staff to support expanded operations and the increasing financial and legal costs associated with public company requirements and commercial preparations 
additionally  external fees and professional service costs increased million period over period  primarily a result of higher commercial related spending  higher public company costs  including insurance expense and higher professional service fees 
we expect general and administrative expense to continue to increase in the future as our business grows 
amortization of developed technology costs recognized for the amortization of developed technology for the year ended december  and are summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  change change amortization of developed technology in fiscal  we recognized million of amortization related to the developed technology acquired in the reverse merger  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was due to the inclusion of a full year of fuzeon royalty revenue  and therefore  the related amortization  in our results of operations 
other expense income  net in  we recognized million of other expense associated with the revaluation of preferred stock warrants that were exercised in fiscal all preferred stock warrants have been exercised 
we did not have any activity in other expense income in fiscal years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased by approximately million  or  to million  for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was 
table of contents the result of the addition of fuzeon royalty revenue following the completion of the reverse merger  higher collaboration revenues and higher grant revenues as compared to the prior year 
royalty revenues of million represent the royalty payment earned from roche based on total worldwide net sales of fuzeon since the closing of the reverse merger in november collaboration and license revenue totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
grant revenues relate to an nih grant  and totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are summarized as follows year ended december  change change compensation and benefits related clinical trials and manufacturing other development related external services facilities related non cash stock based compensation total research and development expense research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to increased spending related to our lead program sebelipase alfa 
the increase included clinical trial costs and manufacturing fees associated with our on going sebelipase alfa development as well as higher compensation expense from the hiring of additional staff to move the sebelipase alfa program forward 
as part of these activities  we also incurred additional facilities expense resulting from the opening of our corporate headquarters and laboratory facilities in lexington  massachusetts in september increases were partially off set by lower pre clinical expenses for as compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher external services costs of million  including legal and accounting fees as well as commercial activities  and higher compensation expense of million  resulting from hiring additional staff to support public company requirements as well as commercial preparations 
in  we incurred approximately million in transaction related fees related to the reverse merger with trimeris 
as part of these activities  we also incurred additional facilities expense of million resulting from the opening of our corporate headquarters and laboratory facilities in lexington  massachusetts in september amortization of developed technology we recognized million of costs related to the amortization of developed technology in fiscal amortization of developed technology is computed using an accelerated method based on the undiscounted cash flows received from the fuzeon royalty stream post reverse merger  in proportion to the estimated total undiscounted cash flows 
other expense income  net other expense income  net decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the receipt of a tax grant related to the approval of our applications for the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program during for  this grant program was not available 
in  we recognized other expense associated with the revaluation of preferred stock warrants 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have financed our operations to date primarily through the placement of our equity and debt securities and debt financings  and  to a lesser extent  license and royalty fees  upfront cash payments and research and development funding from collaborators  government grants and licensors 
in november  we acquired million in cash as a result of the reverse merger with trimeris 
on january   we announced the closing of a million underwritten public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this offering 
in addition  on july   we announced the closing of a million  second underwritten public offering of approximately million shares of common stock at a price of 
we received net proceeds of approximately million 
on january   we announced the closing of a million underwritten public offering of approximately million shares of common stock at a price of 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this offering 
we intend to use the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes  which may include working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures  preclinical and clinical trial expenditures  commercial expenditures  acquisitions of new technologies or businesses that are complementary to our current technologies and business focus and investments 
we do not expect to generate any revenue from the direct sale of products currently in development for several years  if ever 
as a result of our acquisition of trimeris  we now receive royalties from the sale of fuzeon by roche  which we expect to decrease over time 
a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will be quarterly royalty payments from roche based on sales of fuzeon  up front license payments and funded research and development that we may receive under existing or new collaboration agreements  if any 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
our cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of investments in money market funds 
cash flows the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office  laboratory  and manufacturing facilities  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  clinical studies  outsourced manufacturing  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  commercial fees and legal fees 
we expect that costs associated with clinical studies and manufacturing costs as well as commercial planning costs will increase in future periods as sebelipase alfa advances into further stages of clinical testing and our other preclinical candidates move forward in development 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily the result of a net loss of million  which is discussed in further detail in results of operations 
in addition  non cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities affected operating cash during fiscal non cash items partially offsetting net loss include depreciation of fixed assets of million  amortization of developed technology of million  stock based compensation of million  amortization of discount on available for sale investments of million and in process research and development of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net source of cash of million  which was primarily the result of increased deferred revenue of million from december  the increase in deferred revenue in the period was primarily the result of the upfront license fees related to the second mitsubishi tanabe development program 
other significant sources of cash included increased accounts payable and accrued expenses of million from december   which was offset by a use of cash of million related to prepaid expenses and other current assets and million related to increased accounts receivable 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of a net loss of million  as discussed in further detail in results of operations 
in addition  changes in certain operating assets and liabilities and non cash items affected operating cash during the year ended december  changes in 
table of contents operating assets and liabilities that partially offset the cash impact of our net loss include million from a net decrease in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  primarily due to receipt of royalty receivables that were recorded as part of the reverse merger in fiscal  increased accounts payable and accrued expenses of million as a result of an increased level of research and development spending related to our lead program and increased compensation and related costs  and  an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million from the receipt of an upfront license payment related to the collaboration arrangement with mitsubishi tanabe 
non cash items partially offsetting our net loss include depreciation and amortization of fixed assets of million  stock based compensation of million  and million from the revaluation of preferred stock warrants 
amortization related to the developed technology intangible asset contributed million to depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal  accounting for the majority of the year over year increase from fiscal we expect to continue to use cash in operations as we continue to seek to advance our orphan drug programs through clinical development and preclinical testing 
in addition  in the future  we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensors based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales  and other specified objectives 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  and was primarily a result of the purchase of available for sale investments of million 
our investment portfolio includes short term treasury securities  and was funded from our cash and cash equivalents balance in the fourth quarter of fiscal we had not received proceeds from either the sale of maturity of investments as of december  other uses of cash for investing activities included million for capital expenditures and million for the purchase of certain ip rights and other long term assets 
we anticipate cash spent on capital expenditures will continue to increase as we expand our internal production and development capabilities 
investing activities provided million of cash in fiscal  primarily as a result of million of cash received as part of the reverse merger with trimeris  partially offset by million of cash paid for capital expenditures 
financing activities provided cash of approximately million in fiscal  resulting from net cash received in secondary offerings of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
financing activities provided cash of approximately million for fiscal  primarily resulting from million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes  and million of proceeds from the exercises of stock options 
in march  we issued million of convertible notes 
in conjunction with the reverse merger  these notes were converted to common stock  and were no longer outstanding at december  this conversion did not have a cash impact 
supplemental disclosure regarding non cash investing and financing activities in fiscal  our capitalization structure was impacted by the reverse merger with trimeris 
in conjunction with the reverse merger  million of convertible preferred stock and million of convertible notes was converted into common stock 
we also extinguished a merger related liability of million through the issuance of common stock and issued common stock to the holders of warrants in a net settlement transaction 
although each of these transactions did not directly impact our cash balance at december   they are disclosed on our statement of cash flows 
funding requirements we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments balance at december  totaled million and we raised an additional million in january of  as discussed above 
we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments to continue our research and development programs and commercialization activities and to fulfill our planned operating goals 
in particular  our currently planned operating and capital requirements include the need for working capital to support our research and development activities for 
table of contents sebelipase alfa and other preclinical candidates that we are seeking to develop  and to fund our general and administrative and commercial costs and expenses 
we expect that we will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to sustain operations for more than the next two years 
our ability to finance our operations into the future and to generate revenues will depend heavily on our ability to obtain favorable results in the ongoing clinical trials of sebelipase alfa and to successfully develop and commercialize sebelipase alfa 
we expect that our significant sources of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be quarterly royalty payments from roche based on sales of fuzeon and additional collaboration revenues  if any 
net sales of fuzeon by roche have decreased in each of the last three years and are expected to continue to decline 
we may not be able to successfully enter into any new corporate collaborations and the timing  amount  and likelihood of us receiving additional payments under our current collaborations is highly uncertain 
as a result  we cannot assure that we will attain any further funding from collaborations or licensing arrangements 
there are a number of factors that may adversely affect our planned future capital requirements and accelerate our need for additional financing  many of which are beyond our control  including the following unanticipated costs in our research and development programs  the timing  receipt and amount of payments  if any  from current and potential future collaborators  the timing and amount of payments due to licensors of patent rights and technology used in our drug candidates  and unplanned costs to prepare  file  prosecute  maintain and enforce patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and technology license fees 
we may seek additional funding through debt or equity financings 
the fundraising environment for life science companies  in general  is highly volatile 
due to this and various other factors  including currently adverse general market conditions and the early stage status of our development pipeline  additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may be dilutive or otherwise adversely affect other rights of our stockholders 
we also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators  licensees or other third parties 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  whether through sales of debt or equity or through third party collaboration or license arrangements  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs  including some or all of our drug candidates 
contractual obligations and requirements as of december   our contractual obligations consisted primarily of operating leases for our headquarters and other facilities  contractual purchase obligations and to a lesser extent  royalty payments on licensed technology 
our contractual obligations were as follows at december  in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases capital expenditures purchase obligations royalty payments represents minimum lease payments for operating leases  including leases with remaining lease terms of under one year 
our new lease agreement for our headquarters is not included in the table above  however  the estimated minimum lease payments are disclosed in note see item properties and facilities and note for additional information about our operating leases 

table of contents represents our estimate of amounts related to leasehold improvements that will be paid under contractual arrangements existing at december  for the avoidance of doubt  the contractual obligations herein are dependent upon the third party providing the good or services under the contract and are cancelable 
purchase obligations primarily represent our estimate of amounts that will be paid to third parties  assuming continued development of sebelipase alfa and our pipeline  relating to contractual arrangements existing as of december  for the avoidance of doubt  the purchase obligations herein are dependent upon the third party providing goods or services under the contract and are cancelable 
the royalty payments listing above represent amounts expected to be owed through december  to pangenix and the university of minnesota 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the judgments  estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  research and development expenses  amortization of developed technology  and  income taxes the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipated  and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results 
revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
revenue under collaborations may include the receipt of non refundable license fees  payments based on achievement of development objectives  reimbursement of research and development costs and royalties on product sales 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services are performed or products are delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for deliverables and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized could be adversely affected 

table of contents royalty revenue royalty revenues are recognized in the period earned  based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
following the reverse merger  we received royalties due to the roche license agreement 
as part of the roche license agreement  roche has an exclusive license to manufacture and sell fuzeon worldwide and we receive royalty payments equal to of worldwide net sales of fuzeon occurring from and after january  under the roche license agreement  roche may deduct from its royalty payments to us of any royalties paid to third parties which are reasonably required to allow roche to sell fuzeon in a given country  including royalties paid to novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc novartis 
to calculate the royalty revenue paid to us  a distribution charge is deducted from roche s reported net sales  and we receive a royalty on the adjusted net sales amount 
collaboration and license revenue we recognize revenue related to collaboration and license agreements in accordance with the provisions of asc topics revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc topic 
in january  we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements for contracts entered into or materially modified after that date 
asu updates the previous multiple element revenue arrangements guidance 
the revised guidance primarily provides three significant changes it eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  it eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration  and it modifies the fair value requirements of eitf issue by providing best estimate of selling price besp in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor objective evidence vsoe  for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
we determine the selling price of a deliverable using the hierarchy as prescribed in asc topic based on vsoe  third party evidence tpe  or besp 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the element sold separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
tpe is determined based on third party evidence for a similar deliverable when sold separately and besp is the price which we would transact a sale if the elements of the collaboration and license agreements were sold on a stand alone basis 
we evaluate the above noted hierarchy when determining the fair value of a deliverable 
the process for determining vsoe  tpe  or besp involves significant judgment on our part and can include considerations of multiple factors such as estimated direct expenses and other costs and available data 
we evaluate all deliverables within an arrangement to determine whether or not they provided value on a stand alone basis 
based on this evaluation  the deliverables are separated into units of accounting 
the arrangement consideration that is fixed and determinable at the inception of the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the estimated selling price 
we may exercise significant judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting as well as in estimating the selling prices of such units of accounting 
for multiple element arrangements  including collaboration and license agreements  entered into prior to january   guidance required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the service or product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
under this guidance  if the fair value of all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue would be deferred until all of the items have been delivered or fair value was determined 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the relative performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level 
table of contents of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the relative performance method  as of each reporting period 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete its performance obligations under an arrangement 
effective january   we adopted asu no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition  which provides guidance on revenue recognition using the milestone method 
under the milestone method  a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is an event i that can be achieved based in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due 
the determination that a milestone is substantive is subject to considerable judgment and is made at the inception of the arrangement 
milestones are considered substantive when the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is i commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relates solely to past performance and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
the adoption of this standard did not impact our financial position or our results of operations for any prior period 
research and development research and development expenses primarily consist of internal labor  clinical and non clinical studies  materials and supplies  facilities  depreciation  third party costs for contracted services  manufacturing process improvement and testing costs  and other research and development related costs 
clinical development and manufacturing costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
we contract with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities and outsourced manufacturing activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flow 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred if no planned alternative future use exists for the technology and if the payment is not payment for future services 
we defer and capitalize our nonrefundable advance payments that are for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
amortization of developed technology we provide for amortization of developed technology  computed using an accelerated method according to the undiscounted expected cash flows to be received from the underlying assets  over an estimated useful life of years 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and operating loss carryforwards and credits 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to amounts we believe are more likely than not to be realized 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 other comprehensive income 
the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
we do not expect its adoption to have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest income is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in treasury backed money market funds and short term treasury securities 
in accordance with our investment policy  we do not invest in auction rate securities 
we estimate that a hypothetical and basis point movement in market interest rates would impact the fair value of our december  investment portfolio by million and million  respectively 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses are not recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold prior to maturity or if a reduction in fair value is determined to be a permanent impairment 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
foreign exchange market risk we currently have a subsidiary in the united kingdom and as a result  face exposure to movements in the foreign currency exchange rates of the british pound against the us dollar 
currently  our international operations do not represent a significant portion of our business  and as a result  we believe our exposure to foreign exchange risk is insignificant
