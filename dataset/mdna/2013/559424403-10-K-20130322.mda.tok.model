index item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of digital power control systems that are used to control motion and power primarily in material handling  elevator  and mining applications 
our digital power control systems serve the needs of selected niches of traditional and emerging markets that are becoming increasingly dependent on smart power 
we are north america largest independent supplier of digital drives  radio controls  software and accessories for industrial cranes and hoists  and we are also the largest independent supplier of digital dc motion control systems for elevators 
customers include most of the industrial crane and hoist companies in north america and the world leading elevator builders 
in addition  we have a growing range of products for motion control systems used in mining equipment 
we are focused on providing our customers cost effective power solutions that will improve efficiency  reduce costs  and save energy 
other trends in our served markets we believe we can capitalize on include the adoption of wireless control solutions  modernization and upgrading of installed equipment  and an increasing desire in our markets for added features  enhanced performance  and safer workplace environments 
we believe that with our focus on innovation and our application expertise  combined with strong brand name recognition  broad product offerings and sales channel capabilities  we are well positioned to grow our business by gaining share in both our served markets as well as in new markets 
our operations are located in north america  predominantly in menomonee falls  wisconsin  our company headquarters 
our product offerings for material handling applications include innovative power control systems  radio remote controls  and braking  collision avoidance  and electrification subsystems  sold primarily to oems of overhead cranes and hoists 
while we sell primarily to oems of overhead cranes and hoists  we spend a great deal of effort understanding the needs of end users to gain specification 
we can combine our products with engineered services to provide complete customer specific systems solutions 
a primary driver of our growth in this market is our ability to improve our customers operations and provide them with quantifiable  and in many cases  significant returns on invested capital 
our product offerings for elevator applications are comprised of highly integrated subsystems and drives used to control motion primarily in high rise  high speed elevator applications 
our products are sold mainly to elevator oems and we have a significant share of the available market for dc drives and subsystems used in high rise elevators 
we believe we have opportunities for growth in available elevator markets by introducing new energy saving product offerings for both ac and dc applications  expanding the breadth of our product offerings for lower performance ac applications  and using our new product offerings to expand geographically 
our product offerings for mining applications include drives used mainly in the underground coal mining industry 
we have been a leading supplier of ac and dc digital motion control systems to underground coal mining equipment manufacturers for over years 
we believe that global energy needs will continue to grow significantly for the foreseeable future  and part of that need will continue to be met by traditional coal based sources 
in addition  we intend to develop and introduce new products for hard rock and surface mining applications in an effort to reduce our reliance on the coal industry 
more recently  we developed and marketed power inverters for renewable energy applications  primarily for use in wind turbines 
these inverters convert dc power from renewable energy sources such as wind to utility grade ac power 
challenging conditions have persisted in renewable energy markets for the past several years  and these markets have been characterized by rapidly changing product requirements  high levels of investment  and declining sales and profitability 
we responded to the decline in our renewable energy sales by reducing our cost structure and writing down the value of our assets in that part of our business 
going forward  we intend to continue to support our existing installed based of inverters  but we don t intend to pursue new business opportunities in renewable energy  as we believe we have better growth opportunities in our traditional served markets 
we intend to continue to build on our competitive strengths in established material handling  elevator  and mining markets and continue to invest in research and development to expand our product portfolio aimed at penetrating growing markets for digital power based systems 
we intend to continue to pursue internal growth opportunities in our core product lines  seeking to increase our market share  enter new markets  and expand our current business model geographically 

index continuing operations we focus on a variety of key indicators to monitor our business performance 
these indicators include order rates  sales growth  gross profit margin  operating profit margin  net income  earnings per share  and working capital and cash flow measures 
these indicators are compared to our operating plans as well as to our prior year actual results  and are used to measure our success relative to our objectives 
our company objectives are to grow sales at least on a year over year basis  to achieve gross margins and operating profit margins  and to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our growth initiatives  our operations  and our obligations 
we delivered another solid year of operating performance despite some challenging and uncertain conditions 
our largest served markets  material handling and elevator  were relatively stable  and we grew our material handling sales year over year to more than million  our highest level ever 
offsetting that  we experienced deteriorating conditions during fiscal in our served energy markets  and our sales levels for both traditional mining products and renewable energy inverters declined year over year 
total company fiscal sales decreased to million from the same period last year  mainly due to lower sales of power inverters for renewable energy  which declined by nearly million year over year to less than million 
in addition  sales of control systems for mining applications totaled million  a decrease of more than in fiscal over the comparable period last year 
given our diminished prospects for future sales of renewable energy products  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided we will no longer pursue new opportunities in renewable energy going forward 
fiscal gross profit increased to million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales for the months ended december the improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects improvement in our sales mix  as we sold fewer low margin wind inverters during fiscal fiscal gross profit also includes an asset impairment charge of million related to a write down of our renewable energy fixed assets 
we reported pre tax income from operations of million  or of sales  in fiscal  comparable to prior year pre tax income from operations of million  despite the impairment charge and higher pension expense in fiscal in addition  our cash balances increased more than million during fiscal  as we prudently deployed our resources and effectively managed our assets 
in summary  our financial performance was quite strong during fiscal  and we entered well positioned and clearly focused on our traditional served markets 
current forecasts indicate the us economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace  and we believe overall economic conditions in most of our end markets remain healthy 
macro economic conditions remain dynamic and fragile  and as a result  it remains challenging to predict the duration or the magnitude of the current economic recovery  whether in the us overall or in the specific end markets we serve 
however  barring a significant decline in demand in our served markets  we expect that we can continue to grow our business through a combination of new product introductions  market share gains  and entry into new markets 
throughout  we intend to focus our development and marketing efforts on organic sales growth opportunities across all product lines  and are executing actions to prudently expand our reach into new end markets and geographical areas 
we also plan to continue to tightly control our operating expenses to optimize operating leverage and grow our income and cash flow 
discontinued operations certain expenses related to previously divested businesses have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes for all periods presented see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item 
expenses related to previously divested businesses have historically included certain environmental matters  asbestos claims and product liability claims see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item 
all of these issues relate to businesses we no longer own and most relate to indemnification agreements that we entered into when we divested those businesses 
going forward  our results of discontinued operations may include additional costs above those currently estimated and accrued related to previously divested businesses  mainly related to a power electronics business that we divested in october see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item 

index critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and judgments by management that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
such estimates are based upon historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable given known circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and update our estimates  and we believe the following discussion addresses our policies which are most critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations and which require our most complex judgments 
accounts receivable accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business 
we are subject to losses from uncollectable receivables in excess of our allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from customers inability to make required payments 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment patterns 
our total allowance includes a specific allowance based on identification of customers where we feel full payment is in doubt  as well as a general allowance calculated based on our historical losses on accounts receivable as a percentage of historical sales 
we believe that our methodology has been effective in accurately quantifying our allowance for doubtful accounts and do not anticipate changing our methodology in the future 
however  if the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
we believe that all appropriate allowances have been provided 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor  and factory overhead 
we identify potentially obsolete and excess inventory by evaluating overall inventory levels in relation to expected future requirements and market conditions  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and inventory valuation are recorded accordingly 
items with no usage for the past months and no expected future usage are considered obsolete  and are disposed of or fully reserved 
reserves for excess inventory are determined based upon historical and anticipated usage as compared to quantities on hand 
excess inventory is defined as inventory items with on hand quantities in excess of one year s usage and specified percentages are applied to the excess inventory value in determining the reserve 
our assumptions have not changed significantly in the past  and are not likely to change in the future 
we believe that our assumptions regarding inventory valuation have been accurate in the past and believe that all appropriate reserves for excess and obsolete inventory have been provided 
long lived assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment 
impairment charges are recorded in operating results when the undiscounted future expected cash flows derived from an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
given our diminished prospects for future sales of wind and solar inverters  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the impairment charge was comprised entirely of accelerated depreciation related to fixed assets used in the production and testing of inverters  and is included in cost of sales in the accompanying statement of operations for fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item 
we are required to perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill  and may be required to test more frequently in certain circumstances 
we have elected to perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
per accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and others  the best evidence of fair value are quoted prices in active markets 
accordingly  we believe that our market capitalization is the best indication of fair value 
no impairments were recognized in goodwill or other intangible assets during fiscal  transition period  or for fiscal years and pension benefits we sponsor a defined benefit plan that was frozen in which covers primarily former employees in the us the valuation of our pension plan requires the use of assumptions and estimates that attempt to anticipate future events to develop actuarial valuations of expenses  assets  and liabilities 
these assumptions include expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and mortality rates 

index we determine the expected return on plan assets based upon the overall expected long term rate of return over the period that benefits are expected to be paid 
this estimate considers the targeted allocation of pension plan assets among securities with various risk and return profiles  and incorporates historical data as well as anticipated economic and market conditions 
we estimated our long term expected rate of return on plan assets at for cost recognition purposes in fiscal year and transition period based on an updated analysis of future expectations of asset performance  past return results  and current and expected asset allocations  we have reduced our long term expected return on plan assets to for cost recognition purposes for fiscal the discount rate reflects the market for high quality fixed income debt instruments and is subject to change each year 
as of december   the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation was as compared to at january   reflecting the ongoing decline in interest rates that occurred throughout much of fiscal year we believe that the assumptions we used in valuing our pension plan are appropriate and reasonable  however  actual experience may differ from our assumptions 
actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses  and are recognized as increases or decreases in other comprehensive income or loss oci 
the amount accumulated in oci impacts future periodic pension expense through subsequent amortization of the gains and losses in accordance with the methods specified in asc topic  employers accounting for pensions asc 
as permitted under asc  we use the corridor approach to determine the aggregate amount of actuarial gains or losses that must be recognized  and we then amortize those gains or losses on a straight line basis over the average future life expectancy of our plan participants  due to the fact that all of our plan participants are considered inactive  as our plan is frozen 
deferred actuarial losses which will be amortized into earnings in future accounting periods totaled million at december  we contributed million to our pension plan in fiscal  and we currently expect to contribute approximately million in fiscal pension plan expense for fiscal is expected to decrease to approximately million from million in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item 
reserves for contingencies we periodically record the estimated impact of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
the accounting for such events is prescribed under asc topic  contingencies asc 
asc defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
asc does not permit the accrual of gain contingencies under any circumstances 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of uncertain events  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment and we use our internal expertise and outside experts  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and to assist in determining the amount or range of the loss 
income taxes we operate in several taxing jurisdictions and are subject to a variety of income and related taxes 
judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities 
we believe we have reasonably estimated our tax positions for all jurisdictions for all open tax periods 
however  it is possible that  upon closure of our tax periods  our final tax liabilities could differ from our estimates 
we record deferred income tax assets in tax jurisdictions where we generate losses for income tax purposes 
we also record valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets in accordance with asc topic  income taxes  when in our judgment  the deferred income tax assets will likely not be realized in the foreseeable future 
since fiscal  we have provided valuation reserves against our us deferred tax assets that result in a net deferred tax liability position 
a portion of our deferred tax liability relates to tax deductible amortization of goodwill that is no longer amortized for financial reporting purposes 
under applicable accounting rules  such deferred tax liabilities are considered to have an indefinite life and are therefore ineligible to be considered as a source of future taxable income in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

index results of operations for the twelve months ended december  fiscal year  compared with the twelve months ended january  unaudited net sales and gross profit net sales decreased to million for the twelve months ended december   from sales of million for the twelve months ended january  the decrease in net sales was due primarily to lower sales of power inverters for renewable energy applications  which decreased million year over year  and lower sales of products for mining applications  which decreased million 
these sales decreases were partially offset by higher sales of products for material handling applications  which increased by million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period last year 
net sales by primary market were as follows  in millions twelve months ended december  january  sales of sales sales of sales unaudited material handling elevator motion control energy systems renewable energy and mining total net sales gross profit for the twelve months ended december   increased to million of sales from million of sales in the comparable prior year period 
the increase in gross profit for the twelve months ended december   was primarily due to a favorable shift in our sales mix  with increased sales of relatively higher margin material handling products and decreased sales of lower margin renewable energy inverters  partially offset by asset impairment charges of million recorded in fiscal related to our renewable energy fixed assets 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of r d expense  pension expense  and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
r d expense was million for the twelve months ended december   or of sales  compared to r d expense of million for the twelve months ended january  the year over year decrease in r d expense was mainly due to fewer development projects related to products with renewable energy applications in fiscal pension expense for the twelve months ended december   increased to million from million in the same period last year  mainly due to increased amortization of actuarial losses resulting from continuing declining interest rates 
sg a expense was million  or of sales  for the twelve months ended december   compared to million  or of sales  for the twelve months ended january  selling expenses were million  or of sales  for the twelve months ended december   compared to million  or of sales  for the prior year comparable period 
the increase in selling expense was due to higher sales commission expense  increased payroll costs from headcount additions  and higher discretionary spending 
general and administrative g a expense decreased to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the twelve months ended january   mainly due to lower incentive compensation provisions 
income from operations income from operations was million for the twelve months ended december   comparable to income from operations for the twelve months ended january  provision for income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million for the twelve months ended december   and million for the twelve months ended january   mainly due to non cash deferred tax provisions of million and million recorded in those periods respectively  related to changes in deferred tax liabilities from goodwill amortization

index results of operations for fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales and gross profit net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was due primarily to higher sales of products for material handling applications of million and higher sales of products for energy delivery applications of million  primarily inverters for wind turbine applications 
net sales by market were as follows  in millions fiscal year ended july  june  sales of sales sales of sales material handling elevator motion control energy systems renewable energy and mining total net sales gross profit in fiscal increased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal the million increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily due to sales of relatively higher margin material handling products and increased sales of wind power inverters 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of r d expense  pension expense  and sg a expenses 
r d expense was million in fiscal  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the increased spending in r d expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects higher payroll expenses and development costs incurred in new product introductions 
pension expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal due to higher than expected returns on assets realized in fiscal as well as a decrease in the interest cost component of pension expense due to declining interest rates 
sg a expense was million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal selling expenses were million  or of sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in selling expenses was due to higher commissions of million  increased payroll costs from headcount additions in fiscal  and higher discretionary spending

the remainder of our provision or benefit for income taxes is comprised of provisions or benefit for 
index income taxes on our pretax operating results in canada see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item 
income loss from continuing operations in fiscal  we recorded income from continuing operations of million  or per share  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million in fiscal  or per share  on a diluted basis 
loss from discontinued operations we recorded a loss from discontinued operations in fiscal of million  or a loss per share on a diluted basis compared to a fiscal loss from discontinued operations of million  or a loss per share on a diluted basis 
our loss from discontinued operations in fiscal related entirely to previously divested businesses  comprised mainly of legal and professional fees incurred in various matters 
our loss from discontinued operations in fiscal included a loss of million on the september disposal of our telecom power systems business  and costs of million loss related to previously divested businesses  comprised mainly of legal and professional fees incurred in various environmental matters 
net income loss we recorded net income in fiscal of million  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to a net loss in fiscal of million  or a loss per share  on a diluted basis 
liquidity and capital resources our unrestricted cash and cash equivalent balance increased million during fiscal  from million at january   to million at december  restricted cash balances remained unchanged during fiscal at million 
the primary source of cash during fiscal was income from continuing operations of million  which reflects non cash charges totaling million for depreciation  amortization  asset impairment  pension  stock compensation and deferred income tax provisions 
in addition  we received a payment of million during fiscal from a settlement agreement we entered into to resolve a long standing legal issue see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item 
the primary uses of cash in fiscal were million in contributions to our defined benefit pension plan  million from net increases in operating assets and liabilities  and million for capital expenditures 
most of the changes in our operating assets and liabilities were not volume related  but rather were due to changes in velocity measurements 
our accounts receivable decreased during fiscal by million  mainly due to a reduction in our accounts receivable days sales outstanding  which decreased as of the end of fiscal to days from days at the end of transition period inventories increased during fiscal by million  mainly due to a lower inventory turnover rate from lower renewable energy sales as compared to the period ended january  in addition  current liabilities decreased during fiscal by million  mainly due to lower accounts payable balances  as payable days outstanding decreased to days at the end of fiscal from the prior year figure of days in accounts payable 
while we may make further investments to increase capacity and improve efficiency  we do not anticipate that capital expenditures during fiscal will exceed million 
the expected amount of capital expenditures could change depending upon changes in revenue levels  our financial condition and the general economy 
in december  we entered into an agreement with associated bank  na associated bank providing for a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility 
borrowings under the revolving facility bore interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus  with borrowing levels determined by a borrowing base formula as defined in the agreement  based on the level of eligible accounts receivable 
the revolving facility also supported the issuance of letters of credit  placed certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions  and included covenants which required minimum operating profit levels and limited annual capital expenditures 
borrowings under the revolving facility at that time were collateralized by our accounts receivable and inventory 

index we have subsequently entered into several amendments to the revolving facility  mainly to extend the maturity date of the revolving facility  to broaden the security interest of associated bank to collateralize all of our assets  and to establish or modify certain covenants with which we must comply under the terms of the amended revolving facility 
in december  we entered into the most recent fourth amendment to the revolving facility with associated bank  the purpose of which was to i extend the maturity date of the revolving facility to june   ii increase the commitment amount of associated bank to million  iii establish minimum adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization requirements for the three month periods ending december   through march   and iv establish maximum cash amounts we can contribute to our defined benefit pension plan during the term of the revolving facility 
there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving facility as of december  we are currently in compliance with all covenants of the revolving credit facility  as amended 
primarily as a result of the decline in interest rates over the past decade  the accumulated benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plan currently exceeds plan assets 
we contributed million to our pension plan in december following the divestiture of our power electronics business  and subsequently have made contributions to the plan aggregating million from april through december  including nearly million during fiscal these contributions have been funded by cash generated from operations and existing cash on hand 
estimated future contributions to achieve funded status  as measured using current actuarial assumptions  are projected to be approximately million  relatively significant given the company s current size and cash flow 
estimated pension contributions for fiscal are currently projected at million 
actual future contribution amounts will likely vary from current estimated future contributions  depending on future interest rate levels  values in equity and fixed income markets  and the level and timing of additional interim contributions we may make to plan assets 
based upon current plans and business conditions  we believe that current cash balances and internally generated cash flows will be sufficient to fund anticipated operational needs  capital expenditures  required pension plan contributions  and other commitments over the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities as of december  summary of contractual obligations and commitments future payments due under contractual obligations of our continuing operations as of december   were as follows in thousands less than year to years to years more than years total pension funding obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total pension funding amounts in the table above are based on current regulations and actuarial estimates as of december   and are not discounted 
the net present value of our future pension funding obligations  discounted at a rate of the rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation at december  total approximately million 
estimated pension funding obligation amounts could vary  depending on future interest rate levels  values in equity and fixed income markets  changes in mortality rates  or changes in pension funding legislation that may be enacted in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the fair value of our debt was zero at december  however  we do have significant pension liabilities and funding obligations which vary as interest rates change 
we used an average interest rate of in determining our aggregate pension funding obligations of approximately million as of december  see summary of contractual obligations and commitments table under item 
a hypothetical increase of basis points from the average interest rate used in the 
index calculation would reduce our aggregate pension funding obligation to approximately million at december  similarly  a hypothetical decrease of basis points would increase our aggregate pension funding obligation to approximately million at december foreign currency exchange rates we generally do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates  but we may selectively enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain exposures 
gains and losses on these non us currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure 
we did not have any foreign currency contracts  or hedge instruments or contracts  outstanding at december   or january
