item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
our subsidiaries are listed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in acquiring  developing and producing oil and natural gas 
we presently own producing and non producing properties located primarily in texas  oklahoma  west virginia  the gulf of mexico  new mexico  colorado and louisiana 
in addition  we own a substantial amount of well servicing equipment 
all of our oil and gas properties and interests are located in the united states 
assets in our principal focus areas include mature properties with long lived reserves and significant development opportunities as well as newer properties with development and exploration potential 
we believe our balanced portfolio of assets and our ongoing hedging program position us well for both the current commodity price environment and future potential upside as we develop our attractive resource opportunities 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations and our credit facility 
we attempt to assume the position of operator in all acquisitions of producing properties and will continue to evaluate prospects for leasehold acquisitions and for exploration and development operations in areas in which we own interests 
we continue to actively pursue the acquisition of producing properties 
in order to diversify and broaden our asset base  we will consider acquiring the assets or stock in other entities and companies in the oil and gas business 
our main objective in making any such acquisitions will be to acquire income producing assets so as to build stockholder value through consistent growth in our oil and gas reserve base on a cost efficient basis 
our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and gas  the success of our acquisition and drilling activities and the operational performance of our producing properties 
we use derivative instruments to manage our commodity price risk 
this practice may prevent us from receiving the full advantage of any increases in oil and gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the derivative agreements and subjects us to the credit risk of the counterparties to such agreements 
since all of our derivative contracts are accounted for under mark to market accounting  we expect continued volatility in gains and losses on mark to market derivative contracts in our consolidated statement of operations as changes occur in the nymex price indices 
critical accounting estimates proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the prior year 
excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income  our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices or changes in working capital accounts 
our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance but may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
our realized oil and gas prices vary due to world political events  supply and demand of products  product storage levels  and weather patterns 
we sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate price volatility we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production through the use of derivatives 
if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to expend additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the successful wells and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to access sufficient additional capital through additional bank financing 
the company has in place both a stock repurchase program and a limited partnership interest repurchase program 
spending under these programs in was million 
the company expects continued spending under these programs in as of march   the company maintains a credit facility totaling million  with a borrowing base of million 
the bank reviews the borrowing base semi annually and  at their discretion  may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit and we are subject to certain financial and operational covenants defined in the agreement 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants 
if we do not comply with these covenants on a continuing basis  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable 
it is our goal to increase our oil and gas reserves and production through the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
we continued our drilling program in our west texas and mid continent regions 
during  we intend to drill a total of approximately gross net wells  primarily in the west texas area  at a net cost of million 
we also continue to explore and consider opportunities to further expand our oilfield servicing revenues through additional investment in field service equipment 
however  the majority of our capital spending is discretionary  and the ultimate level of expenditures will be dependent on our assessment of the oil and gas business environment  the number and quality of oil and gas prospects available  the market for oilfield services  and oil and gas business opportunities in general 

table of contents results of operations and compared we reported net income for of million  or per share 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
net income increased in by million or  primarily due to decreased depreciation and depletion expenses and decreases in net income attributable to non controlling interests partially offset by decreased operating revenues and an increase lease operating and income tax expenses 
depreciation and depletion decreased by million in as compared to primarily associated with offshore properties as our offshore properties enter into the last phase of their productive lives and were plugged and abandoned during operating revenues decreased by million in as compared to largely due to gains on derivative instruments associated with early settlement transactions and recovery of gas transportation revenues recognized in the significant components of net income are discussed below 
oil and gas sales decreased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  crude oil and natural gas sales vary due to changes in volumes of production sold and realized commodity prices 
our realized prices at the well head decreased an average of per barrel  or less than on crude oil and per mcf  or on natural gas during as compared to our crude oil production increased by  barrels  or from  barrels for the year ended december  to  barrels for the year ended december  our natural gas production decreased by mmcf  or from  mmcf for the year ended december  to  mmcf for the year ended december  the net increase in crude oil production volumes are a result of continued drilling success in west texas and the gulf coast regions as we place new wells into production partially offset by the natural decline of existing properties 
the natural gas volume decreases are primarily due to the decline of the primary natural gas producing offshore properties  slightly offset by natural gas production from wells in the west texas region recently placed into production 
the following table summarizes the primary components of production volumes and average sales prices realized for the years ended december  and excluding realized gains and losses from derivatives 
year ended december  increase decrease amount percent barrels of oil produced average price received excluding the impact of derivatives oil revenue in s mcf of gas produced average price received excluding the impact of derivatives gas revenue in s total oil gas revenue in s realized net gains on derivative instruments include net gains of million on the settlements of crude oil and natural gas derivatives for the year ended december  during  we unwound and monetized crude oil swaps with original settlement dates from january through december for net proceeds of million 
the million gain associated with these early settlement transactions is included in realized gain on derivative instruments for the year ended december  during  we unwound and monetized 
table of contents crude oil swaps and collars with original settlement dates from september through december for net proceeds of million and natural gas swaps with original settlement dates from october through december for net proceeds of million 
the million gain associated with these early settlement transactions is included in realized gain on derivative instruments for the year ended december  oil and gas prices received including the impact of derivatives but excluding the early settlement transactions were year ended december  increase decrease amount percent oil price gas price we do not apply hedge accounting to any of our commodity based derivatives thus changes in the fair market value of commodity contracts held at the end of a reported period  referred to as mark to market adjustments  are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as oil and natural gas prices remain volatile  mark to market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in unrealized gains 
this unrealized gain primarily relates to held crude oil fixed swaps and collars associated with future production due to a decrease in crude oil futures market prices between january  and december  field service income decreased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease in field service income is largely due to gas transportation revenues recovered in during  we recognized million in gas transportation revenues associated with approvals for the recovery of additional cost of our pipelines associated with our offshore properties 
lease operating expense increased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to higher salt water disposal costs  production taxes and chemical expenses associated with new wells coming on line from the recent drilling success in west texas  partially offset by decreased operating expenses on the offshore properties and decreased expensed workovers across all districts during field service expense increased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  field service expenses primarily consist of salaries and vehicle operating expenses which remained relatively flat with services and utilization of the equipment during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion on discounted liabilities decreased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to decreased depletion rates recognized during associated with offshore properties as our offshore properties enter into the last phase of their productive lives and were plugged and abandoned during general and administrative expense increased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this slight increase is largely due to increased personnel costs in the largest component of these personnel costs was salaries  however engineering consultants  rent and employee related taxes and insurance also contributed to the increase 

table of contents gain on sale and exchange of assets of million for the year ended december  consists of sales of non essential field service equipment whereas the gain on sale and exchange of assets of million for the year ended december  consists of million related to sales of non producing acreage and non core producing properties combined with million related to undeveloped acreage sold into a joint venture 
interest expense decreased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease includes the reduction of interest expense of million for the year ended december  associated with interest on the subordinated credit facility with a related party private lender which was paid off in june the decrease is partially offset with a net increase of million for the year ended december  related to interest on outstanding bank debt 
the average interest rate paid on outstanding bank borrowings subject to interest during and were and  respectively 
as of december  and  the total outstanding borrowings were million and million  respectively 
a provision for income taxes of million  or an effective tax rate of was recorded for the year ended december  verses a provision of million  or an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  our provision for income taxes varies from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to percentage depletion 
we are entitled to percentage depletion on certain of our wells  which is calculated without reference to the basis of the property 
to the extent that such depletion exceeds a property s basis it creates a permanent difference  which lowers our effective rate
