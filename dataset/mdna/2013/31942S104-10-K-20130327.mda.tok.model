item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general as the holding company for the bank  the company conducts its business primarily through the bank 
the bank s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the cost of its interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits  retail repurchase agreements and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
the bank s net income is also affected by  among other things  fee income  provisions for loan losses  operating expenses and income tax provisions 
the bank s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government legislation and policies concerning monetary and fiscal affairs  housing and financial institutions and the intended actions of the regulatory authorities 
management uses various indicators to evaluate the company s financial condition and results of operations  including the following net income and earnings per share net income attributable to the company was million  or per share for compared to million  or per share for however  had the voluntary early retirement program discussed below not been established in  net income would have been million  or per share for  resulting in increases of and  respectively 
return on average assets and return on average equity return on average assets for was compared to for  and return on average equity for was compared to for excluding the net effect of the voluntary early retirement program would increase the return on average assets for to and the return on average equity to  resulting in increases of and  respectively 
efficiency ratio the company s efficiency ratio defined as noninterest expenses divided by net interest income plus noninterest income was for compared to for excluding the expense associated with the voluntary early retirement program  the efficiency ratio would have been for which compares very favorably to our peers 
asset quality net loan charge offs decreased from million for to  for in addition  total nonperforming assets consisting of nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate decreased from million  or of total assets at december  to million  or of total assets at december  the allowance for loan losses was of total loans and of nonperforming loans at december  compared to of total loans and at december  shareholder return total shareholder return  including the increase in the company s stock price from at december  to at december  and dividends of per share  was for management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company and the bank 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made  and different estimates that the company reasonably could have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under generally accepted accounting principles 
significant accounting policies  including the impact of recent accounting pronouncements  are discussed in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are described below 
allowances for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans  value of collateral  and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio  past loss experience  current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  the occ  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would adversely affect earnings 
note and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements describe the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses as well as changes to the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses during the year ended december  valuation methodologies 
in the ordinary course of business  management applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities that often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when active markets do not exist for the items being valued 
generally  in evaluating various assets for potential impairment  management compares the fair value to the carrying value 
quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets  such as certain investment securities 
for investment securities for which quoted market prices are not available  the company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service 
however  for those items for which market based prices do not exist and an independent pricing service is not readily available  management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items 
examples of these items include goodwill and other intangible assets  foreclosed and other repossessed assets  impaired loans  stock based compensation and certain other financial investments 
the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could have material positive or negative effects on the company s results of operations 
note and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements describe the methodologies used to determine the fair value of investment securities  impaired loans  foreclosed real estate and other assets 
there were no changes in the valuation techniques and related inputs used during the year ended december  
table of contents results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net income 
net income attributable to the company was million per share diluted  weighted average common shares outstanding of  as adjusted for the year ended december  compared to million per share diluted  weighted average common shares outstanding of  as adjusted for the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income decreased  or  from million for to million for primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate spread  the difference between the average tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by an increase in interest earning assets 
total interest income decreased from million for to million for this decrease was primarily a result of the average tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets decreasing from for to for partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets from million for to million for interest on loans decreased million as a result of the average tax equivalent yield on loans decreasing from for to for and the average balance of loans decreasing from million for to million for interest on investment securities including federal home loan bank stock decreased  for compared to due to the average tax equivalent yield of investment securities decreasing from for to for  partially offset by the average balance of investment securities increasing from million for to million for management continued to focus loan origination efforts on commercial and consumer loans during the majority of the new commercial loans originated during were adjustable rate loans 
adjustable rate loans comprised of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to at the end of market interest rates remained at near historic lows throughout  so as loans and investment securities mature or pay down they are replaced with lower yielding new loan originations and investment purchases 
total interest expense decreased million  from million for to million for  due to a decrease in the average cost of funds from for to for  and a decrease in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities from million for to million for interest expense on deposits decreased from million for to million for as a result of a decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits  which decreased from for to for and a decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits from million for to million for interest expense on federal home loan bank advances decreased from  for to  for the average cost of federal home loan bank advances decreased from for to for  and the average balance of federal home loan bank advances decreased from million for to million for  due to scheduled pay downs of advances 
for further information  see average balance sheets below 
the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and changes in rates for and are shown in the schedule captioned rate volume analysis included herein 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for compared to million for the consistent application of management s allowance methodology resulted in a decrease in the provision for loan losses for compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in net charge offs 
net charge offs decreased when comparing the two periods  from million for to  for the provisions were recorded to bring the allowance to the level determined in applying the allowance methodology after reduction for net charge offs during the year and to allow for inherent loss exposure due to weakened general economic conditions such as depreciating collateral values  job losses and continued pressures on household budgets in the bank s market area 

table of contents provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to maintain the total allowance for loan losses at a level considered reasonable by management to provide for probable known and inherent loan losses based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio  including the nature of the portfolio  credit concentrations  trends in historical loss experience  specified impaired loans and economic conditions 
although management uses the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions that may be beyond the bank s control 
while the bank maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that it considers adequate to provide for estimated losses  there can be no assurance that further additions will not be made to the allowance for loan losses and that actual losses will not exceed the estimated amounts 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased  to million for compared to million for gains on the sale of loans increased  when comparing the two periods primarily due to the low rate environment which has led to increased refinancing activity  and the continuing recovery of the local housing market 
service charges on deposit accounts also increased  for compared to due to an increase in atm and debit card fee income 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased  or  to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to increases of  in compensation and benefits expenses and  in data processing expenses 
the increase in compensation and benefits expenses was primarily due to the voluntary early retirement program which was effective september  fourteen employees participated in the program which resulted in a pre tax charge to earnings of  on september  this was partially offset by the pre tax savings of  the company recognized during the quarter ended december  due to the overall reduction in compensation and benefits following the voluntary retirements 
the increase in data processing expenses was primarily due to an increase in atm processing fees and more customers using alternate delivery channels for traditional banking services 
income tax expense 
the company recognized income tax expense of million effective tax rate of for  compared to million effective tax rate of for the increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate for is primarily due to a decrease in tax exempt income

table of contents comparison of financial condition at december  and total assets increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to increases in securities available for sale and net loans 
net loans increased from million at december  to million at december  the primary contributing factor to the increase in net loans was an increase of million in commercial real estate loans 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in residential mortgage loans as the bank continued to sell the majority of newly originated residential mortgage loans in the secondary market 
the bank originated million in new residential mortgages for sale in the secondary market during compared to million in these loans were originated and funded by the bank and sold in the secondary market 
of this total  million paid off existing loans in the bank s portfolio 
originating mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market allows the bank to better manage its interest rate risk  while offering a full line of mortgage products to prospective customers 
in addition to commercial mortgage loans  construction loans also increased by million during while commercial business loans decreased by million during the year 
securities available for sale  at fair value  consisting primarily of u 
s 
agency mortgage backed obligations  u 
s 
agency notes and bonds  and municipal obligations  increased million  from million at december  to million at december  purchases of securities available for sale totaled million in these purchases were offset by maturities of million  principal repayments of million and sales of million 
the bank invests excess cash in securities that provide safety  liquidity and yield 
accordingly  we purchase mortgage backed securities to provide cash flow for loan demand and deposit changes  we purchase federal agency notes for short term yield and low risk  and municipals are purchased to improve our tax equivalent yield focusing on longer term profitability 
the investment in securities held to maturity  consisting of us agency mortgage backed securities  decreased from  at december  to  at december  due to principal repayments of  cash and cash equivalents increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase is due primarily to increases in interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold as a result of increases in deposit accounts during total deposits increased  from million at december  to million at december  noninterest bearing demand deposits increased to million at december  interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts each increased million during  while money market accounts and time deposits decreased million and million  respectively  during the period 
the increase in interest bearing demand deposits is primarily due to normal fluctuations in the balances of operating accounts of public entities  such as counties  cities and school corporations 
time deposits have decreased as some customers are unwilling to lock into long term commitments while interest rates are at their current low levels 
federal home loan bank borrowings decreased million from million at december  to million at december  no new advances were drawn during the year while principal payments on advances totaled million during retail repurchase agreements  which represent overnight borrowings from business and local municipal deposit customers  increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to normal balance fluctuations 
total stockholders equity attributable to the company increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase is primarily the result of retained net income of million and an increase in net unrealized gains on available for sale securities of  partially offset by treasury stock purchases of  during the company repurchased shares of its stock at a weighted average price of per share 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares of the  shares authorized by the board of directors under the current stock repurchase program which was announced in august and  shares since the original repurchase program began in 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk including commitments to extend credit under existing lines of credit and commitments to originate loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit and interest rate risk are summarized as follows at december  in thousands commitments to originate new loans undisbursed portion of construction loans unfunded commitments to extend credit under existing commercial and personal lines of credit standby letters of credit the company does not have any special purpose entities  derivative financial instruments or other forms of off balance sheet financing arrangements 
commitments to originate new loans or to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
most equity line commitments are for a term of five to years and commercial lines of credit are generally renewable on an annual basis 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amounts of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  are based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes information regarding the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands deposits federal home loan bank advances retail repurchase agreements operating lease obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the ability of a financial institution to generate sufficient cash flow to fund current loan demand  meet deposit withdrawals and pay operating expenses 
the bank s primary sources of funds are new deposits  proceeds from loan repayments and prepayments and proceeds from the maturity of securities 
the bank may also borrow from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
while loan repayments and maturities of securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  general economic conditions and competition 
at december   the bank had cash and interest bearing deposits with banks of million and securities available for sale with a fair value of million 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank of indianapolis and collateral eligible for repurchase agreements 
the bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
at december   the bank had total commitments to extend credit of million 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the bank had certificates of deposit scheduled to mature within one year of million 
historically  the bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature 
the company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  the company requires funds to pay any dividends to its shareholders and to repurchase any shares of its common stock 
the company s primary source of income is dividends received from the bank 
the amount of dividends the bank may declare and pay to the company in any calendar year  without the receipt of prior approval from the occ but with prior notice to the occ  cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income as defined for the preceding two calendar years 
at december   the company on an unconsolidated basis had liquid assets of  the bank is required to maintain specific amounts of capital pursuant to occ regulations 
as of december  the bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements which were effective as of such date with tangible capital to adjusted total assets  tier i capital to risk weighted assets and risk based capital to risk weighted assets ratios of  and  respectively 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of the financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets an d liabilities will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility  or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes 

table of contents the company s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates by operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity 
the company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company has developed strategies to manage its liquidity  shorten its effective maturities of certain interest earning assets and decrease the interest rate sensitivity of its asset base 
management has sought to decrease the average maturity of its assets by emphasizing the origination of short term commercial and consumer loans  all of which are retained by the company for its portfolio 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes the use of retail deposits  compared to brokered deposits reduces the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does the company engage in hedging activities or purchase high risk derivative instruments 
furthermore  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
potential cash flows  sales  or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities  especially those that earn or pay interest  are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits  extending loans and investing in investment securities 
many factors affect the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  historical pricing relationships  and re pricing characteristics of financial instruments 
the company s earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
an element in the company s ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a net interest income at risk simulation to model the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet and to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the company 
the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income over a one year horizon 
the model assumes a semi static balance sheet and measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical changes in interest rates over twelve months and provides no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movements 
the scenarios include prepayment assumptions  changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates in order to capture the impact from re pricing  yield curve  option  and basis risks 
results of the company s simulation modeling  which assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates  project that the company s net interest income could change as follows over a one year horizon  relative to our base case scenario  based on december  financial information 
the company implemented the net interest income at risk simulation during the quarter ended september  and therefore does not have comparable information as of december  at december  immediate change one year horizon in the level of interest rates dollar change percent change dollars in thousands bp bp bp static bp 
table of contents at december   the company s simulated exposure to an increase in interest rates shows that an immediate and sustained increase in rates of would increase the company s net interest income by  or  over a one year horizon compared to a flat interest rate scenario 
furthermore  rate increases of and would cause net interest income to increase by and  respectively 
alternatively  an immediate and sustained decrease in rates of would decrease the company s net interest income by  or  over a one year horizon compared to a flat interest rate scenario 
the company also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by net interest income at risk modeling 
therefore  the company also uses an economic value of equity eve interest rate sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate the impact of its interest rate risk on earnings and capital 
this is measured by computing the changes in net eve for its cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
eve modeling involves discounting present values of all cash flows for on and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios and provides no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movements 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the company s eve and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
the amount of base case eve and its sensitivity to shifts in interest rates provide a measure of the longer term re pricing and option risk in the balance sheet 
results of the company s simulation modeling  which assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates  project that the company s eve could change as follows  relative to the company s base case scenario  based on december  financial information 
at december  immediate change economic value of equity economic value of equity as a in the level dollar dollar percent percent of present value of assets of interest rates amount change change eve ratio change dollars in thousands bp bp bp   bp bp   bp static  bp bp   bp the previous table indicates that at december   the company would expect a decrease in its eve in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase in prevailing interest rates  and would expect an increase in its eve in the event of a sudden and sustained basis point decrease in prevailing interest rates 
the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect the company s net interest income and eve 
for this reason  the company models many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes 
therefore  as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables and it is recognized that the model outputs are not guarantees of actual results 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates of deposit could deviate significantly from those assumed in the modeling scenarios
