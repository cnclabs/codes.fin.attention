overview american woodmark corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets 
its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers  major builders and home manufacturers and through a network of independent dealers and distributors 
at april   the company operated manufacturing facilities and service centers across the country 
during the company s fiscal year that ended on april  fiscal  the company experienced improving housing market conditions for the first time since the housing market downturn that began in a number of positive factors evidenced the improving housing market  including creation of approximately million private sector jobs in the us during the company s fiscal years and according to the us department of labor  a improvement in gross private residential fixed investment reported by the us department of commerce during the most recent four quarters through the first quarter of calendar  as compared with the same period one year ago  increases in total housing starts and single family housing starts during the company s fiscal of and  respectively  as compared to the company s fiscal  according to the us department of commerce  the median price of existing homes sold in the us improved for the first time in years  rising by during the company s fiscal  according to data provided by the national association of realtors  consumer confidence  as reported by the university of michigan  averaged higher during the company s fiscal than in its prior fiscal year  and cabinet sales  as reported by members of the kitchen cabinet manufacturers association kcma  increased by during fiscal  suggesting an increase in both new construction and remodeling sales of cabinets 
faced with an improving but still relatively subdued remodeling market  the company s largest remodeling customers and competitors continued to utilize an elevated level of sales promotions in the company s product category during fiscal to boost sales  although a noticeable easing occurred in the second half of fiscal the company strives to maintain its promotional levels in line with market activity  with a goal of remaining competitive 
the company experienced promotional levels during fiscal that were lower than those experienced in its prior fiscal year 
the company s remodeling sales increased at a high single digit pace during fiscal in a remodeling market that appears to have improved by a bit less than that level 
the company increased its net sales by during fiscal the company realized strong sales gains in its new construction channel during fiscal  where sales increased by more than  significantly outpacing the improvement in single family housing starts 
management believes this result  combined with the company s increased remodeling sales  indicates the company realized market share gains in both of its sales channels during fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the company announced several initiatives designed to reduce its cost base the restructuring  including the permanent closure of two manufacturing plants  the decision to sell a previously closed manufacturing facility  and the realignment of its retirement program  including the freezing of its pension plans 
all of these initiatives were completed either prior to or just after the beginning of the company s fiscal  and restructuring charges related to these actions have been reflected in the company s results during both years 
gross margin for fiscal was  significantly improved from in fiscal the increase in the company s gross margin rate was driven by reductions in the labor and overhead costs associated with the company s restructuring activities  the beneficial impact of increased sales volume and the absence of the prior year s inventory write down  which more than offset the impact of rising materials costs 
the company recorded restructuring charges of million pre tax and million after tax during fiscal and million pre tax and million after tax during fiscal in connection with these initiatives 
because the bulk of these restructuring efforts have been completed  the company expects that its future out of pocket costs will be nominal 
the company sold a previously closed plant during fiscal and continues to include in other assets at an aggregate million book value the other two plants held for sale that were included in the restructuring 
the company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
the company had a history of profitable operations for consecutive years  from to  followed by losses that coincided with the industry downturn from to as of april   the company had total deferred tax assets of million  down from million at april  growth in the company s deferred tax assets in recent fiscal years resulted primarily from growth in its defined benefit pension liabilities and the impact of its recent losses prior to fiscal the company earned sufficient net income during fiscal to fully utilize its federal net operating loss carryforward 
to fully realize these net deferred tax assets  the company will need to  among other things  substantially reduce its net unfunded pension obligation of million at april  the company took definitive actions when it froze its pension plans as part of the restructuring to enhance the probability that this objective is achieved in the future 
the company resumed the funding of its pension plans during fiscal year  and expects to continue funding these plans for the foreseeable future  which will reduce both its unfunded pension plan obligation and its deferred tax asset 
these actions  coupled with the recent improvement in the us housing market and the company s continued ability to grow its sales at a faster rate than its competitors  have enabled the company to generate net income and reduce its deferred tax assets and unfunded pension obligation during fiscal the company believes that the positive evidence of the housing industry improvement  coupled with the benefits from the company s successful restructuring and continued market share gains have already driven a return to profitability that is expected to continue  and that the combined impact of these positive factors outweighs the negative factor of the company s previous losses 
accordingly  management has concluded it is more likely than not that the company will realize its deferred tax assets 
the company also regularly assesses its long lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred 
the company has concluded that none of the long lived assets pertaining to its manufacturing plants or any of its other long lived assets were impaired as of april  results of operations fiscal years ended april in thousands vs 
percent change vs 
percent change net sales gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses interest expense net sales net sales were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared with fiscal overall unit volume for fiscal was higher than in fiscal  which management believes was driven primarily by the company s increased market share 
average revenue per unit increased in fiscal  driven by improvements in the company s product mix 
net sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal overall unit volume for fiscal was higher than in fiscal  which management believes was driven primarily by the company s increased market share 
average revenue per unit increased during fiscal  driven primarily by improvements in product mix 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal as compared with in fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin was due primarily to the beneficial impact of higher sales volume and labor and overhead cost savings associated with the company s two plant closures in april and may of this favorability was partially offset by an increase in material costs 
specific changes and additional information included labor and overhead costs improved by as a percentage of net sales compared with the prior fiscal year  as the combination of the increased sales volume and the plant closures caused both a decrease in overhead costs and improved absorption of fixed overhead costs  while labor costs became increasingly more efficient throughout fiscal as productivity gains were realized following the plant closures  materials and freight costs increased as a percentage of net sales by during fiscal as compared with fiscal  driven primarily by inflationary pressures in finishing materials  lumber  cartons  plywood  particleboard and paint  as well as from increased levels of outsourcing following the recent plant closures  and sales promotion costs improved by of net sales during fiscal compared with the prior year  as a result of both an increased proportion of new construction sales to the company s total sales and reduced promotional activity 
sales promotions that involved the use of free products or cash reimbursements back to the company s large remodeling customers were deducted from gross margin as opposed to being classified as operating expenses 
during fiscal  the company s gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to from in fiscal increased sales volume in fiscal created improved labor efficiencies and more favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs  which were partially offset by increased sales promotion costs  material costs and diesel fuel 
specific changes and additional information included labor and overhead costs improved by as a percentage of net sales during fiscal compared with the prior fiscal year  as increased sales volume caused increased productivity of direct labor and absorption of fixed overhead costs  materials and freight costs increased as a percentage of net sales by during fiscal as compared with fiscal  driven primarily by inflationary pressures in finishing materials  lumber  cartons  imported components  and diesel fuel  and sales promotion costs increased by of net sales during fiscal  as the company chose to remain competitive with competitors promotional offerings to drive sales growth in a challenging market 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses in fiscal were of net sales  compared with of net sales in fiscal selling and marketing costs decreased by despite a increase in net sales 
the improvement in sales and marketing costs in relation to net sales was due to reduced spending on product launch costs and cost reductions related to the company s retirement plan changes  which were offset in part by increased sales compensation and staffing costs related to the company s increased sales levels 
selling and marketing expenses were of net sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal cost savings from lower marketing collateral and branding costs  as well as reductions in product display costs more than offset the increases in employee compensation and travel costs incurred by the company in fiscal general administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million or during fiscal the increase in cost was entirely related to increased pay for performance compensation 
however  g a costs declined to of net sales in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased by million  or  compared with fiscal and represented of net sales  compared with of net sales for fiscal the majority of the cost increase was related to increased pay for performance compensation 
effective income tax rates the company generated pre tax income of million during fiscal  including million of restructuring charges 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the higher effective tax rate was the result of relatively consistent amounts of permanent tax differences in relation to the net income generated in fiscal compared with the net loss generated in the prior year 
outlook for fiscal the company tracks several metrics  including but not limited to housing starts  existing home sales  mortgage interest rates  new jobs growth  gdp growth and consumer confidence  which it believes are leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry 
the company believes that housing prices finally bottomed during its fiscal and have begun what it expects will be a multi year improvement  driven by employment growth and a resumption of growth in new household formation 
however  because the number of homeowners still owing more than what their homes are worth remains at historically high levels  the company expects that while the cabinet remodeling market will show modest improvement it will continue to be well below the historic highs reached in the previous decade 
driven by an improving housing market  the company expects that industry wide cabinet remodeling sales will continue a trend that began during fiscal and improve at roughly a mid single digit rate during its fiscal the company expects that its home center market share will be relatively stable in fiscal and it will continue to gain market share in its growing dealer business 
this combination is expected to result in remodeling sales growth that outpaces the market by several percentage points 
the company agrees with the consensus estimate that new construction starts will continue to grow at a mid rate during its fiscal the company s new construction sales growth outperformed the new construction market by approximately points during fiscal  and expects that it will again outperform the new construction market during fiscal but by a significantly lesser rate  as its comparable prior year sales levels become more challenging 
inclusive of the potential for modest sales mix and pricing improvements  the company expects that it will grow its total sales at a mid teen rate in fiscal the company experienced production inefficiencies during the first half of its fiscal driven by the combination of work transition issues from its closed plants  coupled with production volume increases that were driven by unexpectedly high sales levels 
these issues were resolved during the third quarter of the company s fiscal  enabling the company s gross margin rate to improve in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company expects that its gross margin rate and net income for fiscal will improve compared with its fiscal performance 
the company had gross outlays for capital expenditures and customer display units of million during fiscal  and plans to increase this spending level modestly during fiscal however  the company is undertaking a multi year review of its manufacturing capacity and capital expenditure plans which could cause its capital expenditures to exceed this level 
additional risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this annual report  including under forward looking statements  and elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis  as well as in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended april  filed with the sec  including under item a  risk factors and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled million at april   which represented an increase of million from april  total debt was million at april   virtually unchanged from the prior fiscal year and long term debt  excluding current maturities  to capital was at april   down from at april  the company s main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities 
during fiscal the company renegotiated its revolving credit agreement with its primary lender and is no longer required to hold restricted cash to secure borrowings under that agreement 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the million improvement was primarily attributable to the company s million improvement in net income and reduction in asset impairments related to the restructuring 
this improvement was offset in part by a million net working capital investment in its operating assets and liabilities to fund growth and increased contributions to its pension plans of million 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the million improvement was primarily attributable to the reduction in the company s operating loss exclusive of restructuring charges of million 
this improvement was offset in part by reductions in proceeds from income tax refunds of million  from increasing funding to its pension plans of million  and from funding restructuring costs of million 
investing activities the company s investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures and investments in promotional displays 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal investments in property  plant and equipment for fiscal were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal investments in promotional displays were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increased level of investment during fiscal primarily represents machinery and equipment enhancements to enable production volume to increase and an increase in the number of display units deployed with customers 
during fiscal  the company s reduced net cash used for investing activities was driven by the receipt of million in proceeds from the sales of assets from closed plants and insurance proceeds of million  which more than offset the aggregate million increase in outflows for capital expenditures and promotional displays 
the company generated positive free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for investing activities of million during fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was driven by the net improvements in both cash provided by operating activities and decreased net outflows used for investing activities 
the reduction in fiscal was driven by increased net outflows used for investing activities that more than offset net improvements in cash provided by operating activities 
financing activities the company realized a net inflow of million from financing activities in fiscal  compared with a million inflow in fiscal  and a net outflow of million in fiscal reductions in the amount of restricted cash drove inflows of approximately million in both fiscal and additional proceeds of million were generated during fiscal from the exercise of stock options 
approximately million was used to repay long term debt in each of the years in the three year period ended in fiscal  while fiscal and was further impacted by dividend payments to shareholders of million and million  respectively 
the company elected to suspend its quarterly dividend during fiscal the company ended fiscal with a record level of nearly million in cash and cash equivalents 
the company is authorized to repurchase up to million of its stock under an authorization approved by its board of directors in the company continues to evaluate its cash on hand and prospects for future cash generation  and compare these against its go forward reinvestment plans for future capital expenditures 
although the evaluation of its future capital expenditures is ongoing  the company expects that it will make repurchases of its common stock from time to time during fiscal the company can borrow up to million under the wells fargo credit facility  subject to a maximum borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable  of eligible pre bill reserves and up to million for equipment value each as defined in the agreement 
at april   million of loans and million of letters of credit were outstanding under the wells fargo facility 
an amendment to the revolving credit facility and modifications to related security arrangements completed on march  eliminated the requirement that of the company s outstanding indebtedness and other obligations to wells fargo be secured by cash and securities held in certain of the company s accounts with wells fargo 
the company s outstanding indebtedness and other obligations to wells fargo are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the company can borrow under the revolving credit facility up to the lesser of million or the maximum borrowing base which equals of eligible accounts receivable  of eligible pre bill reserves and up to million for equipment value  each as defined in the agreement less any outstanding loan balance 
any outstanding loan balance bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor at april  plus 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  the company must maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of not greater than to  maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of not less than to measured on a rolling four quarter basis  maintain at least in net income for the fiscal quarter ending april  and at least in net income on a rolling four quarter basis for the fiscal quarter ending july   and comply with other customary affirmative and negative covenants 
the company was in compliance with all covenants specified in the amended credit facility as of april   as follows the company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at april  was to  cash flow to fixed charges for its most recent four quarters was to  and its net income for the fiscal quarter ended april  was million 
the revolving credit facility does not limit the company s ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock as long as the company is in compliance with these covenants 
cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements  service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for fiscal the timing of the company s contractual obligations as of april  is summarized in the table below fiscal years ended april in thousands total amounts and thereafter revolving credit facility economic development loans term loans capital lease obligations interest on long term debt operating lease obligations pension contributions total interest commitments under interest bearing debt consist of interest under the company s primary loan agreement  term loans and capitalized lease agreements 
amounts outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility  million at april   bear a variable interest rate determined by the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
interest under the company s term loans and capitalized lease agreements is fixed at rates between and 
interest commitments under interest bearing debt for the company s revolving credit facility are at libor plus the spread as of april   throughout the remaining term of the facility 
the estimated cost of the company s two defined benefit pension plans is determined annually based upon the discount rate and other assumptions at fiscal year end 
future pension funding contributions beyond fiscal have not been determined at this time 
market risks the company s business has historically been subjected to seasonal influences  with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
the costs of the company s products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations 
the company has generally been able  over time  to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases 
on april   the company had no material exposure to changes in interest rates for its debt agreements 
the company does not currently use commodity or interest rate derivatives or similar financial instruments to manage its commodity price or interest rate risks 
for additional discussion of risks that could affect the company and its business  see forward looking statements above and risk factors in the company s most recent annual report on form k filed with the sec 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april  and  the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to give reasonable assurance that the company s operational results and financial position are accurately and fairly reported 
the significant accounting policies of the company are disclosed in note a to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment 
management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
long lived asset impairment 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
for purposes of assessing if impairment exists  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
to determine whether an impairment has occurred  the company compares estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying values 
the company has not recognized impairments of long lived assets in the last three years other than the impairments related to restructuring activities 
revenue recognition 
the company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery 
the company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third party carriers but not delivered to customers 
the estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past months 
revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the company believes have been delivered to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns  cash discounts and other deductions as required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data  including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay 
allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns 
the company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation liability 
the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit total exposure 
the company establishes a liability at each balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the company s ultimate cost 
in the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates  the financial results for the period could be adversely affected 
the company believes that the methodologies used to estimate all factors related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation are an accurate reflection of the liability as of the date of the balance sheet 
pensions 
the company has two non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering many of the company s employees hired prior to april  effective april   the company froze all future benefit accruals under the company s hourly and salary defined benefit pension plans 
the estimated expense  benefits and pension obligations of these plans are determined using various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are the long term expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations 
in fiscal and  the company determined the discount rate by referencing the aon hewitt aa bond universe yield curve 
in fiscal  the company referred to the hewitt above median yield curve in establishing the discount rate 
this change was caused by the merger of aon and hewitt and the corresponding elimination of the hewitt above median yield curve 
the company believes that using a yield curve approach accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds 
the following is a summary of the potential impact of a hypothetical change in actuarial assumptions for the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and consumer price index in millions impact of increase impact of decrease decrease increase effect on annual pension expense effect on projected pension benefit obligation pension expense for fiscal and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in note h of the consolidated financial statements 
at april   the discount rate was compared with at april  the expected return on plan assets was at both april   and april  the assumed rate of increase in compensation levels was for the fiscal years ended april  and the rate of compensation increase is not applicable for periods beyond april  because the company froze its pension plans as of that date 
the projected performance of the company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets 
over the past two measurement periods  the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have resulted from changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets 
accounting guidelines require the discount rate to be set to market at each annual measurement date 
from the fiscal to fiscal measurement dates  the discount rate decreased from at april  to at april   which caused an actuarial loss of million 
from the fiscal to fiscal measurement dates  the discount rate decreased from to which caused an actuarial loss of million 
the company strives to balance expected long term returns and short term volatility of pension plan assets 
favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average life expectancy of the plans active participants 
the actual rates of return on plan assets realized  net of investment manager fees  were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the fair value of plan assets at april  was million compared with million at april  the company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by million in fiscal and by million in fiscal the million increase in the company s net under funded position during fiscal was primarily driven by the company s million actuarial losses  offset in part by a higher return on plan assets and company contributions 
the company expects its pension expense to decrease from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due primarily to a higher expected return on plan assets 
the company expects to contribute million to its pension plans in fiscal  which represents required funding 
the company made contributions of million to its pension plans in fiscal promotional displays 
the company invests in promotional displays in retail stores to demonstrate product features  product and quality specifications and serve as a training tool for designers 
the investment is carried at cost less applicable amortization 
amortization is provided by the straight line method on an individual display basis over the estimated period of economic benefit  approximately to months 
the company believes that the estimated period of economic benefit provides an accurate reflection of the value of displays as of the date of the balance sheet based on historical experience 
product warranty 
the company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues 
the warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the company s remaining obligation based on anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period 
adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates 
warranty claims are generally made within two months of the original shipment date 
stock based compensation expense 
the calculation of stock based compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment 
these estimates include the fair value of each stock option and restricted stock unit award granted 
stock option awards are estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
the company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
for performance based restricted stock units  the company estimates the number of shares that will be granted upon satisfaction of the performance conditions  based upon actual and expected future operating results 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant management judgment 
as a result  if factors change or the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on stock based compensation 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
based upon the company s analysis at april  and  the company determined in each case that a valuation allowance was not required 
the company considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
based upon this analysis  management determined that it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized through expected future income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences 
the company will continue to update this analysis on a periodic basis and changes in expectations about future income or the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences could cause the company to record a valuation allowance in a future period
