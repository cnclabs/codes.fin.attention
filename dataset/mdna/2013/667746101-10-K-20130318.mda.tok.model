overview we are a leading north american manufacturer of large diameter  high pressure steel pipeline systems for use in water infrastructure applications  primarily related to drinking water systems  and we also manufacture other welded steel pipe products for use in a wide range of applications  including energy  construction  agriculture  and industrial uses 
our pipeline systems are also used for hydroelectric power systems  wastewater systems and other applications 
in addition  we make products for industrial plant piping systems and certain structural applications 
with a history that dates back more than years  we have become a leading manufacturer in the welded steel pipe industry 
these pipeline systems are produced by our water transmission group from six manufacturing facilities located in portland  oregon  denver  colorado  adelanto  california  parkersburg  west virginia  saginaw  texas  and monterrey  mexico 
our water transmission group accounted for approximately of net sales in during the second half of  we permanently closed our facility located in pleasant grove  utah  and have transferred its property and equipment to other manufacturing locations 
until april   we also invested in an unconsolidated subsidiary  northwest pipe asia  located in singapore  that produced steel pipe mills 
our water infrastructure products are sold generally to installation contractors  who include our products in their bids to municipal agencies or privately owned water companies for specific projects 
we believe our sales are substantially driven by spending on new water infrastructure with a recent trend towards spending on water infrastructure replacement  repair and upgrade 
within the total range of pipe products  our products tend to fit the larger diameter  higher pressure applications 
our tubular products group manufactures erw steel pipe in three facilities atchison  kansas  houston  texas  and bossier city  louisiana 
we produce a range of products used in several different markets 
the tubular products group makes pipe focused on the energy industry 
we also produce pipe used in industrial  construction  and agricultural applications 
until june   we also made pipe for traffic signpost systems 
our tubular products group generated approximately of our net sales in our tubular products group s sales volume is typically driven by energy spending  non residential construction spending and general economic conditions 
we currently believe the greatest potential for significant sales growth in our tubular products group is through our energy products  which include line pipe and octg products 

table of contents our current economic environment we are monitoring the current economic environment  and we believe there are growth opportunities based on key factors impacting demand for our products 
the price per barrel of crude oil has steadily increased since and is currently trading around per barrel 
natural gas production remained at historically high levels during according to the united states energy information administration 
of the active oil and natural gas rigs  approximately one quarter of the rigs are drilling for natural gas and the other three quarters are drilling for oil 
although rig counts in the united states are down approximately percent from a year ago  we believe drilling activity and the demand for energy pipe will remain at relatively strong levels 
with regard to our water transmission group  we operate our business with a long term time horizon 
projects are often planned for many years in advance  and are sometimes part of fifty year build out plans 
however  in the near term  we expect strained governmental and water agency budgets will impact the water transmission group 
fluctuating steel costs will be a factor in both our tubular products group and our water transmission group  as the ability to adjust our selling prices as steel costs fluctuate will depend on market conditions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  property and equipment  including depreciation and amortization  inventories  income taxes  and litigation and other contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from construction contracts in our water transmission group is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
for a majority of contracts  revenue is measured by the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total costs of each contract cost to cost method 
for a small number of contracts  revenue is measured using units of delivery as progress is best estimated by the number of units delivered under the contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost of steel is recognized as a project cost when the steel is introduced into the manufacturing process 
estimated total costs of each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis by project management and operations personnel for all active projects 
all cost revisions that result in the gross profit as a percent of sales increasing or decreasing by more than two percent are reviewed by senior management personnel 
we begin recognizing revenue on a project when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  recoverability is reasonably assured  and project costs are incurred 
costs may be incurred before we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
in those cases  if recoverability from that arrangement is probable  the project costs are deferred and revenue recognition is delayed 

table of contents provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period such losses are known 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  foreign currency exchange rate movements  changes in raw materials costs  and final contract settlements may result in revisions to estimates of revenue  costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
revenue from our tubular products group is recognized when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collectability is reasonably assured 
deferred revenue is recorded when the manufacturing process is complete and customers are invoiced prior to physical delivery of the product 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on historical experience and management s judgment 
the extension and revision of credit is established by obtaining credit rating reports or financial information on the customer 
an allowance is recorded based on a variety of factors  including our historical collection experience and our historical product quality claims 
at least monthly  we review past due balances to identify the reasons for non payment 
we will write down or write off a receivable account once the account is deemed uncollectible for reasons such as customer quality claims  a contract dispute  deterioration in the customer s financial position  a bankruptcy filing or other events 
we believe the reported allowances at december  are adequate 
if the customer s financial conditions were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may need to be recorded which would result in additional expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
goodwill goodwill related to our tubular products group  one of our operating segments and reporting units  represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with the segment s acquisitions 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually at december or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the tubular products group below its carrying amount 
fair value of the tubular products group s goodwill is evaluated under a qualitative approach which takes into account industry and market conditions  cost factors  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events and changes 
we periodically perform a quantitative analysis  even when the qualitative analysis indicates that fair value of goodwill is above its carrying amount 
this analysis quantitatively calculates fair value of the tubular products group with consideration of the income and market approaches as applicable 
the income approach is based upon projected future after tax cash flows less capital expenditures discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk associated with the future after tax cash flows 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the long term growth rate  the discount rate  and the annual free cash flow 
the market approach is based upon historical measures using multiples of ebitda 
we utilize a weighted average of the income and market approaches  with a heavier weighting on the income approach because of the relatively limited number of comparable entities for which relevant multiples are available 
we also utilize a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the tubular operating segment 
we determined that the fair value of the tubular products group is greater than its carrying amount at december  if our assumptions about goodwill change as a result of events or circumstances  and management believes the assets may have declined in value  then impairment charges will be recorded  resulting in lower profits 
the operations of the tubular products group are cyclical and its sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year 
in the evaluation of our operating segment  we look at the long term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value  which requires management judgment 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
we depreciate the net book value using either the units of production method or a straight line method depending on the classification of the asset 
depreciation expense calculated under the units of production method may be less than  equal to  or greater than depreciation expense calculated under the straight line method 
we evaluate historical and projected units of production at each plant to reassess the units of production expected on an annual basis 
we assess impairment of property and equipment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
the recoverable value of long lived assets is determined by estimating future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  or changes to our business operations 
if we determine the carrying value of the property and equipment will not be recoverable  we calculate and record an impairment loss 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
determining market value of inventories involves judgments and assumptions made by us  including projecting selling prices and cost of sales 
to project market value  we review recent sales and gross profit history  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry supply and demand  forecasted steel prices  replacement costs  seasonal factors  general economic trends and other information  as applicable 
if future market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  inventory write downs may be required 
at december   the inventory balance of million is reported net of lower of cost or market adjustments totaling million 
raw material inventories of steel are stated at cost either on a specific identification basis or on an average cost basis 
all other raw materials  as well as supplies  are stated on an average cost basis 
finished goods are stated at cost using the first in  first out method of accounting 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various united states federal and state and  to a lesser extent  foreign jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances  and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
we record tax reserves for federal  state  local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit 
the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and is a subjective estimate 
we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting dates 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial information regarding costs and expenses expressed in dollars in thousands and as a percentage of total net sales and net sales of our business segments 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  of net sales of net sales of net sales net sales water transmission tubular products total net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss other income expense  net interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales water transmission tubular products year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased by million to million in from million in one customer accounted for of net sales in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in water transmission sales decreased to million in from million in the minor decrease in net sales was due to an decrease in the average selling price per ton offset by an increase in tons produced 
the decrease in average selling prices per ton in was primarily due to a decrease in average material cost per ton including steel 
lower steel costs generally lead to lower contract values  and therefore lower selling prices per ton as contractors and municipalities are aware of the widely available steel costs and market conditions 
the expectation of contractors and municipalities is that the bid values will decrease when steel costs decrease 
we have occasionally negotiated contracts with customers that allow for selling price escalations or reductions that correspond to changes in steel costs 
however  once a bid is accepted  there is typically no opportunity to increase our selling price if steel costs increase 
tons produced in was positively impacted by production for the lake texoma project during the second half of the year 
bidding activity  backlog and production levels may vary significantly from period to period affecting sales volumes 
tubular products sales increased to million in from million in the sales increase was due to a increase in tons sold from  tons to  tons and a increase in the 
table of contents average selling price per ton 
the increase in tons sold was driven by an increase in sales of energy tons  partially offset by a net volume decline in other product lines 
the increase in the average selling price per ton was due to favorable product mix  partially offset by downward price pressure driven by increased competition from imported pipe 
energy pipe represented of tons sold in compared to for the same period of within total energy pipe sales  the proportion of line pipe and heat treated octg product sales increased as compared with average selling prices per ton for line pipe and heat treated octg products are higher than average selling prices for other product lines 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in the increase in gross profit was driven by the decline in material costs including steel and the increase in tons produced as discussed above  as higher production reduced our fixed costs per ton 
however  this was partially offset by a corresponding decrease in the selling price per ton as discussed above 
gross profit from tubular products decreased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in gross profit was negatively impacted by increases in materials cost per ton including steel  which increased as compared with  and by the negative impact on average selling price per ton driven by competition from imports  partially offset by the increase in tons sold 
the increase in materials cost per ton for tubular products as compared with the decrease in materials cost per ton for water transmission was due to timing of purchases 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by a million lower of cost or market adjustment to inventory recorded in there was no lower of cost or market adjustment in additional information regarding our exposure to volatile steel prices is set forth in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase of million as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by a million increase in wages and benefits  a million increase in stock based compensation expense  and a million increase in professional fees and outside services 
in addition  due to the timing of insurance reimbursements  we had expense of million in related to our restatement as compared to a net credit of million in when we received insurance proceeds related to our previous accounting investigation 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in bonus expense and a decrease of million in tubular product sales commission expense following the termination of an external sales group for energy pipe sales 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net decreased to expense of million in from expense of million in the expense recorded in was primarily driven by transactions which did not recur in these transactions included an allowance of million taken on notes receivable  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of all assets of the traffic systems product line of the tubular products facility in houston  texas 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense was a result of lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates 
income taxes 
our effective tax provision rates were and in and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we performed a research and development tax credit study for fiscal years through we recorded a net tax benefit of million resulting from this study in the third quarter of which reduced our effective rate for below our federal statutory rate of 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased by million to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales was due to a increase in tons produced and a increase in the selling price per ton 
the increase in selling prices per ton in was due to an increase in steel costs over and our mix of contracts produced during the cost of steel per ton for water transmission projects increased from to higher steel costs generally lead to higher contract values 
bidding activity  backlog and production levels may vary significantly from period to period affecting sales volumes 
tubular products sales increased to million in from million in the sales increase was due to a increase in tons sold from  tons to  tons and a increase in the average selling price per ton 
the most significant increase in total sales was the result of increases in sales related to oil and natural gas drilling operations  with energy pipe representing of the total tubular product volume increase in certain import duties imposed by the united states government took effect in the second quarter of  and the volume of energy pipe imported in the united states declined 
the higher production volume needed to support these increased sales was enabled by our investment in our bossier city  louisiana facility in  and upgrades to our houston  texas facility  which increased our energy pipe manufacturing capacity 
the increases in average selling prices principally reflect higher steel costs 
steel costs per ton increased by in compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in the increase in gross profit was driven by the increases in tons produced and the increases in average selling price per ton 
the increase was also driven by a more favorable mix of contracts  partially as a result of the completion of lower margin contracts awarded in  which flowed through the income statement in and which were replaced by higher margin contracts bid in and reflected in the income statement  and by the favorable impact of higher volume on the fixed portion of our cost of goods sold as a percent of sales 
this was partially offset by an increase in steel cost per ton  discussed above in the net sales analysis 
gross profit from tubular products increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in as noted above  demand for our tubular products increased significantly  particularly for our energy products 
energy pipe  which has a higher gross profit as a percent of sales than other tubular products  represented of tons sold in compared to in the significant increase in volume also contributed to the increase in gross profit in  as improved market conditions led to higher production which reduced our fixed costs per ton  although this was partially offset by higher steel costs per ton of in compared to additional information regarding our exposure to volatile steel prices is set forth in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the decrease of million as compared to the prior year was driven by a million net credit driven by insurance proceeds received related to our accounting investigation compared to expense of million in this was partially offset by a million increase in bonus and share based compensation due to improved operating results 

table of contents other income expense  net 
other income expense  net increased to an expense of million in from income of million in the increase in expense in compared to was driven by an allowance of million taken on notes receivable  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of all assets of the traffic systems product line of the tubular products facility in houston  texas recognized in the second quarter of interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense was a result of higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates 
income taxes 
our effective tax provision rate was in and our effective tax benefit rate was in the change in the tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase to the valuation allowance of million  as a result of an expected capital loss from which we do not expect to benefit  and the sale of all assets of the traffic systems product line of the tubular products facility in houston  texas  which included the disposal of goodwill of million that had no corresponding tax basis 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our principal sources of liquidity generally include operating cash flow and our amended credit agreement 
from time to time our long term capital needs may be met through the issuance of long term debt or additional equity 
our principal uses of liquidity generally include capital expenditures  working capital and debt service 
information regarding our cash flows for the twelve months ended december  is presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows contained in this form k  and is further discussed below 
as of december   our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was million as compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents totaled  as of december  and  as of december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in was million 
this was primarily the result of net income  depreciation  and fluctuations in our working capital accounts  including decreases in our accounts receivable of million and increases in accrued liabilities of million  partially offset by increases in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million 
this was primarily the result of net income  depreciation  and fluctuations in our working capital accounts  including a million increase in inventories  offset by a million decrease in refundable income taxes 
this was further offset by million in allowances taken on notes receivable 
net cash used in operating activities in was million 
this was primarily the result of a net loss  depreciation  and fluctuations in our working capital accounts  including a million increase in our accounts receivable and an million increase in refundable income taxes  partially offset by a million net decrease in deferred income taxes 
fluctuations in our working capital accounts result from timing differences between production  shipment and invoicing of our products  as well as changes in levels of production and costs of materials 
we typically have a relatively large investment in working capital  as we are generally obligated to pay for goods and services early in the project while cash is not received until much later in the project 
our revenues in the water transmission segment are recognized on a percentage of completion method  therefore  there is little correlation between revenue and cash receipts and the elapsed time can be significant 
as such  our payment cycle is a significantly shorter interval than our collection cycle  although the effect of this difference in the cycles may vary from period to period 

table of contents net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  primarily related to capital expenditures of million 
these expenditures relate to storm water upgrades at our portland  oregon facility and planned capacity expansion in our tubular products plants 
capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million to million for standard capital replacement and recently announced strategic investment projects 
these projects include the installation of an additional horizontal accumulator  hydrotester  and replacement of existing front end forming and finishing equipment at our atchison plant  as well as expansion at our saginaw plant  which will enable production of pipe up to inches in diameter as well as increase overall capacity 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million  primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of the traffic systems product line at the houston facility for million during the second quarter of and an increase in restricted cash from the cash collateralization of certain letters of credit at december  this was offset by capital expenditures of million 
the most significant capital projects in were an expansion at our atchison  kansas facility that increased its production capacity by more than  improved productivity and enabled the facility to manufacture product with wall thickness up to inches 
in addition  we upgraded our houston  texas mill to facilitate production of and inch tubing with physical properties suitable for heat treating 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  primarily related to capital expenditures of million 
the most significant capital projects in were the new mill installation at our pleasant grove  utah facility and preparation and installation of manufacturing equipment in our bossier city  louisiana facility to manufacture octg products 
net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash used in financing activities in was million  which resulted primarily from net borrowings of million under our amended credit agreement  offset by note payable and long term debt payments of million 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  which resulted primarily from net borrowings of million under our credit agreement  offset by note payable and long term debt payments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million  primarily due to a million net increase in the amount outstanding under our credit agreement  partially offset by a decrease in long term debt balances outstanding of million and payment of debt amendment costs of million 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flows expected to be generated by operations  and amounts available under our amended credit agreement will be adequate to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we also expect to continue to rely on cash generated from operations or funds available from our line of credit to make required principal payments on our long term debt during to the extent necessary  we may also satisfy capital requirements through additional bank borrowings  senior notes  term notes  subordinated debt  and capital and operating leases  if such resources are available on satisfactory terms 
see the discussion below under line of credit and long term debt for a discussion of recent developments regarding compliance with the terms of our amended credit agreement 
we have from time to time evaluated and continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and expansion 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital or necessitate additional bank borrowings or other sources of funding 

table of contents line of credit and long term debt we had the following significant components of debt at december  a million amended credit agreement  under which million was outstanding  million of a series a term note  million of series b term notes  million of series c term notes  and million of series d term notes 
on october   the company entered into the amended credit agreement  which amends  supersedes and restates the credit agreement dated may   and provides for a revolving loan  swing line loan and letters of credit in the aggregate amount of up to million 
in addition  the amended credit agreement reflects reductions in the interest rates charged on outstanding balances and a reduction in the number of financial covenants 
the amended credit agreement bears interest at rates related to libor plus to  or the lending institution s prime rate plus to

we had a total of million in capital lease obligations outstanding at december  the weighted average interest rate on all of our capital leases is 
our capital leases are for certain equipment used in the manufacturing process 
approximately million of our capital leases outstanding as of december  represents an agreement entered into as of september to finance our bossier city  louisiana facility the financing arrangement under which certain equipment used in the manufacturing process at the facility is leased 
as part of the financing arrangement  a million escrow account was provided for the company by a local government entity through a financial institution and funds are released upon qualifying purchase requisitions 
as we purchase equipment for the facility  we enter into a sale leaseback transaction with the governmental entity as part of the financing arrangement 
as of december   million was held in the escrow account  which is included in other assets  as a result of proceeds from the financing arrangement 
the financing arrangement requires us to meet certain loan covenants  measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
these loan covenants follow the covenants required by our amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement  the term notes and the financing arrangement and certain lease agreements place various restrictions on our ability to  among other things  incur certain additional indebtedness  create liens or other encumbrances on assets  and incur additional capital expenditures 
the amended credit agreement  term notes  and the financing arrangement and certain lease agreements require us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants 
the results of our financial covenants as of december  are below 
the consolidated total leverage ratio must not be greater than our ratio as of december  is 
table of contents the consolidated tangible net worth must be greater than million 
our tangible net worth as of december  is million 
the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio must not be less than our ratio as of december  is based on our business plan and forecasts of operations  we believe we will remain in compliance with our covenants in the following table sets forth our scheduled contractual commitments that will affect our future liquidity as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years amended credit agreement the term notes capital leases operating leases interest payments total obligations these amounts represent estimated future interest payments related to our debt obligations  excluding the amended credit agreement 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  approximately million in uncertain tax positions has been excluded from the contractual table above
