we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 
we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 
we regard our intellectual property rights  including patents  service marks  trademarks and domain names  copyrights  trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success 
we also rely heavily upon software codes  informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 
we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees  customers  suppliers  affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which  if discovered  might require legal action to correct 
in addition  third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 
we have generally registered and continue to apply to register  or secure by contract when appropriate  our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used  and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate 
we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation 
while we vigorously protect our trademarks  service marks and domain names  effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which we operate  and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract 
similarly  not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered  even if available 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our businesses have been granted patents and or have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office and or various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions 
we consider applying for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop valuable new or improved proprietary technologies or identify inventions  and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future proprietary technologies and inventions as circumstances may warrant 
the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions  and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain 
accordingly  any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology 
in addition  third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own 
likewise  the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties 
from time to time  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business  including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks  copyrights  patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 
any litigation of this nature  regardless of outcome or merit  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are subject to federal  state and local statutes  rules  regulations policies and procedures  both domestically and internationally  which are subject to change at any time  governing matters such as construction  renovation and operation of our venues  licensing  permitting and zoning  including noise ordinances  human health  safety and sanitation requirements  the service of food and alcoholic beverages  working conditions  labor  minimum wage and hour  citizenship and employment laws  compliance with the ada and the dda  historic landmark rules  compliance with united states fcpa  the united kingdom bribery act and similar regulations in other countries  
table of contents hazardous and non hazardous waste and other environmental protection laws  sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes  privacy laws and protection of personally identifiable information  marketing activities via the telephone and online  and primary ticketing and ticket resale services 
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and or proceedings against us by governmental agencies and or consumers  which if material  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation 
in addition  the promulgation of new laws  rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business  which could decrease demand for services  reduce revenue  increase costs and or subject us to additional liabilities 
for example  some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events  particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 
additionally  new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business  such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods  mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams 
from time to time  federal  state and local authorities and or consumers commence investigations  inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection  advertising  unfair business practice  antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws 
our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation  inquiry or litigation 
we and our ticketsnow business are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey  maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern  and in certain cases place limitations on  our ticketing resale practices 
our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not  to our knowledge  bound by such limitations and as a result  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and ticketsnow and other aspects of our ticketing business 
we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation 
in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters  any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular market thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 
our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation 
unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings  including those described in note commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated financial statements  may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings 
in addition  we are currently  and from time to time in the future may be  subject to various other claims  investigations  legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties  as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor 
if the results of these investigations  proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third party lawsuits  we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines  penalties  injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third party lawsuit or counterclaim  we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 
the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business 
upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements  however  we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us  and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements 
in addition  our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently 
a work stoppage at one or more of our owned and or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

table of contents we are dependent upon our ability to lease  acquire and develop live music venues  and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms  or at all  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our concerts and sponsorship advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events 
for these events  we use venues that we own  but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties  ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements  which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time 
our long term success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues  our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration 
as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control  we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all  and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues 
our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors  many of which are also beyond our control  such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters 
if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations  we may decide to forego these opportunities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all  or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues  which poses a number of risks  including construction of live music venues may result in cost overruns  delays or unanticipated expenses  desirable sites for live music venues may be unavailable or costly  and the attractiveness of our venue locations may deteriorate over time 
additionally  the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined  and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources 
newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations 
we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues 
because of this competition  we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 
our revenue depends in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns  and there can be no assurance that such advertising  promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 
similar to many companies  we spend significant amounts on advertising  promotional  branding and other marketing campaigns for our live music events  the live nation  ticketmaster  www 
ticketmaster 
com  www 
livenation 
com and other brand names and other business activities 
such marketing activities include  among others  promotion of events and ticket sales  premium seat sales  hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related merchandise and apparel and costs related to search engine optimization and paid search engine marketing for our ecommerce sites 
during  we spent approximately of our revenue on marketing  including advertising 
there can be no assurance that these marketing or advertising efforts will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 
poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events  which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 
we promote and or ticket many live music events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and merchandise  among other things 
poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote and or ticket a finite number of events 
due to weather conditions  we may be required to reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue  which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event  as well as concession and merchandise sales 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 
we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events  such as terrorist attacks 
the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events  such as terrorist attacks  intentional or unintentional mass casualty incidents  natural disasters or similar events  may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events  which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability 
the terrorism and security incidents in the past  military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors  including public concerns regarding air travel  military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents  causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 
following past terrorism actions  some artists refused to travel or book tours  which adversely affected our business 
the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks  military actions by the united states or others  contagious disease outbreaks  natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business 

table of contents risks relating to our leverage we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 
as of december   our total indebtedness  excluding unamortized debt discounts and premiums  was approximately billion 
our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was approximately million  with outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 
our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic  regulatory and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  mergers and other purposes  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to fund payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for operations and other purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and having a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the covenants in the instruments governing our debt 
to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions  artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures  we will require a significant amount of cash  which depends on many factors beyond our control 
as of december   approximately million of our total indebtedness excluding interest is due in  million is due in the aggregate for and  million is due in the aggregate for and and million is due thereafter 
in addition  as of december   we had approximately billion in operating lease agreements  of which approximately million is due in and million is due in see the table in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations and commitments firm commitments 
our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions  artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash  which depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is  to an extent  subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs  we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
in addition  the terms of our existing debt  including our senior secured credit facility  and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 
these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations 
we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all 
capital markets have been volatile in the recent past  a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise 
as a result  the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations 
any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 
the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that  in turn  could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 
the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends and make distributions  make certain investments  repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness  
table of contents create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  modify the nature of our business  enter into sale leaseback transactions  transfer and sell material assets  and merge or consolidate 
in addition  our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions  including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents  which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 
these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 
furthermore  they may restrict our ability to expand  to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control  such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply 
a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt 
if there were an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness and the obligations there under accelerated  our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy 
we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 
we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations 
if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us  we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries 
our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose 
in addition  the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries future indebtedness  as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 
any inability to fund the significant up front cash requirements associated with our touring and ticketing businesses could result in the loss of key tours or the inability to secure and retain ticketing clients 
in order to secure a tour  including global tours by major artists  we are often required to advance cash or post a letter of credit to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour 
additionally  to secure new  or retain existing  ticketing clients  we are often required by the client to make cash advances at the beginning and or periodically during the term of the agreement 
if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit  for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted 
similarly  if we did not have enough cash on hand  or access to cash  required to advance to new ticketing clients or to continue to pay advances under existing ticketing agreements  our ticketing business would be negatively impacted 
risks relating to our convertible senior notes we may not have the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of the notes or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion if we make the net share settlement election  or we may otherwise be restricted from making such payments  which may increase note holders credit risk 
in july  we issued million of convertible senior notes due in a private placement in the united states to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
on july   july  and july   or in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes  holders may require us to repurchase their notes at a price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  to the repurchase date 
in addition  at any time on or prior to june   we may irrevocably elect net share settlement of the notes  and thereafter we will be required to make a cash payment of up to  for each  in principal amount of notes converted 
however  it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds available at such time to make the required repurchase or settlement of converted notes 
in addition  some of our existing financing agreements contain  and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness could contain  provisions prohibiting the repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances  or could provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement  restrict our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes or restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available to us for that purpose 
if any agreement governing our indebtedness prohibits or otherwise restricts us from repurchasing the notes or making the cash payment upon conversion when we become obligated to do so  we could seek the consent of the lenders to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion or attempt to refinance the other debt 
if we do not obtain such consent or refinance the debt  we would not be permitted to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion without potentially causing a default under the other debt 
our failure to repurchase tendered notes or to pay any cash payable on a conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 

table of contents the additional shares of common stock payable on any notes converted in connection with specified corporate transactions may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transactions 
if certain specified corporate transactions occur on or prior to july   we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate on notes converted in connection with the specified corporate transaction by a number of additional shares of common stock 
the number of additional shares of common stock will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction 
the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes in connection with a specified corporate transaction may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transaction 
furthermore  holders of notes will not receive the additional consideration payable as a result of the increase in the conversion rate until the effective date of the specified corporate transaction or later  which could be a significant period of time after holders of notes have tendered their notes for conversion 
if the specified corporate transaction occurs after july   or if the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction is less than the common stock price at the date of issuance of the notes or above a specified price  there will be no increase in the conversion rate 
in addition  in certain circumstances upon a change of control arising from our acquisition by a public company  we may elect to adjust the conversion rate and  if we so elect  holders of notes will not be entitled to the increase in the conversion rate determined as described above 
the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in holders of notes receiving less than the value of the common stock for which a note would otherwise be convertible 
prior to july   the notes are convertible for shares of our common stock or cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met 
if the specific conditions for conversion are not met  holders of notes will not be able to convert their notes  and they may not be able to receive the value of the common stock or cash and common stock  as applicable  for which the notes would otherwise be convertible 
upon conversion of the notes  holders of notes may receive less proceeds than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after the exercise of the conversion right 
if we elect to settle conversions other than solely in shares of common stock  including by making a net share settlement election  the conversion value that holders of notes will receive upon conversion of their notes are in part determined  subject to certain exceptions  by the average of the last reported sale prices of our common stock for the trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the notes are tendered for conversion  or  if tendered within the days leading up to the maturity date or a specified redemption date  beginning on the fifth day following the maturity date or the redemption date 
accordingly  if the price of our common stock decreases after holders of notes tender their notes for conversion  the conversion value they will receive may be adversely affected 
the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 
the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment only for certain specified events  including  but not limited to  the issuance of stock dividends on our common stock  the issuance of certain rights or warrants  subdivisions  combinations  distributions of capital stock  indebtedness or assets  cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers 
however  the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events  such as an issuance of common stock for cash or acquisition  that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or the common stock  or for a third party tender offer 
risks relating to our common stock we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 
our stock price has fluctuated between and over the past three years 
the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  some of which may be beyond our control  including our quarterly or annual earnings  or those of other companies in our industry  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to the seasonality of our business and other factors related to our business  our loss of or inability to obtain significant popular artists or ticketing clients  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions or divestitures  the publication by securities analysts of financial estimates or reports about our business  
table of contents changes by securities analysts of earnings estimates or reports  or our inability to meet those estimates or achieve any goals described in those reports  the disclosure of facts about our business that may differ from those assumed by securities analysts in preparing their estimates or reports about us  media reports  whether accurate or inaccurate  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  overall market fluctuations  and general economic conditions 
in particular  the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in the past  some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them 
if a suit were to be filed against us  regardless of the outcome  it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our corporate governance documents  rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable  which could decrease the value of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors 
these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents  a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent 
in addition  the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
delaware law  for instance  also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock and us 
although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that  subject to any written agreement to the contrary  which agreement does not currently exist  clear channel will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers  directors or employees 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any director and or officer of the company who is also a director and or officer of clear channel acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate business opportunity a corporate opportunity for both us and clear channel  we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel  unless such opportunity is offered to a director and or officer of the company in writing solely in such person s capacity as a director and or officer of the company 
clear channel will  to the fullest extent permitted by law  have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself  directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us 
these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a third party 
we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us 
under the plan  if any person or group acquires  or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring  or more of our common stock  and in the case of certain schedule g filers  or more of our common stock  and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates  more than of our common stock  without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances  our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock  or shares of the acquiring company  at a substantial discount to the public market price 
therefore  the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 
in addition  the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control 
these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock  which could affect its market price 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth  development and expansion of our business and or to repay existing indebtedness 
accordingly  we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the declaration  payment and amount of future dividends  if any  will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow from operations  current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans  the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law 
in addition  the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders 
accordingly  holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

table of contents future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 
we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 
as of december   there were million shares of live nation common stock outstanding including million shares of unvested restricted stock awards  million shares of common stock issuable from options currently exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share  million shares issuable from the conversion of our convertible notes and a warrant to purchase million shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy 
these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities 
any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time 
the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock 
the hedging or arbitrage could  in turn  affect the trading prices of our convertible notes 
conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 
the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue blank check preferred stock  the designation  number  voting powers  preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors 
our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock 
accordingly  the board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 
risks relating to the separation if the separation were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax free for united states federal income tax purposes  we may be subject to significant tax liabilities 
in connection with the separation  clear channel received both a private letter ruling from the irs and a legal opinion substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its stockholders qualified as a tax free distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections and a d of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel  the irs could assert that the separation did not qualify for tax free treatment for united states federal income tax purposes 
if the irs were successful in taking this position  clear channel could be subject to a significant united states federal income tax liability 
in general  clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value 
in addition  even if the separation otherwise were to qualify under section of the code  it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section e of the code  if the separation were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a or greater interest in clear channel or us 
for this purpose  any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the separation and ending two years after  are presumed to be part of such a plan  although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 
although such corporate level taxes  if any  resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel  we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against tax related liabilities  if any  caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a tax free transaction under section of the code including as a result of section e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions  events or transactions relating to our stock  assets or business  or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement 
if the failure of the separation to qualify under section of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible  we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for of the tax related liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify 
clear channel reported a billion capital loss as a result of the separation 

table of contents we could be liable for income taxes owed by clear channel 
each member of the clear channel consolidated group  which includes clear channel  us and our subsidiaries through december   and clear channel s other subsidiaries  is jointly and severally liable for the united states federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group 
consequently  we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred  and not discharged  by any other member of the clear channel consolidated group 
disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that we cannot quantify 
in addition  clear channel recognized a capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes in connection with the separation 
if clear channel were unable to deduct such capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of any action we take following the separation or our breach of a relevant representation or covenant made by us in the tax matters agreement  we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel for the lost tax benefits that clear channel would have otherwise realized if it were able to deduct this loss
