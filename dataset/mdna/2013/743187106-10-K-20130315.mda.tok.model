item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview general 
progenics pharmaceuticals develops innovative medicines for oncology 
as discussed in business  above  a significant part of our research and development efforts centers on prostate specific membrane antigen psma  where we are conducting phase clinical trials of two product candidates for prostate cancer our therapeutic candidate  psma adc  and mip  an imaging agent candidate in development by our molecular insight pharmaceuticals subsidiary 
among other assets in our pipeline of targeted radiotherapy and molecular imaging compounds are a group of small molecule therapeutics  mip  and  in preclinical study for metastatic prostate cancer and other psma expressing cancers  and azedra  an ultra orphan radiotherapy candidate in phase study  for pheochromocytoma and potential additional indications 
for the acquisition of the privately held molecular insight  we issued its then stockholders a total of million shares of progenics common stock in an unregistered transaction pursuant to sec regulation d  and agreed to pay potential milestones  in cash or progenics stock at progenics option  of up to million contingent upon achieving specified commercialization events and up to million contingent upon achieving specified sales targets relating to all molecular insight products 
as noted below  molecular insight is not included in the discussion and analysis in this item progenics has developed internally and acquired from research institutions  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies compounds and technologies which we determine to advance with other parties  including our first commercial drug  relistor methylnaltrexone bromide subcutaneous injection for the treatment of opioid induced constipation  which as discussed in business  above  we have licensed to salix pharmaceuticals worldwide other than japan  where we have licensed the subcutaneous formulation of the drug to ono pharmaceutical 
we have also recently out licensed to medimmune our proprietary c 
difficile research program for a million upfront payment received in and the right to receive potential future milestone and royalty payments  and transferred our pro hiv viral entry inhibitor to cytodyn for million cash and the right to receive potential future payments as well 
we have recently suspended investment in our proprietary phosphoinositide kinase pik inhibitor research and are evaluating alternative paths forward for this program 
we continue to consider opportunities for strategic collaborations  out licenses and other arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies involving our proprietary research  development and clinical programs  and may in the future also in license or acquire additional oncology compounds and or programs 
our current principal sources of revenue from operations are upfront  commercialization milestone  royalty and revenue sharing payments from salix relistor operations 
royalty and milestone payments from relistor depend on success in development and commercialization  which is dependent on many factors  such as the actions of salix and ono  decisions by the fda and other regulatory bodies  such as the complete response letter mentioned in business and risk factors  the outcome of clinical and other testing of relistor  and  to the extent requested by our collaboration partners  our own efforts 
in late  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
our sources of revenues for the year have primarily consisted of payments under out licensing and collaboration agreements and royalties 
to date  product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents  which we expect will not significantly increase over current levels in the near future 
a majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities 
during  expenses for oncology  primarily related to psma adc  were million compared to million in and million in expenses for relistor and other programs in were million and million  respectively  compared to million and million in and million and million in we also expect to incur a significant amount of development expenses for our psma adc product candidate as clinical trials progress and additional development expenses for mip assets  while expenses  including reimbursement revenue  related to relistor depend on the amount of research and development work we perform upon request by salix or ono 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from million at year end 
we expect that this amount will be sufficient to fund operations as currently anticipated beyond one year 
we may require additional funding in the future  and if we are unable to conclude favorable collaboration  license  asset sale  capital raising or other financing transactions  we will have to reduce  delay or eliminate spending on some current operations  and or reduce salary and other overhead expenses  to extend our remaining operations 
we expect to incur operating losses during the near term 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and auction rate securities decreased million to million from million at year end 
our discussion and analysis in this item does not include assets  liabilities  revenue  expense  income  loss  commitments  contingencies or other items or matters relating to molecular insight  which we acquired subsequent to the periods covered by this item

changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable for  and resulted from the timing of receipts from salix  wyeth  ono  other partnering transactions  and nih  and payments made to trade vendors in the normal course of business 
other than potential amounts we may receive from partnering transactions  we have no other external sources of capital 
other than revenues from relistor  we expect no significant product revenues for a number of years  as it will take at least that much time  if ever  to bring our product candidates to the commercial marketing stage 
investing activities 
of  in cash and cash equivalents primarily invested in money market funds of which  at december    is guaranteed by the us treasury or federal deposit insurance corporation guarantee program 
our auction rate securities of  include  of securities collateralized by student loan obligations subsidized by the us government  of which was redeemed at par during the first quarter of these investments  while rated investment grade by the standard poor and moody rating agencies and predominantly having scheduled maturities greater than ten years  are heavily concentrated in the us financial sector

in addition  during  and  we received cash of   and  respectively  from sales of common stock in satisfaction of severance obligations in and under the now discontinued employee stock purchase plans in and exercise of stock options 
the amount of cash we receive from these sources fluctuates commensurate with headcount levels and changes in the price of our common stock on the grant date for options exercised  and on the sale date for shares sold under the now terminated employee stock purchase plans 
unless we obtain regulatory approval from the fda for additional product candidates and or enter into agreements with corporate collaborators with respect to our additional technologies  we will be required to fund our operations in the future through sales of common stock or other securities  royalty or other financing agreements and or grants and government contracts 
adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us may seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 

table of contents uses of cash operating activities 
the majority of our cash has been used to advance our research and development programs  including conducting pre clinical studies and clinical trials  pursuing regulatory approvals for product candidates  filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending patent claims 
our expenses for research and development for  and  were   and  respectively 
included in the period is  of cash disbursements incurred in connection with a former senior executive first quarter retirement 
for various reasons  including the early stage of certain of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials  our dependence in certain instances on third parties  many of which are outside of our control  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete all our research and development programs

investing activities 
during  and  we have spent  and  respectively  on capital expenditures 
contractual obligations our funding requirements  both for the next months and beyond  will include required payments under operating leases and fixed and contingent payments under licensing and collaboration agreements  including those to which our molecular insight subsidiary is a party 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for future payments under our agreements  and does not include mip obligations payments due by year end total thereafter in millions operating leases license  collaboration and other agreements fixed payments contingent payments total based on assumed achievement of milestones covered under each agreement  the timing and payment of which is highly uncertain 
we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of each of our programs to determine if continued research and development is commercially and economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development in these programs  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete research and development projects in a timely manner or failure to enter into collaborative agreements could significantly increase capital requirements and adversely affect our liquidity 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships or new relationships with licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the above discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be deviations from that plan that would consume our assets earlier than planned 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees we have no obligations under off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other unconsolidated entity 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not otherwise readily apparent 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome and  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified our critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from all sources based on the provisions of the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab and asc revenue recognition 
in october  the fasb updated asc revenue recognition by specifying how to separate deliverables in multiple deliverable arrangements  and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
under asc  the delivered item s are separate units of accounting  provided i the delivered item s have value to a collaborator on a stand alone basis  and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we adopted this update on january  royalty revenue is recognized based upon net sales of related licensed products 
royalty revenue is recognized in the period the sales occur  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement providing for the royalty 
amounts not expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as long term deferred revenue 
the estimate of the classification of deferred revenue as short term or long term is based upon the periods in which we expect to perform joint committee services and or non reimbursable technical assistance 
share based payment arrangements 
our share based compensation to employees includes non qualified stock options  restricted stock and shares issued under our purchase plans  which are compensatory under asc compensation stock compensation 
we account for share based compensation to non employees  including non qualified stock options and restricted stock  in accordance with asc equity 
the fair value of each non qualified stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model requires input assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock  which is based upon the daily quoted market prices on the nasdaq stock market llc over a period equal to the expected term  ii the period of time over which employees  officers  directors and non employee consultants are expected to hold their options prior to exercise  iii zero expected dividend yield due to never having paid dividends and not expecting to pay dividends in the future  and iv risk free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the options  which are based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
historical volatilities are based upon daily quoted market prices of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market llc over a period equal to the expected term of the related equity instruments 
we rely only on historical volatility since it provides the most reliable indication of future volatility 
future volatility is expected to be consistent with historical  historical volatility is calculated using a simple average calculation  historical data is available for the length of the option expected term and a sufficient number of price observations are used consistently 
since our stock options are not traded on a public market  we do not use implied volatility 

table of contents the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based upon historical data related to exercise and post termination cancellation activity 
the expected term of stock options granted to our chief executive officer ceo and non employee directors and consultants are calculated separately from stock options granted to employees and other officers 
we apply a forfeiture rate to the number of unvested awards in each reporting period in order to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimated forfeiture rates are based upon historical data on vesting behavior of employees 
we adjust the total amount of compensation cost recognized for each award  in the period in which each award vests  to reflect the actual forfeitures related to that award 
changes in our estimated forfeiture rate will result in changes in the rate at which compensation cost for an award is recognized over its vesting period 
changes in the assumptions used to compute the fair value of the option awards are likely to affect the fair value of the non qualified stock option awards and the amount of compensation expense recognized in future periods 
a higher volatility  longer expected term and higher risk free rate increases the resulting compensation expense recognized in future periods as compared to prior periods 
conversely  a lower volatility  shorter expected term and lower risk free rate decreases the resulting compensation expense recognized in future periods as compared to prior periods 
for performance based stock option awards vesting of a defined portion of each award will occur earlier if a defined performance condition is achieved  more than one condition may be achieved in any period 
we estimate the probability of achievement of each performance condition and use those probabilities to determine the requisite service period of each award 
the requisite service period for the award is the shortest of the explicit or implied service periods 
for performance and market based stock option awards to our ceo consisting of options in  vesting occurs on the basis of the achievement of specified performance or market based milestones 
the options have an exercise price equal to the closing price on our common stock on the date of grant 
the awards are valued using a monte carlo simulation model and the expense related to these grants will be recognized over the shortest estimated time for the achievement of the performance or market conditions 
on july   we granted an option to our ceo which vests on the basis of the achievement of specified performance based milestones 
the option has an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the award is valued using the black scholes option pricing model and the expense related to this grant will be recognized during the period in which one of the performance milestones is achieved 
the awards will not vest unless one of the performance milestones is achieved or the market condition is met 
changes in the estimate of probability of achievement of any performance or market condition will be reflected in compensation expense of the period of change and future periods affected by the change 
research and development expenses including clinical trial expenses 
clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical investigators and clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed as incurred  and are based on the total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which the patients enter the trial and the period over which the clinical investigators and clinical research organizations to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
in addition to clinical trial expenses  we estimate the amounts of other research and development expenses  for which invoices have not been received at the end of a period  based upon communication with third parties that have provided services or goods during the period 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
fair value measurements 
our available for sale investment portfolio consists of money market funds and auction rate securities  and is recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with asc investments debt and equity securities 
the change in the fair value of these investments is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
we continue to monitor markets for our investments and consider the impact  if any  of market conditions on the fair market value of our investments 
we expect to recover the amortized cost of all of our investments at maturity 
currently  we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business and we believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of principal 
we do not believe the carrying values of our investments are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss 
valuation of securities is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity and general economic and market conditions 
the valuation of the auction rate securities we hold is based on an internal analysis of timing of expected future successful auctions  collateralization of underlying assets of the security and credit quality of the security 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 which requires that comprehensive income and the related components be presented in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the asu was effective beginning january  we adopted this new standard  presenting comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements  and applied it retrospectively on january  as this guidance relates to presentation only  the adoption of this standard had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 which is the result of joint efforts by the fasb and international accounting standards board to develop a single  converged fair value framework 
the converged guidance specifies how to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements 
the asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this new standard on january  and it had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 which requires presentation of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
the asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary investment objective is to preserve principal 
our money market funds and auction rate securities have interest rates that were variable and totaled  at december  as a result  we do not believe that these investment balances have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   we continue to hold approximately  of assets measured at fair value of auction rate securities  in respect of which we have received all scheduled interest payments 
the principal amount of these remaining auction rate securities will not be accessible until the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures and is paid or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider the impact  if any  of market conditions on the fair market value of our investments 
we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of these securities  although valuation of them is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity  and general economic and market conditions 
we do not believe the carrying values of these auction rate securities are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss

we re evaluated the valuation of these securities as of december  and the temporary impairment amount decreased from at december  to a basis point increase to our internal analysis would result in a increase in the temporary impairment of these securities as of december
