item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional details 
our acquisitions involve a number of financial  accounting  managerial  operational  legal and other risks and challenges  including the following  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations any acquired business  technology  service or product could under perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it  or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable  we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions  acquisitions could cause our results of operations to differ from our own or the investment community s expectations in any given period  or over the long term  pre closing and post closing acquisition related earnings charges could adversely impact our results of operations in any given period  and the impact may be substantially different from period to period  acquisitions could create demands on our management  operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address  or for which we may incur additional costs  we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel  operations  financial and other systems  and in retaining key employees and customers  we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition  we may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities  known contingent liabilities that become realized  known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated  internal control deficiencies  or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company s activities 
the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses  adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations  in connection with acquisitions  we often enter into post closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments  earn out obligations and indemnification obligations  which may have unpredictable financial results  and as a result of our acquisitions  we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet 
if we are not able to realize the value of these assets  we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets  which could materially impact our results of operations 
the contingent consideration from the bios acquisition may negatively impact our available cash and results from operations 
as part of the bios acquisition  we are required to make a contingent consideration payment based on revenue growth related to the acquired assets over a three year earn out period 
the ultimate amount we pay may differ significantly from the liability we recorded at the time of the acquisition 
if we are required to pay more than the amount initially recorded  the difference will be recorded as expense in our statement of income  which could materially impact our results of operations 

table of contents if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property  or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights  we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 
we own numerous patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others  which in aggregate are important to our business 
the intellectual property rights that we obtain  however  may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage  and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
in addition  the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged  invalidated  circumvented or designed around  particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected 
in some circumstances  enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons  or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property 
our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage  adequately protect our intellectual property  detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property  and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations 
we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees  consultants and other parties to protect  in part  our trade secrets and other proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights  will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information  or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights 
several of our products are extensively regulated  which could delay product introduction or halt sales 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
although we have not experienced any substantial regulatory delays to date  we can offer no assurance that delays will not occur in the future  which could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities to ascertain compliance with good manufacturing practices and can subject approved products to additional testing and surveillance programs 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspension of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions and criminal penalties 
while we believe that we are currently in compliance  if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business  reputation and our results of operations 
manufacturing or design defects in  unanticipated use of  safety or quality issues with respect to  or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products that we make or sell including in products or components that we source from third parties can lead to personal injury or property damage 
these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products  and result in product liability claims being brought against us 
recalls and product liability claims can result in significant costs  as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations 
we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets  and our other long lived assets as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap to determine whether they are impaired 
if they are impaired  we would record appropriate impairment charges 
it is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future and  if we do so  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results 
new accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to our company from time to time  or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements  could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations for the affected periods 

table of contents our business is subject to sales tax in numerous states the application of indirect taxes  such as sales tax  is a complex and evolving issue 
a company must collect and remit state sales tax from its customers if the company has nexus in a particular state 
the determination of nexus varies by state and often requires knowledge of each state s sales tax case law 
the application and implementation of existing  new or future laws could change the states in which we collect and remit sales taxes 
historically  if we have not properly identified states in which we have nexus  we could be held responsible for payment of sales taxes for the years in which it is determined we had nexus 
we have determined that we have an obligation for sales taxes in numerous states 
the ultimate amount due will depend upon a number of factors  including the amount of sales that were made to customers who already paid the tax or who are exempt  the number of years of exposure  and any penalties and interest 
we continue to evaluate our exposure in additional states  but at this time the amount of the liability is not estimable 
the resolution of these sales tax obligations is likely to have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are utilizing variable rate financing 
in february  we entered into a three year agreement the credit facility for a  revolving line of credit line of credit and up to  of letters of credit 
under the credit facility  indebtedness bears interest at either libor plus an applicable margin  ranging from to  or the bank s commercial bank floating rate cbfr  which is the greater of the bank s prime rate or one month libor  adjusted down  from to 
a change in interest rate market conditions could increase our interest costs in the future and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may face continuing challenges in complying with certain sections of the sarbanes oxley act 
like many public companies  we face challenges in complying with the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act section 
under current frameworks  compliance in areas such as separation of duties  information system controls  etc 
may prove problematic for a smaller company with limited human resources 
we may also be forced to incur on going expense in order to comply with the law under current control frameworks or if the framework changes 
these expenses may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
