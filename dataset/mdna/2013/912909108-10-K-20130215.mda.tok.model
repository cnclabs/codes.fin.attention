table of contents many nations have adopted or are considering regulation of carbon dioxide co emissions 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions 
this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
in the united states  the environmental protection agency epa has published rules for regulating greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements 
in a previous congressional session  legislation regulating co emissions was passed in the house of representatives and was introduced in the senate 
we do not know what action  if any  may be taken by the current or future sessions of congress 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations and canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions 
such regulations may entail substantial costs for emission allowances  restriction of production  and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems 
some foreign nations such as china and india are not aggressively pursuing regulation of co and integrated steel producers in such countries may achieve a competitive advantage over u

raw materials and energy as an integrated producer  u 
s 
steel s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore pellets and sinter ore  carbon units in the form of coal and coke which is produced from coking coal and steel scrap 
u 
s 
steel s raw materials supply strategy consists of acquiring and expanding captive sources of these primary raw materials and entering into flexible supply contracts for certain raw materials at competitive market prices which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions at the time 
the amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products  the quality of raw materials and  to a lesser extent  differences among steel producing equipment 
in broad terms  u 
s 
steel estimates that it consumes about tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and that it consumes approximately tons of coke  tons of steel scrap percent of which is internally generated and tons of iron ore pellets to produce one ton of raw steel 
at normal operating levels  we also consume approximately mmbtu s of natural gas per ton produced 
while we believe that these estimates are useful for planning purposes  substantial variations occur 
they are presented in order to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption related to steel production 
carbon strategy our carbon strategy in north america is to achieve the lowest cost fuel rate to produce hot metal in our blast furnaces 
we have made investments in new facilities at clairton and gary to become self sufficient in coke and to eliminate the need to purchase merchant market coke 
we have aggressively worked to adjust our coal blends that feed our coke batteries in order to use lower cost coals 
we also have increased the natural gas injection capabilities on our blast furnaces to utilize the abundant supply of competitively priced natural gas 
this strategy has improved our flexibility to use the lowest cost combination of coke  injection coal  and natural gas in our blast furnaces to achieve the lowest cost fuel rate in a dynamic pricing environment

final permitting for the expansion was completed in december the total cost of this project as currently conceived is broadly estimated to be approximately million 
smaller projects are also being considered at minntac and keetac that could increase production in future years 
lower than anticipated operating levels in and contractual obligations to purchase iron ore pellets resulted in excess inventory levels at the end of and a portion of the excess iron ore pellets were sold on the global market throughout depending on our production requirements  inventory levels and other factors we may sell additional pellets in the future

blast furnace injection of coal  natural gas and self generated coke oven gas is also used to reduce coke usage 
the decrease in coke production in resulted from the temporary idling of cokemaking facilities at the clairton plant  granite city works  hamilton works and lake erie works for part of the year as well as the permanent shut down of three coke batteries at the clairton plant

steel does not consider sales backlog to be a meaningful measure since volume commitments in most contracts are based on each customer s specific periodic requirements 
environmental matters u 
s 
steel s businesses in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act caa with respect to air emissions  the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances 
in addition  all states where u 
s 
steel operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters 
these laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws have not yet been promulgated and in certain instances are undergoing revision 
these environmental laws and regulations  particularly the caa  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
ussc is subject to the environmental laws of canada  which are comparable to environmental standards in the united states 
environmental regulation in canada is an area of shared responsibility between the federal government and the provincial governments  which in turn delegate certain matters to municipal governments 
federal environmental statutes include the federal canadian environmental protection act and the fisheries act 
various ontario statutes regulate environmental matters such as releases to air and water remediation of hazardous substances  waste storage  treatment and disposal 
as in the united states  canadian environmental laws federal  provincial and local are undergoing revisions and becoming increasingly stringent 
ussk is subject to the environmental laws of slovakia and the eu 
a related law of the eu commonly known as registration  evaluation  authorization and restriction of chemicals  regulation reach requires the registration of certain substances that are produced in the eu or imported into the eu 
although ussk is currently compliant with reach  this regulation is becoming increasingly stringent 
slovakia is also currently considering a law implementing an eu waste framework directive that would more strictly regulate waste disposal and increase existing fees for waste disposed of in landfills including privately owned landfills 
the intent of the waste directive is to encourage recycling and because slovakia has not adopted implementing legislation  we cannot estimate the full financial impact of this prospective legislation at this time 
the eu s industry emission directive will require implementation of eu determined best available techniques bats to reduce environmental impacts as well as compliance with bat associated emission levels 
it contains 
table of contents operational requirements for air emissions  waste water discharges  solid waste disposal and energy conservation  dictates certain operating practices and imposes stricter emission limits 
producers will be required to be in compliance with the iron and steel bat by march  we are currently evaluating the costs of complying with bat  but our most recent broad estimate of likely capital expenditures is approximately million over the to period 
we are currently investigating the possibility of obtaining eu grants to fund a portion of those capital expenditures 
we also believe there will be increased operating costs  such as increased energy and maintenance costs  but we are currently unable to reliably estimate this amount 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations  which in recent years have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations and similar obligations in europe and canada 
in the future  compliance with co emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances  restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems 
since it is difficult to predict what requirements will ultimately be imposed in the united states  canada and europe  it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on u 
s 
steel  but it could be substantial 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major north american and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  if the final requirements do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions  our competitive position relative to mini mills will be adversely impacted 
our competitive position compared to producers in developing nations  such as china and india  will be harmed unless such nations require commensurate reductions in co emissions 
competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted 
the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
many of our competitors  including north american producers  or their successors  that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such matters 
greenhouse gas emissions regulation the current and potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions remains a significant issue for the steel industry  particularly for integrated steel producers such as u 
s 
steel 
the regulation of greenhouse gases such as co emissions has either become law or is being considered by legislative bodies of many nations  including countries where we have operating facilities 
in the united states  the epa has published rules for regulating greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements as further described below 
in utility air regulatory group v 
epa  no 
consolidating various challenges  and texas v 
epa  no 
 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia issued an opinion essentially upholding the epa s greenhouse gas authority 
the court rejected challenges to the endangerment finding  giving the epa authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the caa on the basis that they pose a risk to human health 
the court also rejected arguments by petitioners to dismiss inclusion of greenhouse emissions under the tailpipe rule  giving the epa the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources and triggering regulation for stationary sources 
the court dismissed challenges to the timing and tailoring rules citing that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the case on its merits since none of the petitioners had legal standing to challenge the timing and tailoring rules 
finally  the court declined to decide challenges to other state implementation plan sip related rules issued by the epa regarding greenhouse gas  stating that it also lacked jurisdiction over these sip related rules 
the rules are being challenged in different tribunals 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations for the eu member states  while in canada  a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions has been published  details of which are discussed below

the epa has classified greenhouse gases such as co as harmful gases 
under this premise  it has implemented a greenhouse gas emission monitoring and reporting requirement for all facilities emitting  metric tons or more per year of carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxide in co equivalent quantities 
in accordance with epa greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements  reports for the year were completed and submitted for all required facilities by the march  deadline 
as with previous year s reporting  fourteen facilities submitted reports including gary works  east chicago tin  midwest plant  clairton plant  edgar thomson plant  irvin plant  fairless plant  fairfield sheet  fairfield tubular  granite city works  great lakes works  lorain  minntac and keetac 
the texas operations is the only significant operation not required to report as its emissions were well below the  ton reporting threshold 
new requirements were adopted in related to monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions for vacuum degassing decarburization  and methane emissions from on site landfills 
facilities for which greenhouse gas emissions from decarburization were determined and reported included gary works  great lakes works  and the edgar thomson plant 
calculation of landfill methane emissions from u 
s 
steel facilities were completed earlier this year 
new provisions for incorporating electronic reporting of on site landfill methane emissions were added in enabling those subject to the rule to report greenhouse gas emissions from on site landfills for as with previous year s reports  the epa intends to make this information publicly available from all facilities 
the european commission ec has created an emissions trading system ets 
under the ets  the ec establishes co emissions limits for every eu member state and approves grants of co emission allowances to individual emitting facilities pursuant to national allocation plans that are proposed by each of the member states 
the allowances can be bought and sold by emitting facilities to cover the quantities of co they emit in their operations 
in july  slovakia granted ussk co emission allowances as part of the national allocation plan for the to trading period nap ii approved by the european commission 
ussk was allocated sufficient allowances for the nap ii period and did not have to purchase additional allowances 
during the years ended december   and  ussk entered into transactions to sell and swap a portion of our emissions allowances and recognized gains of million  million and million  respectively 
in december  slovakia enacted an percent tax on excess emission allowances registered in and u 
s 
steel recorded expense of million for the year ended december  the law was changed to eliminate the tax for for the period after  the ets will employ centralized allocation  rather than national allocation plans  that are expected to be more stringent than the current requirements 
the new ets also includes a cap designed to achieve an overall reduction of greenhouse gases for the ets sectors of percent in compared to emissions and auctioning as the basic principle for allocating emissions allowances  with some transitional free allocation provided on the basis of benchmarks for manufacturing industries under risk of carbon leakage 
manufacturing of sinter  coke oven products  basic iron and steel  ferro alloys and cast iron tubes have all been recognized as exposing companies to a significant risk of carbon leakage  but the new ets is still expected to lead to additional costs for steel companies in europe 
we cannot reliably estimate the future market value of co emission allowances and the cost of complying with the new ets at this time

table of contents air the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions 
the caa requires  among other things  the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of maximum achievable control technology mact standards 
the epa has developed various industry specific mact standards pursuant to this requirement 
the caa requires epa to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of hazardous air pollutants 
epa must also conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to mact standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks 
the principal impact of the mact standards on u 
s 
steel operations includes those that are specific to cokemaking  ironmaking  steelmaking and iron ore processing 
in addition  in december  the epa reissued boiler mact regulations  which impose standards and limitations for fuels  including coke oven gas  used in boilers and process heaters and their resulting emissions at u 
s 
steel facilities 
because the rule was signed in late december  has not yet been published in the federal register and is currently being evaluated  the impact of the anticipated boiler mact rule upon u 
s 
steel cannot be estimated at this time 
according to the rule  compliance with the boiler mact standards  with regards to fuel specifications or emission limits  is required within three years of the final published rule  which is expected by early in september  the epa sent u 
s 
steel s integrated steel facilities information collection requests for information regarding emissions from various iron and steel operations to be used in a new iron and steel mact rule 
the current or existing iron and steel mact rule is subject to a legal challenge by the sierra club 
in june  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit granted the epa s motion for voluntary remand of the iron and steel mact 
as a result  while the existing standards are still in effect  the epa anticipates promulgating new iron and steel mact rules in response to the challenge by the sierra club 
because the epa is currently reviewing industry information and data that it received pursuant to its information collection requests that would be used in determining the new standards  the anticipated impact of the new iron and steel mact rules upon u 
s 
steel cannot be estimated at this time 
u 
s 
steel s cokemaking facilities are subject to two categories of mact standards 
the first category applies to emissions from the pushing and quenching processes 
the epa was required to make a risk based determination for pushing and quenching emissions  but is currently working on an information request to determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary 
the epa expects to issue information collection requests in since the epa has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards for cokemaking facilities  the impact if any  on u 
s 
steel cannot be estimated at this time 
the second category of mact standards pertaining to cokemaking facilities applies to emissions from charging  coke oven battery tops and coke oven doors 
with regard to these standards  u 
s 
steel chose to install more stringent controls than mact standards require on some of its batteries  called lowest achievable emissions reductions laer 
such laer batteries are not required to comply with certain residual risk standards until because the scope of these anticipated changes are distant and relatively uncertain  the magnitude of the impact of these anticipated changes on u 
s 
steel cannot be estimated at this time 
the caa also requires the epa to develop and implement national ambient air quality standards naaqs for criteria pollutants  which include  among others  particulate matter consisting of pm 
and pm  lead carbon monoxide  nitrogen dioxide  sulfur dioxide  and ozone 
in  the epa established hour and annual standards for fine particles that are less than micrometers in size and in  the epa tightened the hour standard but retained the annual standard 
in response to a legal challenge to the epa s pm rule making in which the us court of appeals for the district of columbia remanded the primary annual standard to the epa  on december   the epa lowered the annual standard for pm from ug m to ug m  and retained the pm hour and pm 
naaqs rules 
u 
s 
steel could face increased capital  operating and compliance costs related to reductions of pm from affected sources 
at this time  the anticipated impacts on u 
s 
steel cannot be estimated  because the epa must first determine area designations by december  which would become effective in early sips would be due to the epa in  and compliance with the standard would generally be required by  with possible extensions to states were required to demonstrate compliance with the fine particle standard by april  unless the epa granted the state or local jurisdiction an extension  which could be granted through april many states 
table of contents and jurisdictions in which u 
s 
steel operates received a five year extension  requiring that the area demonstrate compliance by april in addition  since the annual standard has been lowered  as disclosed in the remand noted above  some states may be required to modify their sips to meet the new standard  which could result in additional capital  operating and compliance costs to u 
s 
steel 
on december   the epa designated areas in which u 
s 
steel operates as nonattainment and unclassified attainment for the fine particle standard 
sips for the hour standard were due december   with attainment demonstrations with the standard expected to be made sometime between and  unless an extension is granted pursuant to the caa 
it is not possible to estimate the magnitude of any costs associated with the sips for the hour standard or the remand of the annual standard since the state and federal agencies are still developing regulations for the programs and implementation for the hour standard 
in response to a legal challenge to the standards  in  the epa voluntarily proposed to lower the ground level ozone air quality standards  which could affect sources of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds  including coke plants  and iron and steel facilities 
however  in  the epa withdrew the proposed rule 
the epa has advised the regulated community that it would move forward with implementation of the standard 
states must submit sips outlining how they will reduce pollution to meet the standards by a date that is no later than three years after the epa s final designations 
since the epa has made such designations in  states sips are due no later than states are required to meet the standards by deadlines that may vary based on the severity of the problem in the area 
it is anticipated the ozone naaqs revisions could result in significant costs to u 
s 
steel  however  it is not possible to estimate the magnitude of these costs at this time since any implementation requirements will not be known until after areas are designated and sips are developed 
in  the epa retained the annual nitrogen dioxide naaqs standard  but created a new hour naaqs and established new data reduction and monitoring requirements 
while the epa has classified all areas as being in attainment or unclassifiable  it is requiring implementation of a network of monitoring stations to assess air quality 
until the network is implemented and further designations are made  the impact on operations at u 
s 
steel facilities cannot be estimated at this time 
also in  the epa revised the primary sulfur dioxide standard by establishing a new hour standard at a level of parts per billion 
in the rulemaking  the epa also revoked the two previously existing primary standards of parts per billion for hour periods  and the annual standard of parts per billion 
while it is expected that compliance with the new standard could result in additional capital expenditures in the coming years  since the epa has not yet made area designations with regards to the new hour naaqs for sulfur dioxide and states have not yet begun preparing implementation plans  the impact on current operations at u

s 
steel cannot predict the duration of the difficult economic conditions and the trajectory of the recovery but both will have a significant impact on u 
s 
steel both regionally and globally 
u 
s 
steel and its end product markets continue to be impacted by challenging economic and political conditions 
the global economic recession that began in resulted in significantly lower demand and decreased profitability across all of our segments and major markets 
according to published sources  apparent steel consumption in the united states and canada have shown slight improvement in each of the last years  but consumption remains below levels experienced in the period from in europe  steel consumption has recovered at a slower pace and little  if any  improvement is forecasted for while some of our end customer markets supplied by our flat rolled and usse segments saw modest recoveries during and  others  such as construction  remain depressed 
our tubular business is heavily dependent upon the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity in the united states 
lower natural gas prices in resulted in less natural gas drilling 
since our flat rolled segment supplies the majority of the substrate used by our tubular segment  any decrease in tubular demand also adversely affects our flat rolled segment 
our operating levels and prices may remain at depressed levels until demand increases 

table of contents the ongoing eu sovereign debt crisis and economic declines in eu markets have affected product demand and prices for usse 
should conditions worsen in these markets  product demand and pricing may further deteriorate 
while usse does not directly or indirectly hold any sovereign debt investments  dissolution and replacement of the euro currency and the potential reintroduction of individual eu currencies could further adversely impact usse and expose usse to increased foreign exchange risk 
ongoing domestic fiscal issues have adversely affected product demand as many customers are deferring major capital investment projects until there is clear direction surrounding these uncertainties 
the ultimate outcome of these matters may also adversely affect our costs 
domestic monetary policy  particularly the quantitative easing and the suppression of interest rates by the federal reserve  can have significant impacts on u 
s 
steel 
continued suppression of interest rates may negatively affect certain calculations for our defined benefit pension and retiree medical obligations  which are discussed in more detail below 
an eventual increase in interest rates may increase our borrowing costs 
changes in monetary policy may also affect our customers and suppliers in ways that may be detrimental to u 
s 
steel 
china and certain other steel markets were affected less by the global recession and have rebounded more quickly in some cases to  and even beyond levels 
as a result  steel production serving these markets has increased  which has caused prices for iron ore  metallurgical coal and other raw materials to increase 
this development has caused  and may continue to cause  our costs to increase regardless of the state of recovery in our end markets 
u 
s 
steel may face increased risks of customer and supplier defaults 
as the economy continues to recover  our customers and suppliers have been forced to increase their working capital 
we believe some of our customers and suppliers may not have sufficient credit available to them  which could reduce orders and delay payments from customers  resulting in increased customer defaults and cause our suppliers to delay filling  or to be unable to fill  our needs 
u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity investees are also being affected by ongoing challenging economic conditions 
u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity affiliates are also engaged in the production of steelmaking  procurement of raw materials and finishing of flat rolled and tubular products 
as such  they face many of the same issues we do 
since these entities are smaller than u 
s 
steel  they may have fewer resources available to them to respond to ongoing challenging economic conditions 
since the other participants in these joint ventures face many of the same issues  their ability to make capital contributions or do business with these ventures may also be reduced 
risk factors concerning the steel industry worldwide overcapacity and excess supply in the steel industry may negatively affect the profitability of steel producers  including u 
s 
steel 
the steel industry has historically been characterized by excess global capacity and supply  which has led to substantial price decreases during periods of economic recession 
there has also been a pattern of worldwide capacity increases  which have been in excess of the growth in demand of steel products during periods when steel markets are stronger 
continued excess capacity  especially in developing  non market economies such as china  will potentially result in an over supply of steel causing downward pricing pressures  which may further reduce our domestic market share  profitability and financial results 
imports of tubular products to the united states have continued to increase over the past several years 
as foreign and other domestic producers increase their capacity and the availability of tubular products through importation and the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the united states  supply of certain energy related tubular products to the domestic markets we serve will increase and may adversely affect our market share  profit margins  operating results and financial position 

table of contents the steel industry is highly cyclical  which can potentially have an adverse effect on our operations 
steel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets 
as the overall north american economy continues to recover  we have experienced shorter business cycles with durations measured in months rather than the traditional multi year cycles 
this volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with our steel production and customer product demand and can negatively impact our operations 
we face increased competition from alternative materials  which could impact the price of steel and adversely affect our profitability and cash flow 
as a result of increasingly stringent regulatory requirements  designers  engineers and industrial manufacturers  especially those in the automotive industry  are increasing their use of lighter weight and alternative materials  such as aluminum  composites  plastics and carbon fiber in their products 
increased government incentives and requirements for the use of such materials to meet regulatory requirements could reduce the demand for steel products  which could potentially reduce our profitability and cash flows 
rapidly growing supply in china and other developing economies may grow faster than real demand in those economies  which may result in additional excess worldwide capacity and falling steel prices 
over the last several years  steel consumption in china and other developing economies has increased at a rapid pace 
steel companies have responded by rapidly increasing steel production capability in those countries and published reports state that further capacity increases are likely 
steel production capability  especially in china  now appears to be well in excess of china s home market demand 
because china is now the largest worldwide steel producer by a significant margin  any excess chinese supply could have a major impact on world steel trade and prices if this excess and subsidized production is exported to other markets 
since the chinese steel industry is largely government owned  it has not been as adversely impacted by the ongoing difficult economic conditions  and it can make production and sales decisions for non market reasons 
increased imports of steel products into north america and europe could negatively affect steel prices and demand levels and reduce our profitability 
steel sheet imports to the united states accounted for an estimated percent in and percent of the us steel sheet market in and imports of energy related tubular products to the united states remain at high levels and accounted for an estimated percent in  percent in and percent in foreign competitors may have lower labor costs  and some are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments  which allows their production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions 
imports of flat rolled steel to canada accounted for an estimated percent of the canadian market for flat rolled steel products in  percent in and percent in total imports of flat rolled carbon steel products to the eu the countries currently comprising the eu were percent of the eu market in  percent in and percent in increases in future levels of imported steel to north america and europe could reduce future market prices and demand levels for steel products produced in those markets 
we have been and continue to be adversely affected by violations of international trade laws 
imports into the united states  canada and the eu have often violated the international trade laws of these jurisdictions 
while in some cases  u 
s 
steel and others have been successful in obtaining relief under these laws  in other circumstances  relief has been denied 
when received  such relief is generally subject to automatic or discretionary review  rescission or reduction 
there can be no assurance that any such relief will be obtained or continued in the future or that such relief as obtained will be adequate 
since the doc is a cabinet level 
table of contents department and the itc is headed by commissioners nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate  there may be political factors that reduce the level of protection against violation of international trade laws 
there is also a risk that international bodies such as the world trade organization or judicial bodies in the united states  canada or the eu may change their interpretations of these laws in ways unfavorable to u 
s 
steel 
limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 
u 
s 
steel and other steel producers have periodically been faced with problems in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner due to delays  defaults or force majeure events by suppliers  shortages or transportation problems such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or disruption of rail lines  waterways or natural gas transmission lines  resulting in production curtailments 
as a result  we may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials from third parties 
as other areas of the world have recovered faster than north america and europe  raw materials demand and prices have increased 
usse purchases substantially all of its iron ore and coking coal requirements from outside sources 
usse is also dependent upon availability of natural gas produced in russia and transported through ukraine 
any curtailments and escalated costs may further reduce profit margins 
if our newly constructed coke battery or our carbon alloy facility  currently under various stages of start up and construction  do not produce the anticipated quality or volume of products  we may become dependent upon purchased coke as some of our existing batteries are approaching the end of their useful lives 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 
steel producers in the united states  along with their customers and suppliers  are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
steel producers in the eu are also subject to similar laws 
these laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
environmental laws and regulations  particularly the caa  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
international environmental requirements vary 
while standards in the eu  canada and japan are generally comparable to us standards  other nations  particularly china  have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors in such nations a competitive advantage 
greenhouse gas policies could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
in the united states  the epa has published rules for regulating greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements 
in a previous congressional session  legislation regulating co emissions was passed in the house of representatives and introduced in the senate 
we do not know what action  if any  may be taken by the current or future sessions of congress 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations and canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions 
for a discussion of these  see part i business environmental matters 
we cannot predict the final requirements that may be adopted in the united states and canada  or the form of future actions that may be taken by the eu  however  such actions could entail substantial costs for emission allowances  restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems 
this could have a negative effect on results of our operations and cash flows 
since mini mill production does not involve the same chemical reactions as integrated production  mini mills may have a competitive advantage 
additionally  since china and many other developing nations have not instituted greenhouse gas regulations  and since past international agreements such as the kyoto protocol provided exemptions and lesser standards for developing nations  we may be at a competitive disadvantage with certain foreign steel producers 
many of our customers in the united states  canada and europe may experience similar impacts  which could result in decreased demand and lower prices for our products 

table of contents risk factors concerning u 
s 
steel legacy obligations our retiree health care and retiree life insurance plan costs  most of which are unfunded obligations  and our pension plan costs in north america are higher than those of many of our competitors 
these plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
we maintain retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit pension plans covering many of our north american employees and former employees upon their retirement 
as of december   approximately  current employees  retirees and beneficiaries are participating in the plans to receive pension and or healthcare and life insurance benefits 
at december   on an accounting basis  u 
s 
steel s retiree medical and life insurance plans were underfunded by billion and our pension plans were underfunded by billion 
most of our employee benefits are subject to collective bargaining agreements and will be subject to future negotiations 
about two thirds of our costs for the domestic usw participants retiree health benefits in the company s main domestic other benefit plan are limited to a per capita dollar maximum calculation based on base year actual costs incurred under the main u 
s 
steel benefit plan for usw participants the cost cap 
the full effect of the cost cap was deferred in the labor agreements until if the cost cap was not in place  our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our other benefit plans could increase by billion 
minimum contributions to domestic qualified pension plans other than contributions to the steelworkers pension trust spt described below are regulated under erisa and the pension protection act of the ppa 
minimum contributions to ussc pension plans are governed by an agreement entered into by stelco inc stelco and the province of ontario that u 
s 
steel assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of stelco the agreement 
the agreement requires ussc to fund annually a c million flat dollar contribution plus special contributions for cost of living adjustments cola indexing and other amendments adopted since for the four main ussc pension plans through after this time  the minimum contribution requirements for ussc s plans are subject to provincial rules for funding defined benefit plans which generally require the funding of solvency deficiencies over a five year period 
this may require significantly more annual contributions than is currently required under the agreement 
assets held by the trusts under our pension plans and our trust for retiree health care and life insurance benefits are subject to the risks  uncertainties and variability of the financial markets 
additionally  certain corporate bond rates are utilized in determining the discount rate used to measure our pension and other benefit obligations for both us gaap and funding purposes 
the federal reserve board has continued to suppress interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the broader american economy  which has had the direct effect of lowering the bond rates used in the determination of the appropriate discount rate 
a lower discount rate reduces the funded position of these plans 
the pension stabilization legislation  enacted during  includes a revised interest rate formula used to measure defined benefit pension obligations for calculating minimum annual contributions 
the new interest rate formula for funding purposes is expected to result in higher interest rates compared to prior law over the next few years which will improve the funded status of our main defined benefit pension plan and reduce minimum required contributions  but does not impact the company s accumulated benefit obligation for us gaap measurement and financial statement recognition purposes 
this reduces  but does not eliminate  the risk of mandatory contributions 
the level of cash funding for our defined benefit pension plans in future years depends upon various factors including voluntary contributions that we may make  future pension plan asset performance  actual interest rates under the law  and the impacts of business acquisitions or divestitures  union negotiated benefit changes and future government regulations  many of which are not within our control 
if there is significant underfunding of the obligations under our defined benefit pension plans  u 
s 
steel may be required  or may choose to make substantial contributions to these plans  which may divert committed capital to satisfy funding requirements related to these obligations and delay or cancel capital projects that we believe would increase our ability to meet our customers needs as well as improve our profitability 
u 
s 
steel contributes domestically to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan  the spt  for usw represented employees formerly employed by national steel and represented employees hired after may 
table of contents we have legal requirements for future funding of this plan should the spt become significantly underfunded or we decide to withdraw from the plan 
either of these scenarios may negatively impact our future cash flows 
the labor agreements with the usw continue to require the same contribution rate from the previous labor agreements of per hour for most steelworker employees 
collectively bargained company contributions to the plan could increase as a result of future changes agreed to by the company and the usw 
despite the global recession  domestic health care costs continue to increase each year  and could accelerate due to inflationary pressures on the overall health care trend rates  government mandates such as the patient protection and affordable care act of  and advances in medicine and pharmacology 
these may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
benefit obligations under our plans are not tied to operating rates or financial results  therefore  our costs do not change to reflect general economic conditions 
many domestic and international competitors do not provide retiree health care and life insurance or defined benefit pension plans to their employees 
many other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored retirement and health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage 
we have higher environmental remediation costs than our competitors 
this may create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
u 
s 
steel is involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities  facilities that have been closed or sold to unrelated parties and other sites where material generated by u 
s 
steel was deposited 
in addition  there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation 
for example  we recorded a charge of million in related to a component of the gary works rcra corrective action program 
environmental remediation costs and related cash requirements of many of our competitors may be substantially less than ours 
many international competitors do not face similar laws in the jurisdictions where they operate 
many us competitors have substantially shorter operating histories than we do  resulting in less exposure for environmental remediation 
competitors that have obtained relief under bankruptcy laws have been released from certain environmental obligations that existed prior to their bankruptcy filings 
other risk factors applicable to u 
s 
steel unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may reduce our results of operations 
our steel production depends on the operation of critical structures and pieces of equipment  such as blast furnaces  casters  hot strip mills and various structures and operations that support them 
it is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production and increased maintenance and repair costs due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers 
for example  we experienced a structural failure at gary works in that disrupted operations for several weeks 
it is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages  explosions  fires  floods  accidents and severe weather conditions 
we are also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future 
availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions  such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or unavailability of rail lines or of locks on the great lakes or other bodies of water 
to the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage  our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by volatility in prices for raw materials  energy  and steel 
in  approximately percent of u 
s 
steel s flat rolled segment sales in the united states are based on sales contracts with volume commitments and durations of at least one quarter  while lesser percentages of tubular and usse segment sales are made pursuant to such contracts 
these contracts generally have a fixed price or a price that will fluctuate with changes in a defined index and do not always have firm volume commitments 
during periods of rapid escalation of raw materials  energy and other costs  u 
s 
steel may not be 
table of contents able to recover these cost increases from customers with existing fixed price agreements 
conversely  some purchase contracts require annual commitments  or we may elect to make multi year commitments  and in periods of rapid decline  u 
s 
steel may be faced with having agreed to purchase raw materials and energy at prices that are above the then current market price or in greater volumes than required 
if steel prices decline  our profit margins on market based indexed contracts and spot business will be reduced 
declines in the production levels of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we sell to the automotive  service center  converter  energy and appliance and construction related industries  all of which have been significantly impacted by the ongoing challenging economic conditions 
low demand from customers in these key markets may adversely affect our results of operations 
we face risks concerning new technologies  products and increasing customer requirements 
technologies such as direct iron reduction and carbon substitution may be more cost effective than our current production methods 
however  we may not have sufficient capital to invest in such technologies and may  from time to time  incur cost over runs and difficulties adapting and fully integrating these technologies into our existing operations 
we may also encounter control or production restrictions  or not realize the cost benefit from such capital intensive technology adaptations to our current production processes 
customers such as the automotive industry are demanding stronger and lighter products 
tubular customers are increasingly requesting pipe producers to supply connections and other ancillary parts as well as inspection and other services 
we may not be successful in meeting these technological challenges and there may be increased liability exposures connected with the supply of additional products and services 
product liability claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
events such as well failures  line pipe leaks  blowouts  bursts  fires and product recalls could result in claims that our products or services were defective and caused death  personal injury  property damage or environmental pollution 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate  available to protect us in the event of a claim  or its coverage may be limited  canceled or otherwise terminated  or the amount of our insurance may be less than the related impact on our enterprise value after a loss 
the terms of our indebtedness contain provisions that may limit our flexibility 
the amended credit agreement is secured by a lien on a majority of our domestic inventory and certain of our accounts receivable and includes a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that applies to the most recent four consecutive quarters when availability under the amended credit agreement is less than the greater of of the total aggregate commitments and million 
the value or levels of inventory may decrease or we may not be able to meet this covenant in the future  and either or both of these situations would limit our ability to borrow under the amended credit agreement 
in addition  beginning on february  and extending until the repayment or conversion of the senior convertible notes  we must maintain minimum liquidity as further defined in the amended credit agreement of at least million  if the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the senior convertible notes is million or greater  or minimum liquidity of million  if the outstanding principal amount is lower than million 
the minimum liquidity must include at least million of availability under the amended credit agreement 
this may be a particular problem as market conditions and order levels continue to improve when u 
s 
steel may need the liquidity to build working capital 
we have granted the lenders under the amended credit agreement a secured position in our most liquid assets  which may be a detriment to other creditors 
we also have a receivables purchase agreement rpa that provides liquidity depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables 
reductions in accounts receivable would reduce the amount of receivables available for sale 

table of contents the amended credit agreement  our senior convertible notes issued in and our billion of senior notes also contain covenants limiting our ability to create liens and engage in sale leasebacks 
additionally  the repayment of amounts outstanding under the amended credit agreement and repurchase of the senior convertible notes and senior notes is required upon a change of control under specified circumstances  as well as other customary provisions 
the amended credit agreement  the senior convertible notes and the rpa have provisions that certain defaults under a material debt obligation could cause a default under the amended credit agreement or the senior convertible notes or termination of the rpa 
these terms may affect our liquidity  our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
at december   in the event of a change in control of u 
s 
steel  holders of u 
s 
steel debt obligations totaling approximately billion  which includes the senior notes and the senior convertible notes  may require u 
s 
steel to repurchase such obligations in whole or in part for cash at a price equal to percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in such an event  u 
s 
steel may also be required to either repurchase the leased fairfield caster for million  or provide a letter of credit to secure the remaining obligation 
we face substantial debt maturities 
over the next six years  we have billion of debt maturing see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we may not be able to refinance this debt or may be forced to do so on terms substantially less favorable to u 
s 
steel than our currently outstanding debt 
we may be forced to delay or not make capital expenditures  which may adversely affect our competitive position and financial results 
rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financial costs 
any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult  may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings  may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
change in control clauses in our financial and labor agreements grant the other parties to those agreements rights to accelerate obligations and to terminate or extend our labor agreements 
upon the occurrence of change in control events specified in our senior notes  amended credit agreement  senior convertible notes and various other contracts and leases  the holders of our indebtedness may require us to immediately repurchase or repay that debt on less than favorable terms 
additionally  the labor agreements give the usw the right to either terminate the collective bargaining agreement or extend it for an additional three years 
among other things  these provisions may make a takeover of u 
s 
steel more difficult 
a change of control is generally defined to include any of the following a the acquisition by a person or group of at least percent of our common stock  b a merger in which holders of our common stock own less than a majority of the equity in the resulting entity  or c replacement of a majority of the members of our board of directors by persons who were not nominated by our current directors 
our operations expose us to uncertainties and risks in the countries in which we operate  which could negatively affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our us operations are subject to economic conditions  including credit and capital market conditions  and political factors in the united states  which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  inflation  increased regulation  limitations on exports of energy and raw materials  and trade remedies 
actions taken by the us government could affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
ussk  located in slovakia and ussc  located in canada  constitute percent of our global raw steel production capability 
both of them are subject to economic conditions  including credit and capital market conditions  and political factors in the countries in which they are located  and ussk is subject to economic conditions and political 
table of contents factors associated with the eu and the euro currency 
changes in any of these economic conditions or political factors could negatively affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  government instability  civil unrest  increased regulation and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
an example of such a change is the increase of the slovak corporate tax rate from to effective january  any future foreign acquisitions or expansions could expose us to similar risks 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and may incur in the future  facility carrying costs when production capacity is idled  increased costs to resume production at idled facilities  or costs to idle facilities 
our decisions concerning what facilities to operate and at what levels are made based upon our customers orders for products as well as the capabilities and cost performance of our locations 
in depressed markets such as those experienced in the recent recession  we concentrated production operations at several plant locations and did not operate others in response to customer demand 
when we restart idled facilities  we incur costs to replenish raw material inventories  prepare the previously idled facilities for operation  perform the required repair and maintenance activities and prepare employees to return to work safely and resume production responsibilities 
faced with temporary or structural overcapacity in various markets  we may in the future seek to rationalize operations through asset sales  temporary shutdowns or closures of facilities 
these initiatives may lead to significant costs or charges 
we are subject to significant foreign currency risks  which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows 
our foreign operations accounted for approximately percent of our net sales in the financial condition and results of operations of ussk and ussc are reported in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements 
the appreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  international cash requirements have been and in the future may be funded by intercompany loans  creating intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities involved  which can have a non cash impact on income when they are remeasured at the end of each period 
if the eu abandons the euro  or if one or more members withdraw  the re introduction of individual currencies would expose us to foreign exchange rate risks for each currency 
any future foreign acquisitions or expansions may increase such risks 
our business requires substantial expenditures for debt service obligations  capital investments  operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund 
with billion of long term debt outstanding as of december   we have significant debt service requirements 
our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended december   total capital expenditures were billion 
at december   our contractual commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment totaled million and we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating leases 
in addition to capital expenditures and lease payments  we spend significant amounts for maintenance of our raw material  iron and steelmaking and steel finishing facilities 

table of contents as of december   we had contingent obligations consisting of indemnity obligations under active surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit totaling approximately million and contractual purchase commitments  including take or pay arrangements  totaling approximately billion 
our business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow or external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient  to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund capital expenditures and other liquidity needs 
the limitations under our amended credit agreement and rpa  described above  may limit our availability to draw upon these facilities 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings outside the united states  however  if we repatriate funds in the future in excess of our intercompany loan balances  which at the end of total approximately billion  the tax consequences would reduce income and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is exposed to uninsured losses 
our insurance coverage against catastrophic casualty and business interruption exposures contains certain common exclusions  substantial deductibles and self insured retentions 
our collective bargaining agreements may limit our flexibility 
most hourly employees of u

steel s flat rolled  tubular  cokemaking and iron ore pellet facilities in the united states are covered by the labor agreements  which expire on september  these agreements contain provisions that prohibit us from pursuing any north american transaction involving steel or steel related assets without the consent of the usw  grant the usw a right to bid on any sale of one or more facilities covered by the labor agreements  require us to make reasonable and necessary capital expenditures to maintain the competitive status of our domestic facilities and require mandatory pre funding of a trust for retiree health care and life insurance 
these agreements also restrict our ability to trade  sell or use foreign produced coke and iron ore in north america  and further require that the ratio of non usw employees to usw employees at our domestic facilities not exceed one to five 
while other domestic integrated unionized steel producers have similar requirements in their agreements with the usw  non union producers are not subject to such requirements 
in europe  most represented employees at ussk are represented by the oz metalurg union and are covered by an agreement that expires at the end of december at ussc  the collective bargaining agreement with the usw covering employees at the lake erie works and hamilton works expires in april and october  respectively 
many international competitors operate in jurisdictions where employees have significantly fewer rights  which may give an advantage to such competitors

table of contents we are exposed to potential impairment of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
as of december   we have billion of goodwill  which exposes us to the risk of future impairment charges 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment allows for either a review of certain economic  cost  market and other qualitative factors  or a quantitative analysis comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value is determined based on consideration of the income  market and cost approaches as applicable in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic as of december   the flat rolled and texas operations  which is part of the tubular segment  reporting units have million and million of goodwill  respectively 
u 
s 
steel completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined on the basis of a number of economic  cost  market and other qualitative factors  including consideration of certain factors from the annual goodwill impairment evaluation  there was no indication of goodwill impairment for any of the reporting units 
the annual goodwill impairment test showed the estimated fair values of our flat rolled and texas operations  which is a part of our tubular segment  reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately billion and million  respectively 
a basis point increase in the discount rate  a critical assumption in which even a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  would decrease the fair value of the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units by approximately billion and million  respectively 
if business conditions deteriorate or other factors have an adverse effect on our qualitative and quantitative estimates  inclusive of discounted future cash flows or assumed growth rates  or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization  future evaluations of goodwill impairment may result in impairment charges 
there are risks associated with future acquisitions the success of any future acquisitions will depend substantially on the accuracy of our analysis concerning such businesses and our ability to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms  as well as to finance such acquisitions and to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations 
if we are unable to integrate new operations successfully  our financial results and business reputation could suffer 
additional risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  the possible assumption of unknown liabilities  potential disputes with the sellers  and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase the company s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations and countries 
antitrust and other laws may prevent us from completing acquisitions 
future acquisitions may result in additional goodwill 
there are risks associated with existing and potential accounting and tax requirements 
we do not recognize a tax benefit for pretax losses in jurisdictions where we have recorded a full valuation allowance for accounting purposes 
as a result  the pretax losses associated with ussc do not provide any tax benefit for accounting purposes 
significant changes in the mix of pretax results among the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
similarly  our use of intercompany loans has and in the future may have significant impacts on our financial statements as a result of foreign currency accounting remeasurement effects 
potential future accounting changes could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
even if the impacts are non cash  they may materially impact perceptions and judgments about us by rating agencies and investors 
changes in tax law could also negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
we may be subject to litigation  the resolution of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a particular period 
our profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future

with respect to our represented employees  we may be adversely impacted by the loss of employees who retired or obtained other employment during the time they were laid off or subject to a work stoppage 
a failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business and operations 
we rely upon the capacity  reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business 
for example  we continue to deploy an erp system at our various locations to help us operate more efficiently 
this is a complex project  which is expected to be implemented in several phases over the next few years 
we may not be able to successfully implement the erp program without experiencing difficulties 
in addition  the expected benefits of implementing the erp system  such as increased productivity and operating efficiencies  may not be fully realized or the costs of implementation may outweigh the realized benefits 
along with modifying the implementation schedule in early to reduce near term costs  we modified the implementation schedule in to extend the time period for system stabilization following deployments  which extends the overall timeline for project completion 
this action will delay the realization of benefits from this project and may add to final project costs 
further  if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important information technology system  the resulting disruptions could have an adverse affect on our business 
increased global information technology security requirements  vulnerabilities  threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems  networks and the confidentiality  availability and integrity of our data 
despite our efforts to protect sensitive information  confidential and personal data  our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches 
this could lead to disclosure  modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information  defective products  production downtimes and operational disruptions  which in turn could adversely affect our reputation  competitiveness and results of operations 
we may face greater risks in this area than our competitors as we implement the erp system because among other things  we must simultaneously protect both the erp and legacy systems until the erp project is complete 
we have several operations conducted by joint ventures and other equity investees that we cannot operate solely for our benefit 
several of our joint ventures and other equity investees are strategically important to u 
s 
steel 
under joint venture and other equity investee arrangements  we share ownership and management of an entity with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals  strategies  priorities or resources as we do 
in general  joint ventures and other equity investees are intended to be operated for the benefit of all of the investors  rather than for our sole benefit 
the benefits from a successful joint venture or other equity arrangement are shared among the investors  so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures 
for additional information with respect to our joint ventures and other equity investees  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we depend on third parties for transportation services  and increases in costs or the availability of transportation could adversely affect our business and operations 
our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products  both domestically and internationally 
we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute as well as delivery of our raw materials 
if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner  we may be unable to manufacture and deliver our products in response to customer demand 
in addition  if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us  we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost 
in addition  such failure of a third party transportation provider could harm our reputation  negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use in our production processes are transported by railroad  trucks  barges and ships  which are highly regulated 
changes in these regulations could increase our costs or reduce the availability of such transportation 
in addition  an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability

as of december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases 
table of contents involving approximately  plaintiffs 
during  settlements and dismissals resulted in the disposition of approximately claims and u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
new filings added approximately claims 
about  or approximately percent  of these claims are currently pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
most of the claims filed in  and involve individual or small groups of claimants 
historically  these claims against u 
s 
steel fall into three major groups claims made by persons who allegedly were exposed to asbestos at u 
s 
steel facilities referred to as premises claims  claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to products formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel  and claims made under certain federal and general maritime laws by employees of former operations of u 
s 
steel 
the ultimate outcome of any claim depends upon a myriad of legal and factual issues  including whether the plaintiff can prove actual disease  if any  actual exposure  if any  to u 
s 
steel products  the duration of exposure to asbestos  if any  on u 
s 
steel s premises and the plaintiff s exposure to other sources of asbestos 
in general  the only insurance available to u 
s 
steel with respect to asbestos claims is excess casualty insurance  which has multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has received minimal payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
these asbestos cases allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
u 
s 
steel is currently a defendant in cases in which a total of approximately plaintiffs allege that they are suffering from mesothelioma 
the potential for damages against defendants may be greater in cases in which the plaintiffs can prove mesothelioma 
in many cases in which claims have been asserted against u 
s 
steel  the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises  however  with the decline in mass plaintiff cases  the incidence of claimants actually alleging a claim against u 
s 
steel is increasing 
in addition  in many asbestos cases  the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all  that any injuries they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos  or that such alleged exposure was in any way related to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises 
in every asbestos case in which u 
s 
steel is named as a party  the complaints are filed against numerous named defendants and generally do not contain allegations regarding specific monetary damages sought 
to the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought  the amount applies to claims against all named defendants and in no case is there any allegation of monetary damages against u 
s 
steel 
historically  approximately percent of the cases against u 
s 
steel did not specify any damage amount or stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed 
jurisdictional amounts generally range from  to  u 
s 
steel does not consider the amount of damages alleged  if any  in a complaint to be relevant in assessing our potential exposure to asbestos liabilities 
u 
s 
steel aggressively pursues grounds for the dismissal of u 
s 
steel from pending cases and litigates cases to verdict where we believe litigation is appropriate 
u 
s 
steel also makes efforts to settle appropriate cases  especially mesothelioma cases  for reasonable  and frequently nominal  amounts 
the following table shows activity with respect to asbestos litigation year ended december  opening number of claims claims dismissed  settled and resolved new claims closing number of claims amounts paid to resolve claims in millions the amount u 
s 
steel has accrued for pending asbestos claims is not material to u 
s 
steel s financial position 
u 
s 
steel does not accrue for unasserted asbestos claims because it is not possible to determine whether any 
table of contents loss is probable with respect to such claims or even to estimate the amount or range of any possible losses 
the vast majority of pending claims against us allege so called premises liability based exposure on u

steel settings vary with each claimant  and the strength or weakness of the causal link between u 
s 
steel exposure and any injury vary widely as do the nature and severity of the injury claimed 
we are unable to estimate the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  although the resolution of such matters could significantly impact results of operations for a particular period 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  most asbestos containing material was removed or remediated at u 
s 
steel facilities many years ago and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals 
the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
environmental proceedings the following is a summary of the proceedings of u 
s 
steel that were pending or contemplated as of december   under federal and state environmental laws 
except as described herein  it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
cercla remediation sites claims under cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  it is impossible to reasonably estimate u 
s 
steel s ultimate cost of compliance with cercla 
projections  provided in the following paragraphs  of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the factors provided in the preceding paragraph 
to the extent these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future spending for  or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from what was stated in forward looking statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel had been identified as a prp at a total of cercla sites where liability is not resolved 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that u 
s 
steel s liability for cercla cleanup and remediation costs will be less than  for sites  between  and million for sites  between million and million for sites and over million for site 
the one site over million is the former duluth works  which was listed by the minnesota pollution control agency mpca under the minnesota environmental response and liability act on its permanent list of priorities 
the epa has included the duluth works site with the st 
louis river interlake duluth tar site on its national priorities list 
the duluth works cleanup has proceeded since u 
s 
steel has prepared a conceptual habitat enhancement plan hep that includes measures to address contaminated 
table of contents sediments in the st 
louis river estuary 
mpca on behalf of the epa has completed its second five year review for the site 
as a result  additional data collection has been undertaken to address data gaps identified in the five year review and corrective measures are being implemented to address the discovered areas of contamination on the upland property 
additional study  investigation and oversight costs along with implementation of corrective measures on the upland property and implementation of the hep are currently estimated at million 
in addition  there are sites related to u 
s 
steel where information requests have been received or there are other indications that u 
s 
steel may be a prp under cercla  but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
other remediation activities there are additional sites where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be under  per site  another sites have potential costs between  and million per site  and sites may involve remediation costs between million and million per site 
as described below  costs for remediation  investigation  restoration or compensation are estimated to be in excess of million per site at sites 
potential costs associated with remediation at the remaining sites are not presently determinable

overview according to the world steel association s latest published statistics  u 
s 
steel was the thirteenth largest steel producer in the world in we believe we are currently the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in north america  one of the largest integrated flat rolled producers in central europe and the largest tubular producer in north america 
u 
s 
steel has a broad and diverse mix of products and customers 
u 
s 
steel uses iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc  tin and other metallic additions to produce a wide range of flat rolled and tubular steel products  concentrating on value added steel products for customers with demanding technical applications in the automotive  appliance  container  industrial machinery  construction and oil  gas and petrochemical industries 
in addition to our facilities in the united states  u 
s 
steel has significant operations in canada through u 
s 
steel canada ussc and in europe through u 
s 
steel ko ice ussk  located in slovakia 
u 
s 
steel s financial results are primarily determined by the combined effects of shipment volume  selling prices  production costs and product mix 
while the operating results of our various businesses are affected by a number of business specific factors see item business steel industry background and competition  the primary drivers for u 
s 
steel are general economic conditions in north america  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other benefits costs  and raw materials iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc  tin and other metallic additions and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
u 
s 
steel s long term success depends on our ability to earn a competitive return on capital employed by implementing our strategy to be a world leader in safety and environmental stewardship  to continue to increase our value added product mix  to further expand our global business platform  to maintain a strong capital structure and liquidity position  to continue to improve our reliability and cost competitiveness  and to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce 
for a fuller description of our strategy  see item business description business strategy 
some of the other key issues which are impacting the global steel industry  including u 
s 
steel  are the level of unfunded pension and other benefits obligations  the degree of industry consolidation  the impact of production and consumption of steel in china and other developing countries  and the levels of steel imports into the markets we serve 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to employee benefits liabilities and assets held in trust relating to such liabilities  the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations and potential litigation claims and 
table of contents settlements 
management s estimates are based on historical experience  current business and market conditions  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
inventories lifo last in  first out is the predominant method of inventory costing for inventories in the united states and fifo first in  first out is the predominant method used in canada and europe 
the lifo method of inventory costing was used for percent and percent of consolidated inventories at december  and december   respectively 
changes in us gaap rules or tax law  such as the elimination of the lifo method of accounting for inventories  could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
equity method investments investments in entities over which u 
s 
steel has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are carried at u 
s 
steel s share of net assets plus loans  advances and our share of earnings less distributions 
differences in the basis of the investment and the underlying net asset value of the investee  if any  are amortized into earnings over the remaining useful life of the associated assets 
income from investees includes u 
s 
steel s share of income from equity method investments  which is generally recorded a month in arrears  except for significant and unusual items which are recorded in the period of occurrence 
gains or losses from changes in ownership of unconsolidated investees are recognized in the period of change 
intercompany profits and losses on transactions with equity investees have been eliminated in consolidation subject to lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
u 
s 
steel evaluates impairment of its equity method investments whenever circumstances indicate that a decline in value below carrying value is other than temporary 
under these circumstances  we would adjust the investment down to its estimated fair value  which then becomes its new carrying value 
pensions and other benefits the recording of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pensions and other benefits is based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 
u 
s 
steel s investment strategy for its us pension and other benefits plan assets provides for a diversified mix of public equities  high quality bonds and selected smaller investments in private equities  investment trusts and partnerships  and timber and mineral interests 
for its us pension and other benefits plans  u 
s 
steel has a target allocation for plan assets of percent and percent in equities  respectively  with the balance primarily invested in corporate bonds  treasury bonds and government backed mortgages 
u 
s 
steel believes that returns on equities over the long term will be higher than returns from fixed income securities as actual historical returns from u 
s 
steel s trusts have shown 
returns on bonds tend to offset some of the short term volatility of stocks 
both equity and fixed income investments are made across a broad range of industries and companies to provide protection against the impact of volatility in any single industry as well as company specific developments 
u 
s 
steel will use a percent assumed rate of return on assets for the development of net periodic cost for the main defined benefit pension plan and domestic opeb plans in this assumed rate of return is the same as the rate of return used for domestic expense and was determined by taking into account the intended asset mix and some moderation of the historical premiums that fixed income and equity investments have yielded above government bonds 
actual returns since the inception of the plans have exceeded this percent rate and while recent annual returns have been volatile  it is u 
s 
steel s expectation that rates will achieve this level in future periods 
for ussc defined benefit pension plans  u 
s 
steel s investment strategy is similar to its strategy for us plans  whereby the company seeks a diversified mix of large and mid cap equities  high quality corporate and 
table of contents government bonds and selected smaller investments with a target allocation for plan assets of percent equities 
u 
s 
steel will use a percent assumed rate of return on assets for the development of net periodic costs for the ussc defined benefit expense in the assumed rate of return is the same as the rate of return used for ussc expense 
to determine the discount rate used to measure our pension and other benefit obligations  certain corporate bond rates are utilized for both us gaap and funding purposes 
as a result of lower interest rates at december  and the continued volatility in the financial markets  u 
s 
steel decreased the discount rate used to measure both domestic pension and other benefits obligations to percent from percent 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which we estimate the pension and other benefits liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in setting the domestic rates  we utilize several aaa and aa corporate bond rates as an indication of interest rate movements and levels 
for canadian benefit plans  a discount rate was selected through a similar review process using canadian bond rates and indices and at december   u 
s 
steel decreased the discount rate to percent from percent for its canadian based pension and other benefits 
u 
s 
steel reviews its own actual historical rate experience and expectations of future health care cost trends to determine the escalation of per capita health care costs under u 
s 
steel s benefit plans 
about two thirds of our costs for the domestic united steelworkers usw participants retiree health benefits in the company s main domestic benefit plan are limited to a per capita dollar maximum calculation based on base year actual costs incurred under the main u 
s 
steel benefit plan for usw participants the cost cap 
the full effect of the cost cap was deferred in the labor agreements until after  the company s costs for a majority of usw retirees and their dependents are expected to remain fixed with the application of the cost cap and as a result  the cost impact of health care escalation on the company is projected to be limited for this group see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
for measurement of its domestic retiree medical plans where health care cost escalation is applicable  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
for measurement of its canadian retiree medical plans  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
net periodic pension cost  including multiemployer plans  is expected to total approximately million in compared to million in the decrease in expected expense in is primarily due to the natural maturation of our pension plans and a higher market related value of assets partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate 
total other benefits costs in are expected to be approximately million  compared to million in the decrease in expected expense in is primarily a result of the changes negotiated as part of the labor agreements 
a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical one percentage point change in the significant assumptions used in the pension and other benefits calculations is provided in the following table hypothetical rate increase decrease in millions expected return on plan assets incremental decrease increase in net periodic pension costs for discount rate incremental decrease increase in net periodic pension other benefits costs for pension other benefits obligations at december  health care cost escalation trend rates incremental increase decrease in service and interest costs components changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate used for accounting purposes do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension 
table of contents plans 
however  the discount rates required for minimum funding purposes are also based on corporate bond related indices and as such  the same general sensitivity concepts as above can be applied to increases or decreases to the funding obligations of the plans assuming the same hypothetical rate changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding legislation enacted in july that impacts the discount rate used for funding purposes 
for further cash flow discussion see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition  cash flows and liquidity liquidity 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed from businesses acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we have two reporting units that hold nearly all of our goodwill our flat rolled reporting unit and our texas operations reporting unit  which is part of our tubular operating segment 
on january   u 
s 
steel adopted asu which provides the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the first step of the two step impairment test see note to the consolidated financial statements 
u 
s 
steel completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation during the third quarter of and determined  on the basis of a number of economic  cost  market and other qualitative factors  including consideration of certain factors from the annual goodwill impairment evaluation  there was no indication of goodwill impairment for any of the reporting units 
if business conditions deteriorate or other factors have an adverse effect on our qualitative and quantitative estimates  inclusive of discounted future cash flows or assumed growth rates  or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization  future assessments of goodwill for impairment may result in impairment charges 
u 
s 
steel has determined that certain acquired intangible assets have indefinite useful lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
on january   u 
s 
steel adopted asu  which provides the option of allowing companies to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets is necessary  similar in approach to the goodwill impairment assessment noted above 
u 
s 
steel completed its evaluation of its indefinite lived water rights during the third quarter of and determined on the basis of qualitative factors  there was no indication of impairment 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets u 
s 
steel evaluates long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows 
we evaluate the impairment of long lived assets at the asset group level 
taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
a full valuation allowance was recorded for both our canadian and serbian deferred tax assets primarily due to cumulative losses in these jurisdictions in recent years 
accordingly  losses in canada and serbia do not generate a tax benefit for accounting purposes 
on january   u 
s 
steel sold usss and the serbian deferred tax asset and the offsetting valuation allowance were removed in connection with the sale 
if evidence changes and it becomes more likely than not that the company will realize the canadian deferred tax asset  the valuation allowance would be partially or fully reversed 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings because as of december   it remained management s intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings at december  amounted to approximately billion 
if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested  a us deferred tax liability of approximately million would have been required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss for items that have been or may be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  court case  tax ruling or other authoritative tax position  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   the total accrual for environmental remediation was million  excluding liabilities related to asset retirement obligations 
due to uncertainties inherent in remediation projects  it is possible that total remediation costs for active matters may exceed the accrued liability by as much as to percent

operating expenses union profit sharing costs year ended december dollars in millions allocated to segment results profit based amounts per the agreements with the usw are calculated and paid on a quarterly basis as a percentage of consolidated income from operations as defined in the agreements based on percent of profit between and per ton and percent of profit above per ton 
profit based amounts used to reduce retiree medical premiums are derived from the same initial profit calculation as these profit sharing amounts see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts above represent profit sharing amounts to active usw represented employees excluding employees of ussc and are included in cost of sales on the statement of operations 
pension and other benefits costs defined benefit and multiemployer pension plan costs totaled million in  million in and million during the million decrease in expense from to is primarily due to the natural maturation of our pension plans and a higher market related value of assets  partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate 
the million increase in expense from to is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized losses and lower asset returns  both of which relate to a lower market related value of assets caused by the recognition of remaining deferred investment losses 
u 
s 
steel calculates its market related value of assets such that investment gains or losses as compared to expected returns are recognized over a three year period 
to the extent that deferred gains and losses on plan assets are not yet reflected in this calculated value  the amounts do not impact expected asset returns or the net actuarial gains or losses subject to amortization within the net periodic pension expense calculation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the pension stabilization legislation enacted in includes a revised interest rate formula used to measure defined benefit pension obligations for calculating minimum annual contributions 
the new interest rate formula is expected to result in higher interest rates for minimum funding calculations compared to prior law over the next few years which will improve the funded status of our main defined benefit pension plan and reduce minimum required contributions 
u 
s 
steel made voluntary contributions to our main us defined benefit plan of million in 
table of contents and for several prior years 
u 
s 
steel will likely make voluntary contributions of similar amounts in future periods to mitigate potentially larger mandatory contributions in later years 
assuming future asset performance consistent with our expected long term earnings rate assumption of percent  we anticipate that the pension stabilization legislation interest rate changes will allow us to continue to make voluntary contributions of approximately million per year through before we could be required to contribute more than that amount should the current low interest rate environment persist 
the foregoing statements regarding future minimum required cash contributions to our main defined benefit pension plan are forward looking statements 
factors that may affect our future minimum required contributions to our main defined benefit pension plan include any voluntary contributions that we may make  future pension plan asset performance  actual interest rates under the law  and the impacts of business acquisitions or divestitures  union negotiated benefit changes and future government regulations

financial condition  cash flows and liquidity financial condition receivables decreased by million from december  primarily due to the sale of usss 
additionally  sales in the latter part of a period typically represent the majority of the receivables as of the end of that period 
the decrease in receivables at year end as compared to year end primarily reflected lower average realized prices in the period 
inventories decreased by million from december  primarily due to the sale of usss and a reduction in raw material inventories

long term debt  less unamortized discount increased by million due to the issuance of our million senior notes due  the issuance of million environmental improvement revenue bonds due august  and the renewal of the fairfield caster lease  offset by the redemption of our million senior notes in april and the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under ussk s unsecured revolving credit facilities 
employee benefits decreased by million from december  primarily due to a reduction of approximately million in our other post employment benefits opeb obligations as a result of benefit and plan design changes in the labor agreements as well as an increase in the market value of the assets in our pension and opeb plans in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  u

steel made a million voluntary pension contribution to its main defined benefit pension plan in and a million contribution to a restricted account within our trust for represented retiree health care and life insurance benefits 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the pension and opeb liabilities due to a reduced discount rate used to value the obligations 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  million in compared to million in and net cash used in operating activities of million in the improvement is primarily due to changes in working capital from to and improved operating results partially offset by increased employee benefit payments as further detailed below 
changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory production and purchases  which is affected by the length of our business cycles as well as our captive raw materials position  customer payments of accounts receivable and payments to vendors in the regular course of business

capital expenditures for are expected to total approximately million and remain focused largely on strategic  infrastructure and environmental projects 
during  we completed or neared completion on several key projects of strategic importance 
we have made significant progress to improve our coke self sufficiency and reduce our reliance on purchased coke for the steel making process through the application of advanced 
table of contents technologies  upgrades to our existing coke facilities and increased use of natural gas and pulverized coal in our operations 
we have completed the construction of a technologically and environmentally advanced battery at the mon valley works clairton plant with a projected capacity of  tons per year 
initial start up of the battery began in november with full production expected in the first quarter of we are constructing a carbon alloy facility at gary works  which utilizes an environmentally compliant  energy efficient and flexible production technology to produce a coke substitute product 
the facility has a projected capacity of  tons per year 
construction of the first of two modules is complete with production starting in and full production expected at the end of the third quarter of construction of the second module is projected to be completed in the fourth quarter of  with full production expected by the end of the second quarter of in an effort to increase our participation in the automotive market as vehicle emission and safety requirements become increasingly stringent  pro tec coating company  our joint venture in ohio with kobe steel  ltd  has a new automotive continuous annealing line cal under construction that is being financed at the joint venture level and is expected to begin operations in the first half of we are also continuing our efforts to implement an enterprise resource planning erp system to replace our existing information technology systems  which will enable us to operate more efficiently 
the completion of the erp project is expected to provide further opportunities to streamline  standardize and centralize business processes in order to maximize cost effectiveness  efficiency and control across our global operations 
we are also currently developing additional projects within our tubular segment  such as facility enhancements and additional premium connections that will further enhance our ability to support our tubular customers evolving needs 
over the longer term  we are considering business strategies to leverage our significant iron ore position in the united states and to exploit opportunities related to the availability of reasonably priced natural gas as an alternative to coke in the iron reduction process to improve our cost competitiveness  while reducing our dependence on coal and coke 
we are considering an expansion of our iron ore pellet operations at our keewatin  mn keetac facility which would increase our production capability by approximately million tons thereby increasing our iron ore self sufficiency 
the total cost of this project as currently conceived is broadly estimated to be approximately million 
final permitting for the expansion was completed in december we are examining alternative iron and steel making technologies such as gas based  direct reduced iron and electric arc furnace eaf steelmaking 
our capital investments in the future may reflect such strategies  although we expect that iron and steel making through the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace manufacturing processes will remain our primary processing technology for the long term 
the foregoing statements regarding expected capital expenditures  capital projects and expected benefits from the implementation of the erp project are forward looking statements 
factors that may affect our capital spending and the associated projects include i levels of cash flow from operations  ii changes in tax laws  iii general economic conditions  iv steel industry conditions  v cost and availability of capital  vi receipt of necessary permits  vii unforeseen hazards such as contractor performance  material shortages  weather conditions  explosions or fires  and viii the requirements of applicable laws and regulations 
there is also a risk that the completed projects will not produce at the expected levels and within the costs currently projected 
predictions regarding benefits resulting from the implementation of the erp project are subject to uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements

s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet clean air act caa obligations and similar obligations in europe and canada  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent that these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major north american and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that our relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills  some foreign steel producers particularly in developing economies such as china and producers of materials which compete with steel  all of which may not be required to incur equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to our prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
many of our competitors do not have similar historical liabilities 
our us facilities are subject to the us environmental standards  including the caa  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as well as state and local laws and regulations 
ussc is subject to the environmental laws of canada  which are comparable to environmental standards in the united states 
environmental regulation in canada is an area of shared responsibility between the federal government and the provincial governments  which in turn delegate certain matters to municipal governments 
federal environmental statutes include the federal canadian environmental protection act  and the fisheries act 
various provincial statutes regulate environmental matters such as the release and remediation of hazardous substances  waste storage  treatment and disposal  and air emissions 
as in the united states  canadian environmental laws federal  provincial and local are undergoing revision and becoming more stringent 
the canadian and ontario governments have identified for remediation a sediment deposit  commonly referred to as randle reef  in hamilton harbor near ussc s hamilton works  for which the regulatory agencies estimate expenditures of approximately c million approximately million 
the national and provincial governments have each allocated c million approximately million for this project 
local sources  including industry  have also agreed to provide funding of c million approximately million for this project 
ussc has committed to contribute approximately  tons of hot rolled steel and to fund c million approximately million 
the steel contribution is expected to be made in as of december   u 
s 
steel has an accrued liability of approximately million reflecting the contribution commitment 
ussk is subject to the environmental laws of slovakia and the eu 
a related law of the eu commonly known as registration  evaluation  authorization and restriction of chemicals  regulation reach requires the registration of certain substances that are produced in the eu or imported into the eu 
although ussk is currently compliant with reach  this regulation is becoming increasingly stringent 
slovakia is also currently considering a law implementing an eu waste framework directive that would more strictly regulate waste disposal and increase fees for waste disposed of in landfills including privately owned landfills 
the intent of the waste directive is to encourage recycling and because slovakia has not adopted implementing legislation  we cannot estimate the full financial impact of this prospective legislation at this time 
the eu s industry emission directive will require implementation of eu determined best available techniques bats to reduce environmental impacts as well as compliance with bat associated emission levels 
it contains operational requirements for air emissions  waste water discharges  solid waste disposal and energy conservation  dictates certain operating practices and imposes stricter emission limits 
producers will be required to be in compliance with the iron and steel bat by march  we are currently evaluating the costs of complying with bat  but our most recent broad estimate of likely capital expenditures is approximately million over the 
table of contents to period 
we are currently investigating the possibility of obtaining eu grants to fund a portion of those capital expenditures 
we also believe there will be increased operating costs  such as increased energy and maintenance costs  but we are currently unable to reliably estimate this amount 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations  which in recent years have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations and similar obligations in europe and canada 
in the future  compliance with carbon dioxide co emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances  restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems 
since it is difficult to predict what requirements will ultimately be imposed in the united states  canada and europe  it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on u 
s 
steel  but it could be substantial 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major north american and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  if the final requirements do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions  our competitive position relative to mini mills will be adversely impacted 
our competitive position compared to producers in developing nations  such as china and india  will be harmed unless such nations require commensurate reductions in co emissions 
competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted 
the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
many of our competitors  including north american producers  or their successors  that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such matters

steel does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures including operating and maintenance and remediation will materially increase in u 
s 
steel s environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in  million of which is related to projects at usse 
predictions beyond can only be broad based estimates  which have varied  and will continue to vary  due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements  the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies to remediate sites  among other matters 
based upon currently identified projects  u 
s 
steel anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately million in  including million for usse  however  actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 
asbestos litigation as of december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active asbestos cases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
almost  or approximately percent  of these claims are currently pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
we are unable to estimate the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on u 
s 
steel s financial condition  although the resolution of such matters could significantly impact results of operations for a particular period 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  most asbestos containing material was removed or remediated at u 
s 
steel facilities many years ago  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals

table of contents general litigation in a series of lawsuits filed in federal court in the northern district of illinois beginning september   individual direct or indirect buyers of steel products have asserted that eight steel manufacturers  including u 
s 
steel  conspired in violation of antitrust laws to restrict the domestic production of raw steel and thereby to fix  raise  maintain or stabilize the price of steel products in the united states 
the cases are filed as class actions and claim treble damages for the period to present  but do not allege any damage amounts 
u 
s 
steel will vigorously defend these lawsuits and does not believe that it is probable a liability regarding these matters has been incurred 
we are unable to estimate a range of possible loss at this time 
on august   the us government  joined by the states of illinois  indiana and michigan  filed a complaint in the northern district of indiana alleging various caa and state air regulatory violations that were to have allegedly occurred at gary works  granite city works  and great lakes works  our three integrated iron and steel facilities located in epa region v 
the complaint alleges that gary works failed to obtain the proper pre construction permit for a routine reline of its blast furnace no 
in  and that the three facilities failed to meet certain operational  maintenance  opacity  and recordkeeping requirements under the caa and its implementing regulations 
the complaint requests relief in the form of statutory penalties for each violation and for injunctive relief 
u 
s 
steel believes that the claims asserted in the complaint are not justified and are without statutory foundation 
on september   u 
s 
steel filed a motion to dismiss the us government s claims for relief regarding the reline of the gary blast furnace no 
and filed an answer to the remaining allegations in the complaint 
u 
s 
steel will continue to vigorously defend against these claims 
at this time  the potential outcome is not reasonably estimable 
u 
s 
steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment  certain of which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the u 
s 
steel financial statements 
however  management believes that u 
s 
steel will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to u 
s 
steel 
the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
outlook for first quarter we continue to be challenged by uncertain global economic and steel market conditions 
we expect a slight improvement in the european and tubular segment operating results with flat rolled segment results expected to be near breakeven 
total reportable segment and other businesses operating results are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter 
we expect flat rolled segment results to be near breakeven in the first quarter 
steel buyers in north america continued to exhibit caution early in the year  but recent increases in our daily order entry rates suggest increased spot market demand as the quarter progresses 
we expect higher shipments in the first quarter than the fourth quarter with increases across many of our industry segments 
average spot prices are expected to be higher than the fourth quarter as recently announced price increases take effect 
lower prices for market based contracts  which tend to lag the spot market  are expected to offset the higher spot market prices with overall first quarter average realized prices for the flat rolled segment being comparable to the fourth quarter 
raw materials costs are expected to decrease slightly as lower coal prices are partially offset by higher scrap prices 
total operating costs are expected to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter 
first quarter results for our european segment are projected to improve compared to the fourth quarter due to a significant increase in shipments 
despite continued economic challenges  shipments are anticipated to increase due to additional contract volume and improving spot market activity caused by service center and distributor restocking 
average realized prices are expected to decrease due to a higher mix of hot rolled shipments as well as the effect of lower firm contract prices  which are partially offset by increasing spot market prices 
iron ore costs are projected to increase in the first quarter 

table of contents we expect first quarter results for our tubular segment to improve compared to the fourth quarter due to decreased operating costs and a slight increase in shipments as drilling activity begins to improve 
average realized prices are expected to be slightly lower as compared to the fourth quarter  while operating costs are expected to decrease due to reduced repairs and maintenance costs and improved operating efficiencies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk u 
s 
steel is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations  including financial  market  political  and economic risks 
the following discussion provides information regarding u 
s 
steel s exposure to the risks of changing foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
u 
s 
steel may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks 
the use of derivative instruments is subject to our corporate governance policies 
these instruments are used solely to mitigate market exposure and would not be used for trading or speculative purposes 
u 
s 
steel may elect to use hedge accounting for certain commodity or currency transactions 
for those transactions  the impact of the effective portion of the hedging instrument will be recognized in other comprehensive income until the transaction is settled 
once the transaction is settled  the effect of the hedged item will be recognized in income 
for further information regarding derivative instruments see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk u 
s 
steel  through usse and ussc  is subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the euro and the canadian dollar 
u 
s 
steel historically has made limited use of forward currency contracts to manage exposure to certain currency price fluctuations 
u 
s 
steel has not elected to use hedge accounting for these contracts 
foreign currency derivative instruments have been marked to market and the resulting gains or losses recognized in the current period in net interest and other financial costs 
at december  and december   u 
s 
steel had open euro forward sales contracts for us dollars total notional value of approximately million and million  respectively 
a percent increase in the december  euro forward rates would result in a million charge to income 
the fair value of our derivatives is determined using level inputs  which are defined as significant other observable inputs 
the inputs used include quotes from counterparties that are corroborated with market sources 
we utilize euro us dollar derivatives to mitigate our currency exposure at usse 
volatility in the foreign currency markets could have significant implications for u 
s 
steel as a result of foreign currency accounting remeasurement effects 
future foreign currency impacts will depend upon changes in currencies and the extent to which we engage in derivatives transactions 
for additional information on u

steel s foreign currency exchange activity  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk and related risks in the normal course of our business  u 
s 
steel is exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase  production or sale of steel products 
u 
s 
steel is also exposed to price risk related to the purchase  production or sale of coal  coke  natural gas  steel scrap  iron ore and pellets  and zinc  tin and other nonferrous metals used as raw materials 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details on u 
s 
steel s derivatives 

table of contents u 
s 
steel s market risk strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and services and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand  however  u 
s 
steel has made forward physical purchases to manage exposure to price risk related to the purchases of natural gas and certain non ferrous metals used in the production process 
u 
s 
steel held commodity contracts for natural gas forward buys placed for and that qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption with a total notional value of approximately million at december  total commodity contracts for natural gas forward buys placed for at december  represent approximately percent of our expected north american natural gas requirements 
interest rate risk u 
s 
steel is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations on certain of our non derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percent increase decrease in year end and interest rates on the fair value of u 
s 
steel s non derivative financial instruments is provided in the following table dollars in millions non derivative financial instruments a fair value b increase in fair value c fair value b increase in fair value c financial assets investments and long term receivables d financial liabilities debt e f a fair values of cash and cash equivalents  current accounts and notes receivable  receivables sold to third party conduits  accounts payable  bank checks outstanding  accrued interest and borrowings under the receivables purchase agreement approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments 
accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see note to the consolidated financial statements for carrying value of instruments 
c reflects  by class of financial instrument  the estimated incremental effect of a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates at december  and  on the fair value of u 
s 
steel s non derivative financial instruments 
for financial liabilities  this assumes a percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of u 
s 
steel s long term debt at december  and december  d fair value was based on level inputs which were discounted cash flows 
u 
s 
steel is subject to market risk and liquidity risk related to its investments 
e excludes capital lease obligations 
f fair value was determined using level inputs which were derived from quoted market prices and is based on the yield on public debt where available or current borrowing rates available for financings with similar terms and maturities 
u 
s 
steel s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio would unfavorably affect our results and cash flows only to the extent that we elected to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value 
safe harbor u 
s 
steel s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management s opinion about risks associated with u 
s 
steel s use of derivative instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for steel products and certain raw materials 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes with respect to u
