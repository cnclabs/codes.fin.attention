item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 
we are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies  helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care 
we deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain 
we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers 
our operations are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other 
recent developments on march   we  walgreens and alliance boots entered into various agreements and arrangements  including a ten year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and us pursuant to which walgreens will source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from us  an agreement which provides us with the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through walgreens boots alliance development gmbh  a global sourcing joint venture between walgreens and alliance boots  opportunities to accelerate our efforts to grow our specialty and manufacturer services businesses domestically and internationally  and agreements and arrangements pursuant to which walgreens and alliance boots together have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase a minority equity position in us and gain associated representation on our board of directors in certain circumstances 
we were already distributing mail order and other pharmaceutical products for walgreens 
the ten year distribution agreement  which was effective as of september   expanded our relationship to include the distribution of branded and generic pharmaceutical products for walgreens 
branded pharmaceutical distribution began on september   and beginning in fiscal  we expect our distribution for walgreens to increasingly include generic pharmaceutical products that walgreens currently self distributes 
in connection with these arrangements  we entered into a framework agreement with walgreens and alliance boots  dated as of march   pursuant to which i walgreens and alliance boots together were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen corporation  beginning with the right  but not the obligation  to purchase up to  shares of our common stock approximately of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance  assuming the exercise in full of the warrants  as defined below in open market transactions  with the right to designate up to two members of our board of directors upon achieving specified ownership levels  ii walgreens pharmacy strategies  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of walgreens  was issued a a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share exercisable during a six month period beginning in march  and b a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share exercisable during a six month period beginning in march  and iii alliance boots luxembourg s rl  a wholly owned subsidiary of alliance boots  was issued a a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share exercisable during a six month period beginning in march and b a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share exercisable during a six month period beginning in march collectively  the warrants 
the warrants collectively represented approximately of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance  assuming exercise in full of the warrants 
the number of shares which may be purchased in the open market is subject to increase in certain circumstances if the market price of our common stock is less than the exercise price of the first tranche of warrants when those warrants are exercisable in future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing shareholders 
in addition  prior to the exercise of the warrants  any dilutive effect of the warrants will be reflected in our diluted earnings per share calculation 
the parties and affiliated entities also entered into certain related agreements governing relations between and among the parties thereto  including the amerisourcebergen shareholders agreement  dated as of march   among walgreens  alliance boots and us  described in our current report on form k filed on march  please refer to our current report on form k filed on march  for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements 
we currently expect earnings accretion from the pharmaceutical distribution agreement and the generics and related pharmaceutical products global sourcing agreement for fiscal year  excluding certain expenses and non recurring costs related to the transaction 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements on page and risk factors in item a 
pharmaceutical distribution segment the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments  which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg 
servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel  the pharmaceutical distribution segment operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products and generic pharmaceuticals  over the counter healthcare products  home healthcare supplies and equipment  and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers  including acute care hospitals and health systems  independent and chain retail pharmacies  mail order pharmacies  medical clinics  long term care and other alternate site pharmacies  and other customers 
abdc also provides pharmacy management  staffing and other consulting services  scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment  medication and supply dispensing cabinets  and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers 
additionally  abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 

table of contents absg  through a number of operating businesses  provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology  and to other healthcare providers  including dialysis clinics 
absg also distributes plasma and other blood products  injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines 
additionally  absg provides third party logistics and outcomes research  and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 
our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases  such as cancer  diabetes  and multiple sclerosis 
specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring 
we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors 
however  we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 
both abdc and absg distribute specialty drugs to their customers  with the principal difference between these two operating segments being that absg operates distribution facilities that focus primarily on complex disease treatment regimens 
therefore  a product distributed from one of absg distribution facilities results in revenue reported under absg  and a product distributed from one of abdc distribution centers results in revenue reported under abdc 
essentially all of absg sales consist of specialty pharmaceutical products 
abdc sales of specialty pharmaceutical products are a relatively small component of its overall revenue 
other other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment and the world courier group  inc world courier operating segment 
the results of operations of our abcs and world courier operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure  and  therefore  have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 
abcs  through a number of operating businesses  provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs  outcomes research  contract field staffing  patient assistance and copay assistance programs  adherence programs  risk mitigation services  and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers 
world courier  which operates in over countries  is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry 
results of operations year ended september  compared with year ended september  revenue fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other intersegment eliminations revenue revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to the revenue growth of both pharmaceutical distribution and other 
we currently expect our revenue in fiscal to increase between and 
our expected growth rate is driven primarily by our new distribution contract with walgreens  which became effective september  fiscal will include eleven incremental months of brand drug distribution and the phase in of generic drug distribution to walgreens 
we are also forecasting a modest increase in revenue from the implementation of the affordable care act 
our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends  including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers  general economic conditions in the united states  competition within the industry  customer consolidation  changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices  increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers  and changes in federal government rules and regulations 
pharmaceutical distribution segment the pharmaceutical distribution segment grew its revenue by from the prior fiscal year 
intrasegment revenues between abdc and absg have been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution revenue 
these revenues primarily consisted of absg sales directly to abdc customer sites or absg sales to abdc facilities 
total intrasegment revenues were billion and billion in the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 

table of contents abdc revenue of billion increased from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations 
the increase in abdc revenue was primarily due to increased sales to express scripts of billion and walgreens of billion in the fiscal year ended september  the increased sales were offset in part by the loss of a food and drug retail group purchasing organization gpo customer  which resulted in a billion decrease in revenue in the fiscal year ended september  additionally  revenue was favorably impacted by an increase in brand name pharmaceutical prices and was unfavorably impacted by an increase in the use of lower priced generic pharmaceuticals 
the increased use of generic pharmaceuticals was the result of over brand to generic conversions in fiscal absg revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations primarily due to the growth in its blood products  vaccine  and physician office distribution businesses  and its third party logistics business 
the physician office distribution business benefitted from increased sales of an ophthalmology drug in fiscal absg revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in sales to community oncology practices 
the majority of absg revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology 
community oncologists and other specialty physicians that administer drugs under medicare part b experienced declining reimbursement rates for specialty pharmaceutical drugs in fiscal as a result  some physician practices consolidated or sold their businesses to hospitals 
under federal sequestration legislation  medicare physician reimbursement rates for part b drugs were further reduced on april  while we service the needs of many hospitals  the continuing shift in this service channel has reduced oncology revenue 
refer to item a 
risk factors for a more detailed description of this business risk 
absg business may continue to be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs 
since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians  any changes affecting this service channel could result in additional revenue reductions 
a number of our contracts with customers or group purchasing organizations gpos are typically subject to expiration each year 
we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended  renewed  or replaced 
during the fiscal year ended september   no significant contracts expired 
over the next twelve months  there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire 
other revenue in other increased million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the million incremental revenue contributions from world courier  which was acquired in april gross profit fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other gross profit gross profit decreased  or approximately million  from the prior fiscal year 
our cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
due to the additional branded inventory that we were required to purchase to service the walgreens contract  approximately billion  and the impact the branded inventory had on our annual inflation index  as well as higher brand drug price inflation and lower generic drug price deflation  we recorded a lifo charge of million in the fiscal year ended september  in fiscal  our lifo charge will also be impacted by the walgreens on boarding 
pharmaceutical distribution gross profit decreased  or approximately million  from the prior fiscal year 
excluding the fiscal lifo charge  pharmaceutical distribution gross profit decreased by million in the fiscal year ended september  excluding the fiscal lifo charge  this decrease was primarily due to the lower gross profit related to the express scripts contract  the loss of a food and drug retail gpo customer  the lower number of generic launches  and the reduced contribution from sales of certain specialty oncology drugs 
this decrease was offset  in part  by stronger price appreciation related to generic drugs and the growth of our non oncology specialty distribution businesses 
in the current fiscal year  we recognized a gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers  in comparison to a gain of million in the prior fiscal year 
these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 
we are unable to estimate future gains  if any  that we will recognize as a result of antitrust litigation settlements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of revenue  pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of in the fiscal year ended september  decreased basis points from the prior fiscal year 
excluding the fiscal lifo charge  pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of in the fiscal year ended september  decreased basis points from the prior fiscal year 
excluding the fiscal lifo charge  the pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin decline in the fiscal year ended september  was primarily due to lower gross profit margin related to the current express scripts contract  the loss of a food and drug retail gpo customer  and competitive pressures on customer margins 

table of contents gross profit in other increased by million in the fiscal year ended september  the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the million incremental contributions made by our fiscal acquisition of world courier 
as a percentage of revenue  other gross profit margin of in the fiscal year ended september  increased from in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to the gross profit contributions from our fiscal acquisition of world courier 
operating expenses fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change distribution  selling and administrative depreciation and amortization warrants employee severance  litigation and other total operating expenses distribution  selling and administrative expense in fiscal increased  or approximately million  from the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the incremental operating costs of our fiscal acquisition of world courier and additional costs to support the on boarding of our new distribution agreement with walgreens 
depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to our fiscal acquisition of world courier and due to an increase in capital projects 
amortization expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to our fiscal acquisition of world courier 
warrant expense was million in the fiscal year ended september  the warrants were issued in march in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with walgreens and alliance boots 
refer to the critical accounting policies and estimates warrants on page for a more detailed description of the accounting for the warrants 
future warrant expense could fluctuate significantly 
employee severance  litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september  included million of deal related transaction costs primarily related to professional fees with respect to the walgreens and alliance boots transaction and million of employee severance and facility closure costs 
in fiscal  we introduced a number of initiatives  some of which were made possible as a result of efficiencies gained through our erp implementation  to improve our operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions 
in connection with these initiatives  we recorded million of employee severance and other related costs 
other costs included an estimated million liability to exit our participation in a multi employer pension plan resulting from a abdc distribution facility closure in fiscal in addition  we incurred million of deal related transaction costs in connection with business combinations 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were in fiscal  an increase of basis points from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to the warrant expense and the addition of our fiscal world courier acquisition  which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
for the pharmaceutical distribution segment  as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were down basis points from the prior fiscal year 
operating income fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other warrants employee severance  litigation and other operating income segment operating income is evaluated before warrant expense and employee severance  litigation and other 
pharmaceutical distribution operating income decreased  or approximately million from the prior fiscal year 
excluding the fiscal lifo charge  pharmaceutical distribution operating income decreased  or approximately million from the prior fiscal year 
excluding the fiscal lifo charge  as a percentage of revenue  pharmaceutical distribution operating income margin was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the basis point decline in pharmaceutical distribution operating margin from the prior fiscal year was due to decreased contributions from generic launches  a shift in customer mix towards lower margin business in abdc most notably the express scripts contract  the loss of a food and drug retail gpo customer  and a decline in the operating margin of our oncology business 

table of contents operating income in other increased million from the prior fiscal year due to the incremental contribution made by our fiscal world courier acquisition and an increase in operating income from our abcs businesses 
interest expense  interest income  and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal and were as follows in thousands amount weighted average interest rate amount weighted average interest rate interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense decreased from the prior fiscal year due to a decrease of million in average borrowings  primarily due to the repayment of our million  senior notes in september  offset  in part  by the issuance of our million senior notes in november our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings  interest rates  amendments to our current borrowing facilities  and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 
we currently expect our interest expense to be higher in fiscal due to increased short term borrowings to fund working capital needs associated with the on boarding of the walgreens business 
income taxes in fiscal reflect an effective tax rate of  compared to in the prior fiscal year 
our effective tax rate is higher in fiscal because a portion of the warrant expense is not tax deductible 
excluding the impact of warrant expense  our effective tax rate in fiscal was 
our future effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly depending upon the quarterly valuation of the warrants for financial reporting purposes 
excluding the impact of warrant expense  we expect that our effective tax rate in fiscal will be in the low range 
income from continuing operations of million in the fiscal year ended september  decreased from the prior fiscal year 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of in the fiscal year ended september  decreased from in the prior fiscal year 
excluding the fiscal lifo charge and warrant expense  income from continuing operations was million in the fiscal year ended september   a decrease from the prior fiscal year 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  excluding the fiscal lifo charge and warrant expense  was in the fiscal year ended september   a increase from the prior fiscal year 
excluding the fiscal lifo charge and warrant expense  the percentage difference between the change in diluted earnings per share and the change in income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended september  was due to the reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding  primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources  net of the impact of stock option exercises 
loss income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for all periods presented includes the operating results of andersonbrecon ab and amerisourcebergen canada corporation abcc 
the loss before income taxes in the fiscal year ended september  includes an abcc goodwill impairment charge and the loss on the sale of abcc 
this loss is net of a gain on the sale of ab 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  revenue fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other intersegment eliminations revenue revenue of billion in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year as abdc revenue declined  and was partially offset by the revenue increase of absg 
additionally  our fiscal acquisitions  with theracom and world courier being the largest contributors  added to our revenue growth in the fiscal year ended september  
table of contents pharmaceutical distribution segment abdc revenue decreased from the prior fiscal year 
the decline in abdc revenue was primarily due to the increase in use of lower priced generics  a reduction in chain customer revenue primarily due to the previously announced loss of one of our larger retail customers  the former long drugs  which was acquired by a customer of one of our competitors and did not renew its contract prior to september   and lower sales to its largest customer 
the decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in brand name pharmaceutical prices 
absg revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in its third party logistics business and growth in its vaccine and physician office distribution business  which has benefited from sales of a new ophthalmology drug 
absg revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of certain specialty oncology drugs 
other revenue in other increased billion from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the million contribution from our theracom and world courier acquisitions 
gross profit fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other gross profit gross profit in fiscal increased million from the prior fiscal year 
our cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
we recorded a lifo charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our lifo charge in fiscal was lower than the prior fiscal year charge due to higher brand inventory sales prior to the end of our fiscal year 
pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased or approximately million from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to the solid growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs and brand price increases  which were offset  in part  by the reduced contribution from the sales of certain specialty oncology drugs  and by competitive pressures on customer margins 
as expected  in fiscal  the gross profit contributions from the sales of oxaliplatin  gemcitabine  and docetaxel all generic oncology drugs were approximately million lower than the prior fiscal year 
we had no sales of oxaliplatin in fiscal until mid august and  therefore  gross profit on the sale of oxaliplatin was significantly lower than in fiscal in fiscal  the gross profit decline from the above mentioned three specialty generic drugs was partially offset by the gross profit contribution from over abdc brand to generic product conversions 
in fiscal  we recognized a gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this compared to a recognized gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the prior fiscal year 
these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 
additionally  in fiscal  gross profit was impacted by a non recurring million benefit in connection with a customer being acquired by a third party 
as a percentage of revenue  pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of in fiscal increased basis points from the prior fiscal year 
the gross profit margin increase was due to the solid growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs  which was partially offset by the decline in gross profit relating to the above mentioned specialty oncology generic drugs 
additionally  the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  as noted above  contributed basis points to our gross profit margin in fiscal gross profit in other increased by million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to the contributions made by our fiscal acquisitions primarily world courier and theracom 
as a percentage of revenue  other gross profit margin of in fiscal decreased from in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the lower gross profit margin of our fiscal acquisition of theracom 

table of contents operating expenses fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change distribution  selling and administrative depreciation and amortization employee severance  litigation and other intangible asset impairments total operating expenses distribution  selling and administrative expense in fiscal increased due to the operating costs of our recently acquired companies and was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses within our pharmaceutical distribution segment and a decrease in our bad debt expense 
depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the implementation of our new erp system 
amortization expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the newly acquired intangible assets resulting from the theracom and world courier acquisitions 
in fiscal  we introduced a number of initiatives  some of which were made possible as a result of efficiencies gained through our erp implementation  to improve our operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions 
in connection with these initiatives  we recorded million of severance and other related costs 
other costs included an estimated million liability to exit our participation in a multi employer pension plan resulting from a planned abdc distribution facility closure in fiscal in addition  we incurred million of acquisition costs related to business combinations 
in fiscal  we introduced our energiz program  which encompassed a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity  improve customer contractual compliance  and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations 
employee severance  litigation and other for fiscal included employee severance costs of million related to our energiz program  a million charge related to the preliminary settlement of a qui tam legal matter and million of acquisition costs related to business combinations 
we incurred a million charge related to intangible asset impairments in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were in fiscal  up basis points from the prior fiscal year 
this was primarily due to our recent acquisitions 
for the pharmaceutical distribution segment  as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were down basis points from the prior fiscal year 
operating income fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other employee severance  litigation and other operating income segment operating income is evaluated before employee severance  litigation and other 
pharmaceutical distribution operating income increased million from the prior fiscal year due to the decrease in its operating expenses  offset in part by a decrease in its gross profit 
operating income in other increased million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the million of contributions made by our recent acquisitions  primarily world courier and theracom 
the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  the costs relating to employee severance  litigation and other  and the asset impairments was to decrease operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in both fiscal and other income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal primarily related to a gain resulting from payments received in excess of amounts accrued on a note receivable relating to a prior business disposition 
interest expense  interest income  and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal and were as follows in thousands amount weighted average interest rate amount weighted average interest rate interest expense interest income interest expense  net 
table of contents interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of million in average borrowings  primarily due to the november issuance of our new million senior notes due in addition  interest costs capitalized related to our business transformation project of million and million in fiscal and  respectively had the effect of reducing interest expense for those periods 
our average invested cash was billion during both fiscal and despite the similar levels of average cash  interest income was lower in fiscal due to an increase in the amount of cash held in non interest bearing cash accounts 
cash held in these accounts partially offset bank fees 
income taxes in fiscal reflect an effective tax rate of  compared to in the prior fiscal year 
income from continuing operations of million in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income and was offset in part by the increases in interest expense and income taxes 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of in fiscal increased from per share in the prior fiscal year 
the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding  primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources  net of the impact of stock option exercises 
loss income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  of million and million  represents the operating results of andersonbrecon and abcc in both fiscal and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for a complete list of significant accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  and our customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise 
we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote 
each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly 
there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september    and and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods 
the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts  net of write offs  recoveries and other adjustments 
schedule ii of this form k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
an increase or decrease of in the allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately million 
supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives  including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them 
these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims  historical experience with the suppliers  the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us 
we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances 
an increase or decrease of in the supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately million 
the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 
loss contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we become involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings  government subpoenas  and government investigations  including antitrust  commercial  environmental  product liability  intellectual property  regulatory  employment discrimination  and other matters 
significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters  and some matters may require years to resolve 
we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued 
if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material  we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements 
we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made 

table of contents merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost for approximately and of our inventories at september  and  respectively  has been determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
if we had used the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been approximately million and million higher than the amounts reported at september  and  respectively 
we recorded a lifo charge of million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 
the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences  many of which are difficult to predict 
our lifo charge in fiscal was significant due to the additional branded inventory we were required to purchase for the new walgreens distribution contract and the impact the branded inventory had on our annual inflation index as well as higher brand drug price inflation and lower generic drug price deflation 
in fiscal  our lifo charge will also be impacted by the walgreens on boarding 
business combinations the purchase price of an acquired company  including the fair value of any contingent consideration  is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values  with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships  trade names  existing technology  and other intangible assets  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual events 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  primarily trademarks and trade names  are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment at least annually 
for the purpose of these impairment tests  we can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests in the current year 
we may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods 
the first step in the quantitative process for the goodwill impairment test is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step must be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
we would be required to record any such impairment losses 
we identify our reporting units at the operating segment level 
generally  goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides 
we utilize a combination of income and market based approaches to valuation for its reporting units 
the income approach to valuation relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate 
we believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction 
the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth  operating margins  depreciation  amortization and working capital requirements  which are based upon our long range plan 
the discount rate is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt  including a risk premium 
while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions  actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances 
while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions  our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date 
we estimate the fair value of our indefinite lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method 
we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets 
the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 
we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal   and  and  as a result  recorded million of impairment charges in fiscal 
table of contents share based compensation we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense  which involves the use of several assumptions  including expected term of the option  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors  such as implied volatility 
warrants we account for the warrants issued to walgreens and alliance boots in accordance with the guidance for equity based payments to non employees 
the various agreements and arrangements with walgreens and alliance boots established various performance commitments that they must satisfy during the vesting periods of the warrants  and if not fulfilled  we have the right to cancel the warrants 
using a binomial lattice model approach  the fair value of the warrants was initially measured at the date of issuance  and is being expensed over the three and four year vesting periods as an operating expense 
the fair value of the warrants are re measured at the end of each quarterly reporting period  and an adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations to record the impact as if the newly measured fair value of the awards had been used in recognizing expense starting when the awards were originally issued and through the remeasurement date 
in total  the warrants were valued at million as of september  the valuation of the warrants considers our common stock price and various assumptions  such as the volatility of our common stock  the expected remaining life of the warrants  the expected dividend yield  and the risk free interest rate 
as a result  future warrant expense could fluctuate significantly 
a portion of the warrant expense is not tax deductible  therefore  our future effective income tax rate could fluctuate significantly depending on the valuation of the warrants for financial reporting purposes 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and uncertain tax positions reflect management assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by million in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table illustrates our debt structure at september   including availability under the multi currency revolving credit facility  the receivables securitization facility  and the revolving credit note in thousands outstanding balance additional availability fixed rate debt  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due total fixed rate debt variable rate debt multi currency revolving credit facility due receivables securitization facility due revolving credit note total variable rate debt total debt along with our cash balances  our aggregate availability under our multi currency revolving credit facility  our receivables securitization facility  and the revolving credit note provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements 
we have a billion multi currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to expire in july  the multi currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
interest on borrowings under the multi currency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from basis points to basis points over libor euribor bankers acceptance stamping fee  as applicable basis points over libor euribor bankers acceptance stamping fee at september  
additionally  interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate 
we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multi currency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on our debt rating  ranging from basis points to basis points  annually  of the total commitment basis points at september  
we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multi currency revolving credit facility at any time 
the multi currency revolving credit facility contains covenants  including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test  as well as others that impose limitations on  among other things  indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales  with which we are compliant as of september  we have a commercial paper program whereby we may  from time to time  issue short term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to million at any one time 
amounts available under the program may be borrowed  repaid  and re borrowed from time to time 
the maturities on the notes will vary  but may not exceed days from the date of issuance 
the notes will bear interest rates  if interest bearing  or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts 
the commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our multi currency revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at september  we have a million receivables securitization facility receivables securitization facility  which is scheduled to expire in june we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to million  subject to lender approval  for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters 
interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper or libor plus a program fee of basis points 
we currently pay an unused fee of basis points  annually  to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility 
at september   there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables securitization facility  which contains similar covenants to the multi currency revolving credit facility 
in connection with the receivables securitization facility  abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation  a wholly owned special purpose entity  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions 
abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility 
after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected  additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility 
we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 
we have an uncommitted  unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note revolving credit note for an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million 
the revolving credit note provides us with the ability to request short term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed million at any time outstanding

interest on the notes  the notes and the notes is payable semiannually in arrears 
all of the senior notes rank pari passu to the multi currency revolving credit facility 

table of contents our operating results have generated cash flow  which  together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers  has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements  and to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  repayment of debt  the payment of interest on outstanding debt  dividends  and repurchases of shares of our common stock 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital  fund the repayment of debt  fund the payment of interest on debt  fund repurchases of our common stock  fund the payment of dividends  finance acquisitions  and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities 
in may  our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to million shares of our common stock  subject to market conditions 
during the quarter ended december   we purchased million of our common stock to complete our authorization under this million share repurchase program 
in november  our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to million shares of our common stock  subject to market conditions 
during the fiscal year ended september   we purchased million of our common stock under the share repurchase program 
as of september   we had million of availability remaining on the million share repurchase program 
on august   our board of directors approved a new program allowing us to purchase up to million additional shares of our common stock  subject to market conditions 
we currently expect to purchase approximately million of our common stock in fiscal  subject to market conditions 
future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements 
if walgreens and or alliance boots exercise their rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the warrants that we issued to them  the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we intend to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect that exercise of the warrants could have by hedging a portion of our future obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock for our own account over time 
in june  we commenced our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it will execute a series of issuer capped call transactions capped calls 
the capped calls give us the right to buy approximately of the shares of our common stock subject to the warrants at specified prices at maturity  should the warrants be exercised in and and assuming our future share price does not exceed the capped call limits 
if our future share price at the exercise dates is lower than we expect  then our use of capital for the purchase of the capped calls would be ineffective 
to the extent the capped calls do not mitigate the dilutive effect of the warrants  we intend to consider repurchasing additional shares of our common stock 
the amount of dilution that we would be able to mitigate will depend on the relative costs and benefits of such a transaction  considering factors such as our financial performance  the current and future share price of our common stock  our expected cash flows  competing priorities for capital  and overall market conditions 
as of september   we purchased capped calls on million shares of our common stock for a total premium of million  of which million was paid as of september  and the remainder is accrued as of that date 
we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund the remaining cost of the hedge strategy 
deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and  therefore  could reduce purchases by our customers 
in addition  volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms 
reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth  our profitability  and our cash flow from operations 
following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt  minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at september  in thousands payments due by period total within year years years after years debt  including interest payments operating leases other commitments total we have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the flu season 
we are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices 
we currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately million as of september   of which million represents our commitment in fiscal these influenza vaccine commitments are included in other commitments in the above table 
we have outsourced to ibm global services ibm a significant portion of our corporate and abdc information technology activities 
the remaining commitment under our year arrangement  as amended  which expires in june  is approximately million as of september   of which million represents our commitment in fiscal  and is included in other commitments in the above table 

table of contents our liability for uncertain tax positions was million including interest and penalties as of september  this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table 
during fiscal  our operating activities provided million of cash in comparison to cash provided of  million in the prior fiscal year 
cash provided by operations in fiscal was principally the result of income from continuing operations of million  an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income taxes of  million and non cash items of million  offset  in part  by an increase in accounts receivable of  million and an increase in merchandise inventories of  million 
accounts receivable increased from september  as the result of increased volume associated with our current express scripts and walgreens contracts 
additionally  while the payment terms in the current express scripts contract are favorable  they are less favorable than the payment terms in the previous medco contract 
as a result  there was a negative impact on our working capital in fiscal we also increased our merchandise inventories at september  to support the increased volume due to the current express scripts and walgreens contracts 
the  million increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in business volume and the timing of inventory purchases made and the related payments to our suppliers 
we use days sales outstanding  days inventory on hand  and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance 
the increase in days sales outstanding from the prior fiscal year reflects the payment terms under the current express scripts contract 
fiscal year ended september  days sales outstanding days inventory on hand days payable outstanding our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital 
the on boarding of the walgreens business in september had a negative impact on our cash flow from operating activities and on our working capital in the amount of approximately million 
however  we benefitted in fiscal from certain inventory purchases in the fourth quarter having extended payment terms relating to our walgreens contract  which will negatively impact the cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal operating cash uses during fiscal included million of interest payments and million of income tax payments  net of refunds 
during fiscal  our operating activities provided  million of cash in comparison to cash provided of  million in fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal was principally the result of income from continuing operations of million  an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income taxes of million and non cash items of million  offset  in part  by an increase in merchandise inventories of million 
non cash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of million  which represented a million decline from fiscal deferred income taxes were significantly higher in fiscal due to the larger income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories and tax bonus depreciation resulting from our business transformation capital expenditures 
the million increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases made and the related payments to our suppliers 
merchandise inventories increased million from the september  balance due to the timing of inventory purchases 
capital expenditures in fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
significant capital expenditures in fiscal included the purchase of one of our leased distribution facilities  technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our erp system  technology related costs to on board the incremental walgreens distribution volume  and expansion costs related to one of abdc facilities 
our most significant capital expenditures in fiscal and related principally to our business transformation project  which included a new erp system for our corporate office and for our abdc operations 
significant capital expenditures in fiscal also included abdc and abcs facility expansions and improvements 
other capital expenditures in fiscal and included abdc purchases of machinery and equipment  which were previously sold to financial institutions and leased back by us  and other technology initiatives 
we currently expect to spend approximately million for capital expenditures during fiscal several of the larger capital expenditures include the replacement of a distribution center  the creation of a national distribution center  the implementation of track and trace authentication technology  and information system investments to support increased order volume and future growth 
in may  we divested ab and received million of cash  net of a working capital adjustment  and divested abcc and received million of cash 
the abcc divestiture continues to be subject to a final purchase price working capital adjustment 
in april  we acquired world courier for a purchase price of million  net of a working capital adjustment 
in november  we acquired theracom for a purchase price of million  net of a working capital adjustment 
additionally  in fiscal  we finalized working capital adjustments relating to our september acquisitions of intrinsiq  llc intrinsiq and premier source premier  totaling million  net 
in september  we acquired intrinsiq for a purchase price of million  net of a working capital adjustment 
additionally  in september  we acquired premier for a purchase price of million  net of cash acquired 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities in fiscal   and  included the purchase of million   million  and million  respectively  of our common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs 
during the fiscal year ended september   we paid million to purchase capped calls to hedge the potential dilution associated with the warrants upon their exercise 
fiscal included million of proceeds received related to the november issuance of our notes and the repayments of million of senior notes due september  and million due under a terminated credit facility 
our board of directors approved the following quarterly dividend increases dividend increases per share date new rate old rate increase november may november november november we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future 
however  the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors 
market risk we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt 
we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at september   we had no variable rate debt outstanding 
the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements 
we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates 
however  there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us 
there were no such financial instruments in effect at september  we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents 
we had billion in cash and cash equivalents at september   none of which was invested in money market accounts at financial institutions 
the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable rate debt 
for every million of cash invested that is in excess of variable rate debt  a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by million 
we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non us operations 
our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar  the euro  and the uk pound sterling 
we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates 
we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure  but not for speculative or trading purposes 
as of september   we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of a c million note that we received in conjunction with the sale of abcc
