table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under item a risk factors  above 
overview molina healthcare  inc provides quality and cost effective medicaid related solutions to meet the health care needs of low income families and individuals  and to assist state agencies in their administration of the medicaid program 
we report our financial performance based on two reportable segments health plans and molina medicaid solutions 
our health plans segment comprises health plans in california  florida  michigan  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  washington  and wisconsin  and includes our direct delivery business 
as of december   these health plans served approximately million members eligible for medicaid  medicare  and other government sponsored health care programs for low income families and individuals 
the health plans are operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states  each of which is licensed as a health maintenance organization  or hmo 
our direct delivery business consists of primary care clinics in california  florida  new mexico and washington  additionally  we manage three county owned primary care clinics under a contract with fairfax county  virginia 
our health plans state medicaid contracts generally have terms of three to four years with annual adjustments to premium rates 
these contracts are renewable at the discretion of the state 
in general  either the state medicaid agency or the health plan may terminate the state contract with or without cause 
most of these contracts contain renewal options that are exercisable by the state 
our health plan subsidiaries have generally been successful in obtaining the renewal of their contracts in each state prior to the actual expiration of their contracts 
our state contracts are generally at greatest risk of loss when a state issues a new request for proposals  or rfp  subject to competitive bidding by other health plans 
if one of our health plans is not a successful responsive bidder to a state rfp  its contract may be subject to non renewal 
for instance  on february   the division of purchasing of the missouri office of administration notified us that our missouri health plan was not awarded a contract under the missouri healthnet managed care request for proposal  therefore  our missouri health plan s prior contract with the state expired without renewal on june  subject to certain transition obligations 
as of december   we continued to process claims that were incurred by the missouri health plan members through the june  termination date 
for the six months ended june   our missouri health plan contributed premium revenue of million  or of total premium revenue  and comprised  members  or of total health plans segment membership as of june  with regard to our ohio health plan  as a result of a lawsuit challenging the selection of several plans including our health plan for the new medicaid managed care program in ohio  the ohio office of medical assistance announced on october   that the operation of the program is being delayed from the previously scheduled january  start date and will now commence on july  following the trial court dismissal of the lawsuit  the court of appeals has permitted the state of ohio to move forward with implementation of the new program and finalizing the provider agreements with our ohio plan and the other selected managed care plans 
our state medicaid contracts may be periodically adjusted to include or exclude certain health benefits such as pharmacy services  behavioral health services  or long term care services  populations such as the aged  blind or disabled  or abd  and regions or service areas 
for example  our texas health plan added significant membership effective march   in service areas we had not previously served the hidalgo and el paso service areas  and among populations we had not previously served within existing service areas  such as the temporary assistance for needy families  or tanf  population in the dallas service area 
additionally  the health benefits provided to our tanf and abd members in texas under our contracts with the state were expanded to include inpatient facility and pharmacy services 
during fiscal year  we responded to several rfps and invitations to negotiate with respect to new business  including proposals to serve dual eligible populations and applications to participate in the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  capitated financial alignment demonstration project 
on august   our ohio health plan was chosen to participate in the southwest  west central  and central markets under the ohio integrated care delivery system  or icds 
the ohio icds is intended to improve care coordination for individuals enrolled in both medicaid and medicare 
the selection of our ohio health plan was made by the ohio department of jobs and family services  or odjfs  pursuant to the request for applications for qualified health plans to serve in the icds issued in april the commencement of the icds is subject to the readiness review of the selected health plans  and the execution of three way provider agreements between the health plans  odjfs  and cms 
enrollment of dual eligible members in the icds is expected to begin during the second half of 
table of contents on november   we announced that our new illinois health plan had been chosen to serve members in central illinois under the state medicare medicaid alignment initiative mmai 
the operational start date for the program is currently scheduled for october with an effective date of january in addition to the mmai  we will also serve other seniors and persons with disabilities in the medicaid program as the state expands the integrated care program that was implemented in suburban cook county and the five collar counties in may of on february   we announced that the florida agency for health care administration awarded our florida health plan contracts in three regions under the statewide medicaid managed care long term care program 
as a result of the awards  we will now enter into a comprehensive pre contracting assessment  with the program currently scheduled to commence on december  under the program  we will provide long term care benefits  including institutional and home and community based services 
on february   we announced that our new mexico health plan was selected by the new mexico human services department  or hsd  to participate in the new centennial care program 
in addition to continuing to provide physical and acute health care services  under the new program our new mexico health plan will expand its services to provide behavioral health and long term care services 
the selection of our new mexico health plan was made by hsd pursuant to its request for proposals issued in august the operational start date for the program is currently scheduled for january our molina medicaid solutions segment provides design  development  implementation  and business process outsourcing solutions to state governments for their medicaid management information systems  or mmis 
mmis is a core tool used to support the administration of state medicaid and other health care entitlement programs 
molina medicaid solutions currently holds mmis contracts with the states of idaho  louisiana  maine  new jersey  and west virginia  as well as a contract to provide drug rebate administration services for the florida medicaid program 
on october   the governor of the us virgin islands announced a partnership in which we will provide mmis to the us virgin islands through our west virginia fiscal agent operation 
the contract outlining the sharing of our platform went through several rounds of review at the federal level and has been approved by cms 
the partnership will benefit both the virgin islands and taxpayers by circumventing the costs associated with establishing an independent system while gaining leverage from operating under a common platform 
this partnership can serve as a model for the country by demonstrating that state and territorial governments can reduce local and federal costs by sharing such technologies for their medicaid populations 
on july   our molina medicaid solutions segment received full federal certification of its medicaid management information system  or mmis  in the state of idaho from cms 
as a result of the cms certification  the state of idaho is entitled to receive federal reimbursement of of its mmis operations costs retroactive to june   the date that the system first began processing claims 
our mmis in maine received full federal certification from cms on december  on june   molina medicaid solutions received notice from the state of louisiana that the state intends to award the contract for a replacement mmis to another company 
for the year ended december   our revenue under the louisiana mmis contract was million  or of total service revenue 
we expect that we will continue to perform under this contract through implementation and acceptance of the successor mmis 
based upon our past experience and our knowledge of the louisiana mmis bid process  we believe that implementation and acceptance of the successor mmis will not occur until at the earliest 
through implementation and acceptance of the successor mmis we expect to recognize approximately million in revenue annually under our louisiana mmis contract 
composition of revenue and membership health plans segment our health plans segment derives its revenue  in the form of premiums  chiefly from medicaid contracts with the states in which our health plans operate 
premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and  except as described in critical accounting policies below  is not generally subject to significant accounting estimates 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue as a fixed amount per member per month  or pmpm  pursuant to our medicaid contracts with state agencies  our medicare contracts with cms  and our contracts with other managed care organizations for which we operate as a subcontractor 
these premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services 
the state medicaid programs and the federal medicare program periodically adjust premium rates 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately of our premium revenue in the form of birth income a one time payment for the delivery of a child from the medicaid programs in all of our state health plans except new mexico 
such payments are recognized as revenue in the month the birth occurs 
the amount of the premiums paid to us may vary substantially between states and among various government programs 
pmpm premiums for the children s health insurance program  or chip  members are generally among our lowest  with rates as 
table of contents low as approximately pmpm in california 
premium revenues for medicaid members are generally higher 
among the tanf  medicaid population the medicaid group that includes mostly mothers and children pmpm premiums range between approximately in california to in ohio 
among our abd membership  pmpm premiums range from approximately in utah to  in ohio 
contributing to the variability in medicaid rates among the states is the practice of some states to exclude certain benefits from the managed care contract most often pharmacy  inpatient  behavioral health and catastrophic case benefits and retain responsibility for those benefits at the state level 
medicare membership generates the highest pmpm premiums in the aggregate  at approximately  pmpm 
the following table sets forth the approximate total number of members by state health plan as of the dates indicated as of december  total ending membership by health plan california florida michigan missouri new mexico ohio texas utah washington wisconsin total total ending membership by state for our medicare advantage plans california florida michigan new mexico ohio texas utah washington total total ending membership by state for our aged  blind or disabled population california florida michigan new mexico ohio texas utah washington wisconsin total our contract with the state of missouri expired without renewal on june molina medicaid solutions segment 
table of contents the payments received by our molina medicaid solutions segment under its state contracts are based on the performance of multiple services 
the first of these is the design  development and implementation  or ddi  of an mmis 
an additional service  following completion of ddi  is the operation of the mmis under a business process outsourcing  or bpo arrangement 
while providing bpo services which include claims payment and eligibility processing we also provide the state with other services including both hosting and support and maintenance 
because we have determined the services provided under our molina medicaid solutions contracts represent a single unit of accounting  we recognize revenue associated with such contracts on a straight line basis over the period during which bpo  hosting  and support and maintenance services are delivered 
composition of expenses health plans segment operating expenses for the health plans segment include expenses related to the provision of medical care services  general and administrative expenses  and premium tax expenses 
our results of operations are impacted by our ability to effectively manage expenses related to medical care services and to accurately estimate medical costs incurred 
expenses related to medical care services are captured in the following four categories fee for service physician providers paid on a fee for service basis are paid according to a fee schedule set by the state or by our contracts with these providers 
most hospitals are paid on a fee for service basis in a variety of ways  including per diem amounts  diagnostic related groups or drgs  percent of billed charges  and case rates 
as discussed below  we also pay a small portion of hospitals on a capitated basis 
we also have stop loss agreements with the hospitals with which we contract 
under all fee for service arrangements  we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided 
expenses related to fee for service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed 
the costs of drugs administered in a physician or hospital setting that are not billed through our pharmacy benefit manager are included in fee for service costs 
capitation many of our primary care physicians and a small portion of our specialists and hospitals are paid on a capitated basis 
under capitation contracts  we typically pay a fixed pmpm payment to the provider without regard to the frequency  extent  or nature of the medical services actually furnished 
under capitated contracts  we remain liable for the provision of certain health care services 
certain of our capitated contracts also contain incentive programs based on service delivery  quality of care  utilization management  and other criteria 
capitation payments are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates 
these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services 
the financial risk for pharmacy services for a small portion of our membership is delegated to capitated providers 
pharmacy pharmacy costs include all drug  injectibles  and immunization costs paid through our pharmacy benefit manager 
as noted above  drugs and injectibles not paid through our pharmacy benefit manager are included in fee for service costs  except in those limited instances where we capitate drug and injectible costs 
other other medical care costs include medically related administrative costs  certain provider incentive costs  reinsurance cost  and other health care expense 
medically related administrative costs include  for example  expenses relating to health education  quality assurance  case management  disease management  and hour on call nurses 
salary and benefit costs are a substantial portion of these expenses 
for the years ended december    and  medically related administrative costs were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
see critical accounting policies below for a comprehensive discussion of how we estimate such liabilities 
molina medicaid solutions segment cost of service revenue consists primarily of the costs incurred to provide business process outsourcing and technology outsourcing services under our mmis contracts 
general and administrative costs consist primarily of indirect administrative costs and business development costs 
in some circumstances we may defer recognition of incremental direct costs such as direct labor  hardware  and software associated with a contract if revenue recognition is also deferred 
such deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining original contract term  consistent with the revenue recognition period 
financial performance summary 
table of contents the following table and narrative briefly summarizes our financial and operating performance for the years ended december    and all ratios  with the exception of the medical care ratio and the premium tax ratio  are shown as a percentage of total revenue 
the medical care ratio and the premium tax ratio are computed as a percentage of premium revenue  net of premium tax  because there are direct relationships between premium revenue earned  and the cost of health care and premium taxes 
we have changed our method of calculating the medical care ratio effective december  we now calculate the medical care ratio by dividing total medical care costs by premium revenue  net of premium taxes 
previously  we did not adjust premium revenue to remove the impact of premium taxes when calculating the medical care ratio 
we made this change for all periods presented to allow better comparability of the medical care ratio between periods for health plans operating in states where premium taxes are either increased or decreased 
two states where we operate health plans michigan and california either reduced or eliminated their premium tax during year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands  except per share data earnings per diluted share premium revenue service revenue operating income net income total ending membership premium revenue service revenue investment income rental income total revenue medical care ratio general and administrative expense ratio premium tax ratio operating income net income effective tax rate medical care ratio represents medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue  net of premium taxes  premium tax ratio represents premium taxes as a percentage of premium revenue  net of premium taxes 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda we calculate a non gaap measure  ebitda  which management uses as a supplemental metric in evaluating our financial performance  in evaluating financing and business development decisions  and in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
for these reasons  management believes that ebitda is a useful supplemental measure to investors in evaluating our performance and the performance of other companies in our industry 
the reconciliation of this non gaap to gaap financial measure is as follows gaap stands for us generally accepted accounting principles 
table of contents year ended december  in thousands net income add back depreciation and amortization reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows interest expense provision for income taxes ebitda ebitda is not prepared in conformity with gaap because it excludes depreciation and amortization  as well as interest expense  and the provision for income taxes 
this non gaap financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the gaap measures of net income  operating income  operating margin  or cash provided by operating activities  nor should ebitda be considered in isolation from these gaap measures of operating performance 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  fiscal year overview and highlights earnings decreased in compared with because lower margins in the health plans segment more than offset higher premium revenue 
net income for the year ended december   was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  results for the quarter and year ended december   were affected by an impairment charge of million related to our missouri health plan 
lower net income in was in large part tied to growth in our abd membership in california and texas  where margins were considerably lower than our margins in the aggregate 
during  both california and texas transitioned large numbers of abd members from fee for service reimbursement to managed care contracts 
it has been our experience that members transitioning from fee for service reimbursement to managed care often bring with them pent up demand for medical services  and that the realization of both improved medical outcomes and costs savings from the application of managed care practices takes time as both members and providers acquaint themselves to new ways of accessing and providing care 
the initial reduction to margins associated with the transition of members from fee for service reimbursement to managed care was exacerbated by premium rates that assumed unrealistic costs savings from managed care practices 
premium rate increases received later in at least partially addressed this issue 
those rate increases  together with the improved health outcomes and the gradual reduction in medical costs resulting from the application of managed care practices  produced improved financial results in the fourth quarter of nevertheless  the aggregate impact of the abd membership transitioned in was to substantially reduce margins 
we believe  however  that in time the higher premium revenue associated with abd members will allow us to earn acceptable returns on a total dollar basis even if percentage margins remain lower than those earned by serving tanf members  for whom pmpm revenue is much lower 
health plans segment premium revenue premium revenue grew in the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a shift in member mix to populations generating higher premium revenue pmpm  benefit expansions  and an increase in membership 
medicare premium revenue was million in the year ended december   compared with million in the year ended december  growth in our abd membership led to higher premium revenue pmpm in abd membership  as a percent of total membership  has increased approximately year over year 
premium revenue pmpm also increased in the year ended december   as a result of the inclusion of revenue from the pharmacy benefit for our ohio health plan effective october   and as a result of the inclusion of revenue for the inpatient facility and pharmacy benefits across all of our texas health plan membership effective march  medical care costs the following table provides the details of consolidated medical care costs for the periods indicated dollars in thousands except pmpm amounts 
table of contents year ended december  amount pmpm of total amount pmpm of total fee for service capitation pharmacy other total medical care costs increased in primarily due to the same shifts in member mix and the benefit expansions that led to increased premium revenue  particularly in california and texas 
medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue  net of premium taxes the medical care ratio also increased in when compared with because increases in premium rates have not kept pace with increases in medical costs 
individual health plan analysis membership and premium revenue increased significantly at the texas health plan in as a result of the transition of large numbers of abd  tanf and chip members from fee for service reimbursement into managed care effective march  also on that date inpatient facility and pharmacy benefits that had previously been reimbursed through fee for service for managed care members were transitioned into managed care contracts  further increasing premium revenue and related medical costs 
as noted above  margins on newly transitioned abd members were considerably less than those experienced by the company overall 
the medical care ratio for the texas health plan abd membership in total was approximately for all of nevertheless  the medical care ratio for the texas health plan overall decreased to for all of compared with for the medical care ratio at the california health plan increased significantly in  to in from in as noted above  margins on newly transitioned abd members were considerably less than those experienced by the company overall 
the medical care ratio of the florida health plan decreased to in  from in due to a premium rate increase effective september   the re contracting of portions of the health plan specialty care network  lower inpatient utilization and lower pharmacy costs 
the medical care ratio of the michigan health plan increased to in  from in the primary reason for the increase in the medical care ratio in was a reduction to premium rates linked to a decrease in premium taxes effective april  the result was a higher medical care ratio in because premium revenue decreased 
there was no impact on profitability because premium tax expense was reduced by the same amount as premium revenue 
the remainder of the deterioration in the michigan plan medical care ratio was the result of higher pharmacy and fee for service costs 
we received a blended rate increase in michigan of approximately  effective october  the medical care ratio of the new mexico health plan increased to in  from in  primarily as a result of lower premiums and higher inpatient facility costs 
the new mexico health plan received a premium rate reduction of approximately effective july the medical care ratio of the ohio health plan increased to in  from in the increase in the ohio health plan medical care ratio was partially the result of a rate reduction effective january   together with the assumption of the lower margin pharmacy benefit effective october  the medical care ratio of the utah health plan increased to in from in the utah health plan received a premium rate reduction of approximately effective july  the addition of abd members to the washington health plan effective july  increased its medical care ratio to in the  compared with in the higher premium revenue pmpm associated with the abd membership  however  offset the increased medical care ratio so that income from operations was consistent between and the medical care ratio of the wisconsin health plan increased to in  compared with in primarily due to increases in inpatient costs 
the plan has implemented provider contracting initiatives and new utilization management techniques as a part of its efforts to improve profitability

income taxes income tax expense is recorded at an effective rate of for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the effective rate for the year ended december  is higher than our statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible expenses primarily relating to compensation and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration

liquidity and capital resources introduction we manage our cash  investments  and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility 
we forecast  analyze  and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue 
such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity 
thus  any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
we generally receive premium revenue in advance of the payment of claims for the related health care services 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents  and investments

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our health plans  which are operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states  are subject to state laws and regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state 
such state laws and regulations also restrict the timing  payment  and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder

the net assets in these subsidiaries after inter company eliminations which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans  advances  or cash dividends was million at december   and million at december  because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plans to transfer net assets to us  the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders are generally limited to cash  cash equivalents and investments held by the parent company molina healthcare  inc such cash  cash equivalents and investments amounted to million and million as of december   and  respectively

the requirements take the form of risk based capital  or rbc  rules 
michigan  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  washington  and wisconsin have adopted these rules  which may vary from state to state 
california and florida have not yet adopted naic risk based capital requirements for hmos and have not formally given notice of their intention to do so 
such requirements  if adopted by california and florida  may increase the minimum capital required for those states

actual results could differ from these estimates 
our most significant accounting policies relate to health plan contractual provisions that may limit revenue based upon the costs incurred or the profits realized under a specific contract  health plan quality incentives that allow us to recognize incremental revenue if certain quality standards are met  the recognition of revenue and costs associated with contracts held by our molina medicaid solutions segment  and  the determination of medical claims and benefits payable 
revenue recognition health plans segment premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and  except as described below  is not generally subject to significant accounting estimates 
premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services 
certain components of premium revenue are subject to accounting estimates 
the components of premium revenue subject to estimation fall into two categories contractual provisions that may limit revenue based upon the costs incurred or the profits realized under a specific contract 
these are contractual provisions that require the health plan to return premiums to the extent that certain thresholds are not met 
in some instances premiums are returned when medical costs fall below a certain percentage of gross premiums  or when administrative costs or profits exceed a certain percentage of gross premiums 
in other instances  premiums are partially determined by the acuity of care provided to members risk adjustment 
to the extent that our expenses and profits change from the amounts previously reported due to changes in estimates our revenue earned for those periods will also change 
in all of these instances our revenue is only subject to estimate due to the fact that the thresholds themselves contain elements expense or profit that are subject to estimate 
while we have adequate experience and data to make sound estimates of our expenses or profits  changes to those estimates may be necessary  which in turn will lead to changes in our estimates of revenue 
in general  a change in estimate relating to expense or profit would offset any related change in estimate to premium  resulting in no or small impact to net income 
the following contractual provisions fall into this category california health plan medical cost floors minimums a portion of certain premiums received by our california health plan may be returned to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs 
we

florida health plan medical cost floor minimum for behavioral health a portion of premiums received by our florida health plan may be returned to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined behavioral health care costs

new mexico health plan medical cost floors minimums and administrative cost and profit ceilings maximums our contract with the state of new mexico directs that a portion of premiums received may be returned to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs  or if administrative costs or profit as defined exceed certain amounts

texas health plan profit sharing under our contract with the state of texas  there is a profit sharing agreement under which we pay a rebate to the state of texas if our texas health plan generates pretax income  as defined in the contract  above a certain specified percentage  as determined in accordance with a tiered rebate schedule 
we are limited in the amount of administrative costs that we may deduct in calculating the rebate  if any 
as a result of profits in excess of the amount we are allowed to fully retain  we accrued an aggregate liability of approximately million and million pursuant to our profit sharing agreement with the state of texas at december  and december   respectively 
washington health plan medical cost floors minimums a portion of certain premiums received by our washington health plan may be returned to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs 
at both december   and december   we had not recorded any liability under the terms of this contract provision because medical expenses are not less than the contractual floor 
medicare revenue risk adjustment based on member encounter data that we submit to cms  our medicare premiums are subject to retroactive adjustment for both member risk scores and member pharmacy cost experience for up to two years after the original year of service 
this adjustment takes into account the acuity of each member s medical needs relative to what was anticipated when premiums were originally set for that member 
in the event that a member requires less acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may recover premium from us 
in the event that a member requires more acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may pay us additional retroactive premium 
a similar retroactive reconciliation is undertaken by cms for our medicare members pharmacy utilization 
we estimate the amount of medicare revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our knowledge of our members heath care utilization patterns and cms practices 
based on our knowledge of member health care utilization patterns and expenses we have recorded a net receivable of approximately million and million for anticipated medicare risk adjustment premiums at december   and december   respectively 
quality incentives that allow us to recognize incremental revenue if certain quality standards are met 
these are contract provisions that allow us to earn additional premium revenue in certain states if we achieve certain quality of care or administrative measures 
we estimate the amount of revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our experience and expertise in meeting the quality and administrative measures as well as our ongoing and current monitoring of our progress in meeting those measures 
the amount of the revenue that we will realize under these contractual provisions is determinable based upon that experience 
the following contractual provisions fall into this category new mexico health plan quality incentive premiums under our contract with the state of new mexico  incremental revenue of up to of our total premium is earned if certain performance measures are met

the first of these is the design  development and implementation  or ddi  of a medicaid management information system  or mmis 
an additional service  following completion of ddi  is the operation of the mmis under a business process outsourcing  or bpo arrangement 
while providing bpo services which include claims payment and eligibility processing we also provide the state with other services including both hosting and support and maintenance 
our molina medicaid solutions contracts may extend over a number of years  particularly in circumstances where we are delivering extensive and complex ddi services  such as the initial design  development and implementation of a complete mmis 
for example  the terms of our most recently implemented molina medicaid solutions contracts in idaho and maine were each seven years in total  consisting of two years allocated for the delivery of ddi services  followed by five years for the performance of bpo services 
we receive progress payments from the state during the performance of ddi services based upon the attainment of predetermined milestones 
we receive a flat monthly payment for bpo services under our idaho and maine contracts 
the terms of our other molina medicaid 
table of contents solutions contracts which primarily involve the delivery of bpo services with only minimal ddi activity consisting of system enhancements are shorter in duration than our idaho and maine contracts 
we have evaluated our molina medicaid solutions contracts to determine if such arrangements include a software element 
based on this evaluation  we have concluded that these arrangements do not include a software element 
as such  we have concluded that our molina medicaid solutions contracts are multiple element service arrangements under the scope of fasb accounting standards codification subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  and sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard that amends the guidance on the accounting for multiple element arrangements 
pursuant to the new standard  each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting which is generally based on whether the deliverable has standalone value to the customer 
in addition to standalone value  previous guidance also required objective and reliable evidence of fair value of a deliverable in order to treat the deliverable as a separate unit of accounting 
the arrangement s consideration that is fixed or determinable is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
in general  the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as the related goods or services are delivered  limited to the consideration that is not contingent 
we have adopted this guidance on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables entered into on or after january  our adoption of this guidance has not impacted the timing or pattern of our revenue recognition in or also  there would have been no change in revenue recognized relating to multiple element arrangements if we had adopted this guidance retrospectively for contracts entered into prior to january  we have concluded that the various service elements in our molina medicaid solutions contracts represent a single unit of accounting due to the fact that ddi  which is the only service performed in advance of the other services all other services are performed over an identical period  does not have standalone value because our ddi services are not sold separately by any vendor and the customer could not resell our ddi services 
further  we have no objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any of the individual elements in these contracts  and at no point in the contract will we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements in the contracts 
for contracts entered into prior to january   objective and reliable evidence of fair value would be required  in addition to ddi standalone value which we do not have  in order to treat ddi as a separate unit of accounting 
we lack objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the individual elements of our molina medicaid solutions contracts for the following reasons each contract calls for the provision of its own specific set of services 
while all contracts support the system of record for state mmis  the actual services we provide vary significantly between contracts  and the nature of the mmis installed varies significantly between our older contracts proprietary mainframe systems and our new contracts commercial off the shelf technology solutions because we have determined the services provided under our molina medicaid solutions contracts represent a single unit of accounting  and because we are unable to determine a pattern of performance of services during the contract period  we recognize all revenue both the ddi and bpo elements associated with such contracts on a straight line basis over the period during which bpo  hosting  and support and maintenance services are delivered 
as noted above  the period of performance of bpo services under our idaho and maine contracts is five years 
therefore  absent any contingencies as discussed in the following paragraph  we would recognize all revenue associated with those contracts over a period of five years 
in cases where there is no ddi element associated with our contracts  bpo revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as specified in the applicable contract or contract extension 
provisions specific to each contract may  however  lead us to modify this general principle 
in those circumstances  the right of the state to refuse acceptance of services  as well as the related obligation to compensate us  may require us to delay recognition of all or part of our revenue until that contingency the right of the state to refuse acceptance has been removed 
in those circumstances we defer recognition of any contingent revenue whether ddi  bpo services  hosting  and support and maintenance services until the contingency has been removed 
these types of contingency features are present in our maine and idaho contracts 
in those states  we deferred recognition of revenue until the contingencies were removed 
costs associated with our molina medicaid solutions contracts include software related costs and other costs 
with respect to software related costs  we apply the guidance for internal use software and capitalize external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software  and payroll and payroll related costs associated with employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the computer software project 
with respect to all other direct costs  such costs are expensed as incurred  unless corresponding revenue is being deferred 
if revenue is being deferred  direct costs relating to delivered service elements are deferred as well and are recognized on a straight line basis over the period of revenue recognition  in a manner consistent with our recognition of revenue that has been deferred 
such direct costs can include 
table of contents transaction processing costs 
employee costs incurred in performing transaction services 
vendor costs incurred in performing transaction services 
costs incurred in performing required monitoring of and reporting on contract performance 
costs incurred in maintaining and processing member and provider eligibility 
costs incurred in communicating with members and providers 
the recoverability of deferred contract costs associated with a particular contract is analyzed on a periodic basis using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the whole contract over its remaining contract term 
if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the long lived assets and deferred contract costs  the deferred contract costs are written down by the amount of the cash flow deficiency 
if a cash flow deficiency remains after reducing the balance of the deferred contract costs to zero  any remaining long lived assets are evaluated for impairment 
any such impairment recognized would equal the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
medical claims and benefits payable health plans segment the following table provides the details of our medical claims and benefits payable as of the dates indicated december  in thousands fee for service claims incurred but not paid ibnp capitation payable pharmacy other the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations in any given period 
such determination of our liability requires the application of a significant degree of judgment by our management 
as a result  the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date  as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
such medical care cost liabilities include  among other items  unpaid fee for service claims  capitation payments owed providers  unpaid pharmacy invoices  and various medically related administrative costs that have been incurred but not paid 
we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates 
the most important element in estimating our medical care costs is our estimate for fee for service claims which have been incurred but not paid by us 
these fee for service costs that have been incurred but have not been paid at the reporting date are collectively referred to as medical costs that are incurred but not paid  or ibnp 
our ibnp  as reported on our balance sheet  represents our best estimate of the total amount of claims we will ultimately pay with respect to claims that we have incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we estimate our ibnp monthly using actuarial methods based on a number of factors 
as indicated in the table above  our estimated ibnp liability represented million of our total medical claims and benefits payable of million as of december  excluding amounts that we anticipate paying on behalf of a capitated provider in ohio which we will subsequently withhold from that provider s monthly capitation payment  our ibnp liability at december   was million 
the factors we consider when estimating our ibnp include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our assessment of these factors is then translated into an estimate of our ibnp liability at the relevant measuring point through the calculation of a base estimate of ibnp  a further reserve for adverse claims development  and an estimate of the 
table of contents administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the base estimate of ibnp is derived through application of claims payment completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates 
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier  we estimate our outstanding claims liability based on actual claims paid  adjusted for estimated completion factors 
completion factors seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date  based on historical payment patterns 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding december   by the percentages indicated 
a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in estimated completion factors increase decrease in medical claims and benefits payable for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date  actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability  given the inherent delay between the patient physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment 
for these months of service  we estimate our claims liability based on trended pmpm cost estimates 
these estimates are designed to reflect recent trends in payments and expense  utilization patterns  authorized services  and other relevant factors 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated 
an increase in the pmpm costs results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in trended per member per month cost estimates increase decrease in medical claims and benefits payable the following per share amounts are based on a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of  and million diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december  assuming a hypothetical change in completion factors from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share 
assuming a hypothetical change in pmpm cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share 
the corresponding figures for a change in completion factors and pmpm cost estimates would be million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
it is important to note that any change in the estimate of either completion factors or trended pmpm costs would usually be accompanied by a change in the estimate of the other component  and that a change in one component would almost always compound rather than offset the resulting distortion to net income 
when completion factors are overestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be underestimated 
both circumstances will create an overstatement of net income 
likewise  when completion factors are underestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be overestimated  creating an understatement of net income 
in other words  errors in estimates involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will usually act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and medical care costs in the same direction 
if completion factors were overestimated by  resulting in an overstatement of 
table of contents net income by approximately million  it is likely that trended pmpm costs would be underestimated  resulting in an additional overstatement of net income 
after we have established our base ibnp reserve through the application of completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates  we then compute an additional liability  once again using actuarial techniques  to account for adverse developments in our claims payments which the base actuarial model is not intended to and does not account for 
we refer to this additional liability as the provision for adverse claims development 
the provision for adverse claims development is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnp 
it is intended to capture the potential inadequacy of our ibnp estimate as a result of our inability to adequately assess the impact of factors such as changes in the speed of claims receipt and payment  the relative magnitude or severity of claims  known outbreaks of disease such as influenza  our entry into new geographical markets  our provision of services to new populations such as the aged  blind or disabled abd  changes to state controlled fee schedules upon which a large proportion of our provider payments are based  modifications and upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices  and increasing medical costs 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states  we make an overall assessment of ibnp after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for adverse claims development 
we also include in our ibnp liability an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the development of ibnp is a continuous process that we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims payment information becomes available 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish ibnp 
on a monthly basis  we review and update our estimated ibnp and the methods used to determine that liability 
any adjustments  if appropriate  are reflected in the period known 
while we believe our current estimates are adequate  we have in the past been required to increase significantly our claims reserves for periods previously reported  and may be required to do so again in the future 
any significant increases to prior period claims reserves would materially decrease reported earnings for the period in which the adjustment is made 
in our judgment  the estimates for completion factors will likely prove to be more accurate than trended pmpm cost estimates because estimated completion factors are subject to fewer variables in their determination 
specifically  completion factors are developed over long periods of time  and are most likely to be affected by changes in claims receipt and payment experience and by provider billing practices 
trended pmpm cost estimates  while affected by the same factors  will also be influenced by health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
as discussed above  however  errors in estimates involving trended pmpm costs will almost always be accompanied by errors in estimates involving completion factors  and vice versa 
in such circumstances  errors in estimation involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and therefore medical care costs in the same direction 
assuming that our initial estimate of ibnp is accurate  we believe that amounts ultimately paid out would generally be between and less than the liability recorded at the end of the period as a result of the inclusion in that liability of the allowance for adverse claims development and the accrued cost of settling those claims 
because the amount of our initial liability is merely an estimate and therefore never perfectly accurate  we will always experience variability in that estimate as new information becomes available with the passage of time 
therefore  there can be no assurance that amounts ultimately paid out will not be higher or lower than this to range 
for example  for the years ended december  and  the amounts ultimately paid out were less than the amount of the reserves we had established as of december  and  by and  respectively 
furthermore  because the initial estimate of ibnp is derived from many factors  some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative  we are seldom able to assign specific values to the reasons for a change in estimate we only know when the circumstances for any one or more of those factors are out of the ordinary 
as shown in greater detail in the table below  the amounts ultimately paid out on our liabilities in fiscal years   and were less than what we had expected when we established our reserves 
while many related factors working in conjunction with one another determine the accuracy of our estimates  we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate 
in addition  given the variability inherent in the reserving process  we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations 
as a result  we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimate 
we recognized a benefit from prior period claims development in the amount of million for the year ended december  this amount represents our estimate as of december   of the extent to which our initial estimate of medical claims and benefits payable at december  was more than the amount that will ultimately be paid out in satisfaction of that liability 
we believe that the overestimation of our claims liability at december  was due primarily to the following factors at our washington health plan  we underestimated the amount of recoveries we would collect for certain high cost newborn claims  resulting in an overestimation of reserves at year end 

table of contents at our texas health plan  we overestimated the cost of new members in star plus the name of our abd program in texas  in the dallas region 
in early  the state of michigan was delayed in the enrollment of newborns in managed care plans  the delay was resolved by mid this caused a large number of claims with older dates of service to be paid during late  resulting in an artificial increase in the lag time for claims payment at our michigan health plan 
we adjusted reserves downward for this issue at december   but the adjustment did not capture all of the claims overestimation 
the overestimation of our liability for medical claims and benefits payable was partially offset by an underestimation of that liability at our missouri health plan  as a result of the costs associated with an unusually large number of premature infants during the fourth quarter of we recognized a benefit from prior period claims development in the amount of million for the year ended december  this amount represents our estimate as of december   of the extent to which our initial estimate of medical claims and benefits payable at december  was more than the amount that will ultimately be paid out in satisfaction of that liability 
we believe that the overestimation of our claims liability at december  was due primarily to the following factors at our ohio health plan  we overestimated the impact of a buildup in claims inventory 
at our california health plan  we overestimated the impact of the settlement of disputed provider claims 
at our new mexico health plan  we underestimated the impact of a reduction in the outpatient facility fee schedule 
we recognized a benefit from prior period claims development in the amount of million for the year ended december  this amount represents our estimate as of december   of the extent to which our initial estimate of medical claims and benefits payable at december  was more than the amount that will ultimately be paid out in satisfaction of that liability 
we believe that the overestimation of our claims liability at december  was due primarily to the following factors at our new mexico health plan  we underestimated the degree to which cuts to the medicaid fees schedule would reduce our liability as of december  at our california health plan  we underestimated the extent to which various network restructuring  provider contracting  and medical management initiatives had reduced our medical care costs during the second half of  thereby resulting in a lower liability at december in estimating our claims liability at december   we adjusted our base calculation to take account of the numerous factors that we believe will likely change our final claims liability amount 
we believe that the most significant among those factors are our texas health plan membership nearly doubled effective march  in addition  effective march   we assumed inpatient medical liability for abd members for which we were not previously responsible 
reserves for new coverage and new regions are now based on the newly developing claims lag patterns 
while the lag patterns are now beginning to stabilize for the new membership and coverage  the true reserve liability continues to be more uncertain than usual 
data published by the centers for disease control  or cdc  indicated a significant increase in the percentage of office visits for influenza like illnesses  or ili  during december this indicated that the annual flu season was starting earlier than it had in most recent years 
this was most noticeable in the southeast region of the country  but impacted other areas as well 
our leading indicators  including inpatient authorizations and overall pharmacy utilization  did not show as great an increase as we had expected based on the severity of the cdc flu related indices 
however  we did see a significant increase in the use of prescription flu medication  especially in our texas health plan 
therefore  we increased our reserves to account for expected additional utilization due to the early onset of the flu season 
our california health plan has enrolled approximately  new abd members since september   as a result of the mandatory assignment of abd members to managed care plans effective july  these new members converted from a fee for service environment 
due to the relatively recent transition of these members to managed care  their utilization of medical services is less predictable than it is for many of our other members 
prior to july  it was the state of washington practice to disenroll certain sick newborns from the healthy options medicaid managed care program and cover them under the supplemental security income program  or ssi  instead 
when this occurred  the health plan would reimburse the premiums received for that member back to the state and the state in turn reimbursed the health plan for the cost of care  usually retroactively to the date of birth 
effective july   the health plans now retain these members and cover them under a new abd program entitled healthy options blind and disabled  or hobd 
the premium we receive from the state for the hobd members is very high to cover 
table of contents the substantial cost of care 
by december  we had enrolled approximately  members under hobd 
because the program is relatively new  there is still some uncertainty as to the level of claims to be expected from these high cost members 
the use of a consistent methodology in estimating our liability for claims and medical benefits payable minimizes the degree to which the under or overestimation of that liability at the close of one period may affect consolidated results of operations in subsequent periods 
facts and circumstances unique to the estimation process at any single date  however  may still lead to a material impact on consolidated results of operations in subsequent periods 
any absence of adverse claims development as well as the expensing through general and administrative expense of the costs to settle claims held at the start of the period will lead to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development in the period subsequent to the date of the original estimate 
in  and  the absence of adverse development of the liability for claims and medical benefits payable at the close of the previous period resulted in the recognition of substantial favorable prior period development 
in these years  however  the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations because the amount of benefit recognized in each year was roughly consistent with that recognized in the previous year 
the following table presents the components of the change in our medical claims and benefits payable for the periods presented 
the negative amounts displayed for components of medical care costs related to prior year represent the amount by which our original estimate of claims and benefits payable at the beginning of the period was more than the actual amount of the liability based on information principally the payment of claims developed since that liability was first reported

restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and us treasury securities 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to payors consisting principally of the governments of each state in which our health plans segment and our molina medicaid solutions segment operate 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk relating to contractual variable interest rates under our term loan agreement which matures on november  the outstanding principal amount under the term loan agreement bears interest at the eurodollar rate for each interest period commencing january  we manage this floating rate debt using an interest rate swap agreement that is intended to reduce our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates to our consolidated results of operations and future outflows for interest expense 
under the swap agreement  we will receive a variable rate of one month libor plus  and pay a fixed rate of

table of contents inflation we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
there can be no assurance  however  that our strategies to mitigate health care cost inflation will be successful 
competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control health care costs 
compliance costs our health plans are regulated by both state and federal government agencies 
regulation of managed care products and health care services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and rules occur frequently 
compliance with such laws and rules may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of additional systems  procedures and programs that we have not yet identified
