item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share amounts executive overview ampco pittsburgh corporation operates in two business segments the forged and cast rolls segment and the air and liquid processing segment 
the forged and cast rolls segment consists of union electric steel corporation union electric steel or ues and union electric steel uk limited ues uk 
union electric steel is one of the world s largest manufacturers of forged hardened steel rolls with principal operations in pennsylvania and indiana whereas ues uk produces cast iron and steel rolls in england 
rolls are supplied to manufacturers of steel and aluminum throughout the world 
the air and liquid processing segment includes aerofin  buffalo air handling and buffalo pumps  all divisions of air liquid systems corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation 
aerofin produces custom engineered finned tube heat exchange coils and related heat transfer products for a variety of industries including fossil fuel and nuclear power generation  automotive  industrial process and hvac 
buffalo air handling makes custom designed air handling systems for commercial  institutional and industrial building markets 
buffalo pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the defense  refrigeration and power generation industries 
the segment has operations in virginia and new york with headquarters in pennsylvania 
the segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the us and canada 
in  the forged and cast rolls group was adversely affected by stagnant demand worldwide and competitive pricing 
order backlog and profit in backlog also eroded as the year progressed 
lower production levels of our customers in europe  excess roll inventories in asia  particularly china  and the emergence of indigenous roll supply in china  south korea and india each contributed to the falloff in demand 
price discounting has been necessary to obtain business and protect market share 
for  demand for rolling mill rolls is expected to recover modestly 
roll requirements by our customers in north america are anticipated to improve slightly as a result of a stronger automotive industry and a timid but positive housing market 
new mill projects in asia will partially offset the effects of excess roll inventories and competitive pricing pressures in that region 
european sales  however  will remain generally weak as steel producers continue to rationalize capacity 
additionally  competitive pricing pressures will likely continue as most roll producers are expected to operate below capacity 
fluctuation in the strength of the euro  as compared to the us dollar and british pound  could result in diminished volumes and reduced margins for exports 
union electric steel mg roll co  ltd ues mg  the chinese joint venture company in which a subsidiary of ues holds a interest  principally manufactures and sells high quality forged hardened steel backup rolls of a size and weight not within ues s capacity 
this is a start up business which began limited production at the end of and has been adversely impacted by the global economic slowdown and reduced demand as a result of the excess roll inventories of potential steel industry customers  particularly in china  including our steel company partner which has been unable to purchase the anticipated quantity of rolls 
contractually  the partner will acquire a significant portion of ues mg capacity when inventories are depleted which is not expected for at least two years 
consequently  in  the joint venture incurred an operating loss and an operating loss is expected for losses to date and expected in are largely the result of non cash expenses 
whilst not contemplated at this time  if conditions deteriorate or other impairment indicators arise  our future earnings could be adversely affected by an impairment charge 
for the air and liquid processing segment  a strong level of orders during the first half of from most markets served provided for a steady and profitable workflow throughout the year 
orders slowed in the second half of the year due to a reduction in spending by the institutional markets and for new ships by the us navy 
as a result of the slower second half of the year  backlog at the beginning of is approximately below that of the past two years 
our ongoing focus for this segment is developing new product lines and improving related distribution networks for the sale of such 
ampco pittsburgh annual report consolidated results of operations overview the corporation net sales forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing consolidated income loss from operations forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing corporate costs consolidated backlog forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing consolidated income loss from operations for the air and liquid processing segment for includes a pre tax charge of  for estimated costs of asbestos related litigation net of estimated insurance recoveries see note to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated net sales for declined when compared to and due to a lower demand and depressed pricing for the forged and cast rolls segment while net sales for each of the divisions of the air and liquid processing segment improved 
consolidated income from operations for deteriorated when compared to and which included a pre tax charge of  for asbestos related costs 
a lower volume of shipments  weaker pricing  reduced margins and differences in product mix contributed to the shortfall 
a more detailed review by segment is included below 
the variance in corporate costs between the years is primarily attributable to lower stock based compensation costs 
gross margin  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of net sales  was   and for  and  respectively 
the ongoing decrease is attributable to price discounting necessary to remain competitive and higher raw material costs as a percentage of sales and increasing employee benefit expenses 
selling and administrative expenses totaled  of net sales   of net sales and  of net sales for  and  respectively 
the decrease in from and in from is primarily due to lower stock based compensation costs of and  respectively  and a decrease in commission expense of  and  respectively  for the forged and cast rolls group related to the reduction in sales 
the increase in depreciation expense over the years is attributable to completion of a significant capital investment program for the forged and cast rolls group in mid and subsequent acquisitions 
depreciation expense includes a partial year of depreciation when assets are placed in service and a full year of depreciation thereafter 
the credit charge for asbestos litigation in includes a pre tax credit of representing an adjustment to previously provided charges for asbestos related litigation net of estimated insurance recoveries and includes a pre tax charge of  for estimated costs of asbestos related litigation net of estimated insurance recoveries 
the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products manufactured by certain of our former subsidiary companies now operated as divisions of the air and liquid processing segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment related income for includes a dividend from our chinese cast roll joint venture of  no dividend was declared or received in or other income expense fluctuated primarily as a result of changes in foreign exchange gains and losses and charges related to operations discontinued years ago 
gains losses on foreign exchange transactions approximated  and for  and  respectively  and charges related to operations discontinued years ago equaled   and  respectively 
ampco pittsburgh annual report our statutory income tax rate equals which compares to an effective income tax rate of  and for  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate for was adversely impacted by the revaluation of net deferred income tax assets associated with a reduction in the statutory income tax rate for the uk operation and adjustments to deferred income tax assets  partially offset by benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions 
equity losses in the chinese joint venture represent union electric steel s share of the losses of ues mg see note to consolidated financial statements 
since production by the joint venture has been limited  as explained in the executive overview  operating losses have been incurred and are expected for while losses to date are largely the result of non cash expenses  if conditions deteriorate or other impairment indicators arise  future earnings may be adversely affected by an impairment charge 
as a result of the above  we earned  or per common share for   or per common share for  and  or per common share for net income for includes an after tax charge of  or per common share for estimated costs of asbestos related litigation through net of estimated insurance recoveries 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
forged and cast rolls net sales operating income backlog for  the decrease in net sales from is due to a reduction in the level of shipments and selling prices which adversely affected operating results by approximately  and  respectively 
lower freight and commission expense offset the impact to operating income 
for  the increase in net sales from is attributable to a higher level of sales from our cast roll operations 
the additional volume added approximately  of operating income 
increases in the cost of raw materials  fuels and employee related expenses of approximately  adversely affected operating income in when compared to the decrease in backlog is a reflective of weak demand resulting in shipments outpacing new orders 
additionally  profitability in backlog has deteriorated over the years 
as of december   approximately  of the backlog is expected to be released after air and liquid processing net sales operating income loss backlog although sales for the segment improved in the current year against the prior two years  operating income decreased when compared to but improved when compared to for  operating income loss includes a credit of representing an adjustment to previously provided charges for asbestos related litigation net of estimated insurance recoveries 
for  operating income loss includes a charge of  for asbestos litigation relating to claims resulting from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  operating income loss includes uninsured legal and case management and valuation costs associated with asbestos litigation of approximately  and for  and  respectively 
for aerofin  sales and operating income benefited from a higher volume of coil shipments to customers in the nuclear power generation market  such shipments having a better profit margin 
when compared to  sales and operating income improved in the current year as a result of a higher volume of shipments to the nuclear power generation and general industrial markets 
for buffalo pumps  although sales increased from additional business activity with its power generation customers  operating income was unfavorably impacted by lower margins on certain projects for us navy shipbuilders 
for buffalo air handling  in  the division received a large order for a customer in medical research 
portions of the order shipped in and thereby improving sales and operating results 
backlog for aerofin at december  continued to improve when compared to the previous two years due to additional orders for replacement coils for customers in the power generation market 
backlog for buffalo pumps was comparable at ampco pittsburgh annual report december  and  a higher level of orders for power generation customers increased its backlog at the end of backlog for buffalo air handling declined against the prior years which included a large order for a customer in medical research 
the order has completely shipped as of december  the majority of the year end backlog is scheduled to ship in liquidity and capital resources net cash flows provided by operating activities for equaled  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
while the credit for asbestos litigation recorded in improved earnings and the charge for asbestos litigation recorded in reduced earnings  they did not affect cash flows by those amounts 
instead  the asbestos liability  net of insurance recoveries  will be paid over a number of years and will generate tax benefits 
net asbestos related payments equaled   and  in  and  respectively  and are expected to approximate  in contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans approximated  in   in of which  were voluntary contributions and  in of which  were voluntary contributions 
in  moving ahead for progress in the st century map was signed into law 
map reduces funding requirements for single employer defined benefit plans 
as a result  no minimum contributions are expected for  however  voluntarily contributions may be made 
net cash flows used in investing activities were   and  in  and  respectively  the majority of which represents capital expenditures for the forged and cast rolls group 
in  ues uk was awarded a government grant of up to  toward the purchase and installation of certain machinery and equipment of which  has been received 
as of december   anticipated future capital expenditures are expected to approximate  the majority of which will be spent in additionally  money is held in escrow which serves as collateral for the outstanding foreign currency sales contracts of ues uk 
a portion of this money was returned in in connection with diminishing exposure and no further deposits have been required to date 
net cash outflows from financing activities represent primarily the payment of dividends of per common share during each of the years 
additionally  stock options were exercised each year resulting in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefits 
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to the fluctuation of the british pound against the us dollar 
as a result of the above  cash and cash equivalents increased by  in and ended the year at  of which approximately  is held by foreign operations in comparison to  and  at december  and  respectively 
repatriation of foreign funds may result in the corporation accruing and paying additional income tax  however  the majority of foreign funds is currently deemed to be permanently reinvested and no additional provision for income tax has been made 
funds on hand and funds generated from future operations are expected to be sufficient to finance our operational and capital expenditure requirements 
we also maintain short term lines of credit in excess of the cash needs of our businesses 
the total available at december  was approximately  including  in the uk and in belgium 
ampco pittsburgh annual report we had the following contractual obligations outstanding as of december  payments due by period total years other industrial revenue bond debt operating lease obligations capital expenditures pension and other postretirement benefit obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total represents principal only 
interest is not included since it is variable  interest rates averaged less than in the current year 
the industrial revenue bonds begin to mature in  however  if the bonds are unable to be remarketed they will be refinanced under a separate facility 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
represents estimated contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans 
actual required contributions are contingent on a number of variables including future investment performance of the plans assets and may differ from these estimates 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
contributions to the us defined benefit plan are based on the projected funded status of the plan including anticipated normal costs  amortization of unfunded liabilities and an expected return on plan assets 
with respect to the uk defined benefit plan  the trustees and ues uk have agreed to a recovery plan that estimates the amount of employer contributions  based on uk regulations  necessary to eliminate the funding deficit of the plan over an agreed period 
represents primarily commitments by one of our forged and cast rolls subsidiaries for the purchase of natural gas through covering approximately of anticipated needs to meet orders in backlog 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
represents uncertain tax positions 
amount included as other represents portion for which the period of cash settlement cannot be reasonably estimated 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
with respect to environmental matters  we are currently performing certain remedial actions in connection with the sale of real estate previously owned 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
however  we believe the potential liability for all environmental proceedings of approximately  accrued at december  is considered adequate based on information known to date see note to consolidated financial statements 
the nature and scope of our business brings us into regular contact with a variety of persons  businesses and government agencies in the ordinary course of business 
consequently  we and certain of our subsidiaries from time to time are named in various legal actions 
generally  we do not anticipate that our financial condition or liquidity will be materially affected by the costs of known  pending or threatened litigation 
however  claims have been asserted alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products and there can be no assurance that future claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than presently contemplated see note to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements include the operating lease  capital expenditures and purchase obligations disclosed in the contractual obligations table and the letters of credit unrelated to the industrial revenue bonds as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation while inflationary and market pressures on costs are likely to be experienced  it is anticipated that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings efforts will mitigate the effects of inflation on operating results 
the ability to pass on increases in the price of commodities to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with us potentially having to absorb some portion of such increase 
product pricing for the forged and cast rolls segment is reflective of current costs with a majority of orders subject to a variable index surcharge program which helps to protect the segment and its customers against the volatility in the cost of certain raw materials 
long term labor agreements exist at each of the key locations see note to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  commitments have been executed for natural gas usage and for certain commodities copper and aluminum to cover a portion of orders in the backlog see note to consolidated financial statements 
ampco pittsburgh annual report application of critical accounting policies we have identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments 
critical accounting policies relate to accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  assessing recoverability of long lived assets  litigation  income taxes and stock based compensation 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  input from our actuary is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality  rates of increases in compensation  employee turnover and discount rates 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
since these benefits will be paid over many years  the expected long term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period 
also  consideration is given to target and actual asset allocations  inflation and real risk free return 
we believe the expected long term rate of return of for our domestic plan and for our foreign plan to be reasonable 
actual returns on plan assets for and  respectively  approximated and for our domestic plan and and for our foreign plan 
the discount rates used in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of our plans are based on rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefits 
high quality fixed income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of years 
we believe the assumed discount rates of and as of december  for our domestic and foreign plans  respectively  to be reasonable 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on appropriate assumptions although actual outcomes could differ 
a percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately  conversely  an increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease annual pension expense and an increase in the discount rate would decrease projected and accumulated benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value  then the asset value may not be fully recoverable potentially resulting in a write down of the asset value 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset s 
accordingly  assumptions are made about pricing  volume and asset resale values 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
we believe the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for property  plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of december  litigation and loss contingency accruals are made when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
specifically  we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to their businesses 
in addition  claims have been asserted alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products manufactured by certain of our former subsidiary companies now operated as divisions of air liquid and of an inactive subsidiary in dissolution 
to assist us in determining whether an estimate could be made of the potential liability for pending and unasserted future claims for asbestos liability along with applicable insurance coverage  and the amounts of any estimates  we hired a nationally recognized asbestos liability expert and insurance consultants 
the asbestos liability expert was not requested to estimate asbestos claims against the inactive subsidiary in dissolution  which we believe are immaterial 
based on their analyses  reserves for probable and reasonably estimable costs of asbestos liabilities including defense costs and receivables for the insurance recoveries that are deemed probable have been established 
these amounts relied on assumptions which were based on currently known facts and strategy 
in  we undertook another review of our asbestos liability claims  defense costs and the likelihood for insurance recoveries 
key variables in these assumptions are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements and include the number and type of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each new claim  average ampco pittsburgh annual report annual defense costs  the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers  and the solvency risk with respect to the relevant insurance carriers 
other factors that may affect our asbestos liability and ability to recover under our insurance policies include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  reforms that may be made by state and federal courts  and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation 
actual expenses or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the calculations vary significantly from actual results 
we intend to evaluate our estimated asbestos liability and related insurance receivables as well as the underlying assumptions on a regular basis to determine whether any adjustments to the estimates are required 
due to the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and insurance  these regular reviews may result in the incurrence of future charges  however  we are currently unable to estimate such future charges 
adjustments  if any  to our estimate of our recorded asbestos liability and or insurance receivables could be material to the operating results for the periods in which the adjustments to the liability or receivable are recorded  and to our liquidity and consolidated financial position 
accounting for income taxes includes management s evaluation of the underlying accounts  permanent and temporary differences  our tax filing positions and interpretations of existing tax law 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred income tax assets to reduce them to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in doing so  assumptions are made about the future profitability of our operations and the nature of that profitability 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
if we determined we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be established resulting in a charge to net income 
likewise  if we determined we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  we would release a portion of the existing valuation allowance resulting in an increase in net income 
as of december   we have deferred income tax assets approximating  and a valuation allowance of  we do not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements related to a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return unless it is more likely than not that the tax authorities will sustain the tax position solely on the basis of the position s technical merits 
consideration is given primarily to legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law as well as their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position when assessing the sustainability of the tax position 
in the event a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not criteria  we would reverse the tax benefit by recognizing a liability and recording a charge to earnings 
conversely  if we subsequently determined that a tax position meets the more likely than not criteria  we would recognize the tax benefit by reducing the liability and recording a credit to earnings 
as of december   based on information known to date  we believe the amount of unrecognized tax benefits of for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return which may be challenged by the tax authorities is adequate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation is based on the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant 
the fair value is affected by our stock price and various assumptions including assumptions about the expected term of the options  volatility  dividends and the risk free interest rate 
if the fair value of granted stock options was re determined  on a date other than the date of grant  the resulting fair value would differ 
accordingly  the fair value of stock options granted to date is not indicative of the fair value of stock options to be granted in the future see note to consolidated financial statements 
recently implemented accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
asu was effective for us beginning in the guidance primarily changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
it does not change the application of existing accounting principles and  accordingly  did not impact our operating results  financial position or liquidity 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income  which eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income and its components as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
all non owner changes in shareholders equity are presented either in a single continuous statement along with net income or in a separate statement immediately following net income 
asu was effective for us beginning in the guidance did not change whether items are reported in net income or other comprehensive income or when items in other comprehensive income are reclassified to net income  accordingly  asu did not impact our operating results  financial position or liquidity 
we elected to present other comprehensive income and its components as a separate statement immediately following our consolidated statements of operations 
ampco pittsburgh annual report recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires entities to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
information may be reported either on the face of the income statement or in the footnotes to the financial statements 
for other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures 
the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after january  and is to be applied prospectively 
the new guidance affects disclosures only 
it does not change whether items are reported in net income or other comprehensive income or when items in other comprehensive income are reclassified to net income  accordingly  asu will not impact our operating results  financial position or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which requires expanded disclosures  including gross and net information  about financial and derivative instruments that are either offset in the balance sheet or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after january  and is to be applied retrospectively 
the new guidance affects disclosures only and will not impact our operating results  financial position or liquidity

ampco pittsburgh annual report item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we view our primary market risk exposures as relating to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures  our policy is to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated sales and receivables  primarily us sales denominated in euros and us sales denominated in us dollars and euros 
although strengthening of the us dollar could result in a lower volume of exports from the us and at reduced margins  exports of our foreign operation may increase and gross margins might improve 
additionally  strengthening of the british pound could result in a lower volume of exports from the uk and at reduced margins  however  exports for our domestic operations may increase and gross margins might improve 
a weakening of the euro  as compared to the us dollar and british pound  could result in a lower volume of exports and at reduced margins 
to reduce the effect of price changes for certain of our raw materials and energy  we enter into contracts for particular commodities copper and aluminum and purchase a portion of our energy usage in advance 
based on estimated annual purchases  a fluctuation in commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  steel scrap and ferroalloys would have impacted and by approximately  there is no guarantee that fluctuations in commodity prices will be limited to 
the ability to pass on increases in the price of commodities to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with us potentially having to absorb some portion of such increase 
however  a sales price surcharge mechanism is in place with a majority of the customers of the forged and cast rolls segment which helps to protect us against the volatility in the cost of certain raw materials
