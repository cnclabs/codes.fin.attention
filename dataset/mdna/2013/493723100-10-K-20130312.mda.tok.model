unaudited and in thousands  except per share data revenue gross profit net operating income net income per share of common stock basic per share of common stock diluted adjusted ebitda we have a million credit facility with a group of banks led by royal bank of canada that allows us to choose interest rates from one month up to six months 
we may also choose an interest rate based on rbc prime rate  which can vary  sometimes daily 
the outstanding principle balance under this facility at december  was million  consisting of million under the term note and million under the revolver 
the agreement associated with the facility has a term of five years  and includes an uncommitted accordion facility  permitting us to obtain up to an additional million  subject to certain conditions 
the borrowing availability under this facility is based on our total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  which is a relationship between funded indebtedness to ebitda each as defined in the credit agreement 
when drawing funds on this facility we have the option of choosing between a euro rate loan which is based on the british bankers association libor or a base rate loan which is based on the higher of a the federal funds rate plus of  b the prime rate  or c the eurodollar rate plus 
if we select the euro rate loan the actual applicable rate would be to basis points above the stated rate depending on where we fall on our most recent quarterly calculation of our total leverage ratio 
if we select the base rate loan the actual applicable rate would be to basis points above the stated rate depending on where we fall on our most recent quarterly calculation of our total leverage ratio 
we are able to lock in a euro rate loan for periods up to six

unaudited and in thousands net income depreciation intangible amortization stock compensation amortization interest expense tax expense benefit initial public offering and acquisition costs adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
the adjusted ebitda reconciliation tables above provide reconciliations of this non us gaap financial measure to net income loss  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures in the same manner as we do 
we prepare adjusted ebitda to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance 
we encourage you to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate 
we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons we have various non recurring transactions and expenses that directly impact our net income 
adjusted ebitda is intended to approximate the net cash provided by operations by adjusting for non recurring  non operational items  and securities analysts use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies 
our board of directors and management use adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating performance  to determine a significant portion of management s incentive compensation  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies 
although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies  adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under us gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest expense or interest income  adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes  
table of contents adjusted ebitda does not include non cash expenses related to stock compensation  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

executive level overview we provide mission critical cybersecurity  cyber superiority and geospatial intelligence solutions to us government defense  intelligence and national security agencies and commercial enterprises 
our core capabilities include solutions  services and products to support the collection  processing  analysis  and use of intelligence data and information in the domains of cyberspace and geospace 
our solutions are designed to respond to meet the critical needs for agile intelligence in the cyber age and to assist the us government in national security priorities 
see item business for a detailed description of our business 
during  we experienced growth  both organically and through acquisitions  as we continued to establish the company as a viable and competitive entity within our target market 
we acquired four companies during and expanded our footprint into the commercial technology sector 
at the end of  we have active contracts to provide services and solutions to of the us intelligence agencies and  through our acquisition of sensage  several hundred commercial enterprises 
we intend to continue our acquisition strategy as we find the right complementary companies at the right price 
organically on a pro forma basis  assuming all acquisitions were made on january   revenues grew from during  we have expanded our services platform and our products reached our right target markets 
our growth was adversely impacted by our air force services business that declined million on a pro forma basis from absent this decline  organic revenue grew 
we intend to continue on a similar organic growth trajectory in and beyond 
in  we continued to focus significant energy on the integration and synergy capture of our acquired companies  and while there is still some remaining progress to be made in that effort  our focus remains on re accelerating our organic growth rate  winning new business  and investing in internal technology research and development initiatives to position the company for continued growth in the longer term 
key elements of our strategy include leveraging our multi int platform capabilities to further our penetration into the geospatial intelligence geoint  signals intelligence sigint  and airborne 
table of contents intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance airborne isr markets with our unique  agile  approach  establishing keyw as a thought and technology leader in the realm of enterprise cyber awareness for both commercial and government entities  and continuing to look for opportunities to acquire capabilities that further enhance our overall positioning in the markets we serve 
critical accounting policies the following are the critical accounting policies that require us to make sensitive estimates and assumptions  or that regard matters where further detail will assist the reader in better understanding our business and the results of our operations 
we have additional accounting policies included in our audited financial statements contained in item of this form k 
the policies that we have included below include revenue recognition cost of revenues inventories software development costs long lived assets excluding goodwill goodwill intangibles research and development costs income taxes share based compensation revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from time and materials  firm fixed price  cost plus fixed fee  and cost plus award fee contracts 
revenues from cost reimbursable contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized based on billable rates times hours delivered plus materials and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for firm fixed price service contracts  revenue is recognized using proportional performance based on the estimated total costs of the project 
for fixed price production contracts  revenue and cost are recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered or by other methods to measure services provided 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract costs of the contract 
during the performance of contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the impact on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses on such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
examples of estimates include the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under the contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of our progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of our management processes  facts develop that require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenue 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized  we record the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known 
in certain circumstances  and based on correspondence with the end customer  management authorizes work to commence or to continue on a contract option  addition or amendment prior to the signing of formal modifications or amendments 
we recognize revenue to the extent it is probable that the formal modifications or amendments will be finalized in a timely manner and that it is probable that the revenue recognized will be collected 
revenue from software arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements  such as software licenses  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance contract types and type of service delivered  installation or training 
the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor vsoe 
if vsoe of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time as vsoe of fair value exists or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  except in those circumstances in which the residual method may be used as described below 

table of contents with the acquisition of sensage  the company software products are licensed on a perpetual basis 
in addition  the company provides maintenance under a separate maintenance agreement  typically twelve months 
maintenance includes technical support and unspecified software upgrades and enhancements if and when available 
revenue from perpetual software licenses is recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is sold with maintenance and or professional services  and the company has established vsoe of fair value for maintenance and professional services 
the company recognizes software licenses  maintenance or professional services revenue only when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery to the customer has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement 
revenue from professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
all revenue is net of intercompany adjustments 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined on a weighted average basis or market 
our inventory consists of specialty products that we manufacture on a limited quantity basis for our customers 
we manufacture at quantity levels that are projected to be sold in the six month period following production 
the company has not had any products sold below their standard pricing less applicable volume discounts 
in and  we recorded inventory reserves of  and  respectively  for certain products where the market has not developed as expected 
software development costs costs of internally developed software for resale are expensed until the technological feasibility of the software product has been established 
in accordance with the pronouncement on software development costs of the accounting standards codification asc  software development costs are capitalized and amortized over the product estimated useful life 
the company determined that it had achieved technological feasibility during the third quarter of on certain software being developed and has capitalized approximately million 
no amortization was recognized related to these capitalized software costs at december   as the software has yet to be completed and released for general availability 
long lived assets excluding goodwill the company follows the provisions of fasb asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accounting for long lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
the guidance requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the possibility of impairment exists if the sum of the long term undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the long lived asset being evaluated 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying value of long lived assets and their fair market value based on discounted cash flows of the related assets 
impairment losses are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets 
the company has not recorded any impairments since inception 
goodwill purchase price in excess of the fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded as goodwill 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill  the company tests for impairment at least annually  using a two step approach 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the test in the fourth quarter of was performed as a single unit as it was prior to the company change to two segments 
as of the measurement at october   the company operates as two reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of income and market approaches as well as the qualitative approach 
if the carrying amount of the unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the company evaluated goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal years and and found no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill 
intangibles 
table of contents intangible assets consist of the value of customer related intangibles acquired in various acquisitions 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives unless the pattern of usage of the benefits indicates an alternative method is more representative 
the useful lives of the intangibles range from one to seven years 
research and development internally funded research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in accordance with fasb asc topic research and development  such costs consist primarily of payroll  materials  subcontractor and an allocation of overhead costs related to product development 
research and development costs totaled   and  for years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enacted date 
we will establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the company initially and subsequently measures the tax liability or benefit as the largest amount that it judges to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law developments and new or emerging legislation 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
the effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax obligations or benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management 
the company policy is to record interest and penalties as an increase in the liability for uncertain tax obligations or benefits and a corresponding increase to the income tax provision 
no such adjustments were recorded as of december   december   or december  share based compensation shareholders approved the keyw holding corporation stock incentive plan in august the stock incentive plan  which takes effect on january   replaces the stock incentive plan 
the company adopted the stock incentive plan in december in conjunction with the corporate reorganization 
the company had originally adopted a stock option plan in the company applies the fair value method that requires all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of employee stock options  be expensed over their requisite service period based on their fair value at the grant date  using a prescribed option pricing model 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value share based payments 
compensation expense related to share based awards is recognized on an accelerated basis 
the expense recognized is based on the straight line amortization of each individually vesting piece of a grant 
our typical grant vests at issuance and per year over the next three years 
we expense the initial vesting at issuance  all of the first year vesting in the first twelve months  the third vesting would be expensed over twenty four months and the fourth tranche would be expensed over thirty six months 
the calculated expense is required to be based upon awards that ultimately vest and we have accordingly  reduced the expense by estimated forfeitures 
the following assumptions were used for option grants during the periods ended december   december   and december  dividend yield the company has never declared or paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future 
risk free interest rate risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the option term assumed at the date of grant 
expected volatility volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated historical volatility or is expected to fluctuate expected volatility during a period 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of existing comparable public companies for a period that approximates the estimated life of the options 
the company used comparable public companies volatility due to insufficient trading history of our own stock until the fourth quarter of at which time the company began using its own volatility 

table of contents expected term of the options this is the period of time that the options granted are expected to remain unexercised 
the company estimates the expected life of the option term based on the expected tenure of employees and historical experience 
forfeiture rate the company estimates the percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled on an annual basis before stock options become fully vested 
the company uses the forfeiture rate that is a blend of past turnover data and a projection of expected results over the following twelve month period based on projected levels of operations and headcount levels at various classification levels with the company 
results of operations our results of operations for the years ended december   and were significantly affected by the acquisitions that were completed during those years 
in each of the last three years  we have acquired three or more companies with historical revenue run rates of over million per year 
the acquisitions are included in our financial results from the date of acquisition forward 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we started operating in two segments services and integrated solutions 
accordingly  we are reporting our financial results in aggregate and by segment 
note that our historical financial statements segregated services and products and those splits  which were presented prior to segmenting operations  are identical with our new segments 
overall results in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue gross margin cost of operations intangible amortization non operating expense income revenue revenue increased by million or  in from  as a result of the acquisitions  the full year impact of acquisitions and organic growth 
the acquisitions added million of revenue and the full year impact of the acquisitions added million of revenue 
organic revenue  addressed in more detail in the segment discussion below  increased million or on a net basis including the reduction in our services segment related to the air force services  a contract reassignment of million and the absence of the integrated solutions production contract of million from absent these three items  our organic growth was million or 
we expect our organic growth rate to continue in the double digits for the combination of poole  specifically the contract poole won in march of and its related growth  the introduction of project g software revenue  and the full year impact of the sensage acquisition in addition to growth on our other programs are expected to drive our revenue in we anticipate that revenue will continue to grow in both organically and through acquisitions 
as we expect to complete an unknown number of acquisitions  we are unable to predict our revenue 
while we are unable to predict revenue in including acquisitions  we do expect our revenue to grow at least from levels without acquisitions 
due to its early stage implementation  we are unable to give a reasonable projection of revenue to be generated from project g 
revenue increased by approximately million between and as a result of the additions of jka  fasi  and fld in which contributed million  the full year impact of everest  sycamore  iit  and tagg  all acquired in  which contributed a net million more revenue in than in  our large production contract which contributed million and the overall growth of the services business  which contributed million in offset in part by a decrease in our integrated solutions of million 
our services revenue grew due to increased headcount as we continued to expand our positions within certain contracts and new contract wins 
integrated solutions revenue declined due to a combination of several large orders in that were not replaced in and the government budget environment in  that created uncertainty with many of our customers regarding available funding 
accordingly  they purchased materially less product during 
table of contents gross margin gross margins grew both in total dollars as well as a percentage of revenue from to due to the revenue expansion and the greater percentage of revenue from our integrated solutions segment which has significantly higher profit margins than our services segment 
we expect a mix of margin pressures in including downward pressure from the poole acquisition revenue growth due to an increased reliance on subcontractors 
we expect these margin pressures to be partially offset by the revenue growth in our higher margin software revenue through both project g and sensage 
as we don t yet know how quickly the market will accept project g  we are unable to give a better range for gross margins in gross margin increased both as a percentage of revenue and in total dollars from to the revenue percentage increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of fld  offset in part by lower margins within the integrated solutions segment from the large production contract 
services margins increased slightly in gross margin dollars increased as a result of the margin increases previously described  plus increased revenue both from acquisitions and internal growth 
cost of operations cost of operations increased slightly as a percentage of revenue in from due to increased marketing  bid and proposal and research and development costs 
overall  cost of operations as a percentage of revenue have decreased in other areas since our inception due to revenue growth  company structure  and economies of scale 
the growth in revenue both organically and through acquisition has significantly exceeded the growth in overhead and general and administrative costs 
we anticipate that trend to continue 
the second main factor is the design of our corporate structure 
the company  since its inception  has been built for scalability and to operate at a much larger revenue base than it is currently operating 
the organizational infrastructure  executives  and managerial staff were put in place very early in the formation of the company to create an environment that would facilitate growth 
accordingly  the costs of that infrastructure weighed more heavily as a percentage of sales in our prior years 
during we increased both our bid and proposal and research and development expense which directly impacts our corporate expense and was the main driver for increased corporate costs as a percentage of revenue and in total dollars 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  our corporate expenses  related to sales and marketing  began to increase with the acquisition of sensage 
we expect those costs to increase in as we augment the sales staff with the general release of our commercial software product 
another significant component of our operating expense is stock compensation 
all employees in the company have stock options and some have restricted stock grants 
we have seen a significant increase in the costs associated with these equity grants with costs of   and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the company utilizes an accelerated method of recognizing expense  acceptable under us gaap  which expenses equity grants more quickly than the traditional straight line expensing 
the majority of the equity compensation expense in and has been due to acquisitions 
we believe that it is important that all employees have an equity stake in our company and expect to continue issuing equity to new employees 
we expect that overall equity compensation expense should decrease as a percentage of revenue without any new acquisitions 
intangible amortization intangible amortization increased again in as a result of the full year impact of fld and the new acquisitions in we expect intangible amortization will be approximately million in  assuming no additional acquisitions  but decline in the subsequent years as the fld intangibles  among others  will be fully amortized by the end of intangible amortization for would be million without any further acquisitions 
non operating income expense the majority of the non operating expense is interest expense associated with borrowings related to our acquisitions 
interest expense totaled million in the increase in interest expense from was due to the larger amounts of debt outstanding in the non operating expense primarily consisted of interest expense related to the borrowings related to acquisitions of  the non operating income was comprised of three main components a gain recognized from the reduction of the tagg earn out  a gain from the clawback of purchase price from the leds acquisition described below  and offsetting interest expense related to the debt incurred from the tagg and iit acquisitions 
we originally recorded the estimated equity earn out expected to be paid to the tagg owners at the time of acquisition based on tagg s forecast and operating results at that time 
the earn out was based on actual revenue and gross margin for the two years ended december  during  we updated and revised our forecast of tagg s expected performance and adjusted our anticipated earn out accordingly 
by december   we determined that it was unlikely that tagg would meet the minimum 
table of contents performance threshold for achieving any earn out 
as a result  we recognized million in income from the write down of the earn out in the leds purchase agreement contained a clawback provision that allowed us to recover certain monies paid for the acquisition of leds if certain identified employees did not stay with the company for a specified amount of time 
under that agreement  the company recognized  of income from leds employee departures in during  the company incurred interest expense related to notes payable associated with the purchases of tagg and iit 
this interest was composed of the interest on the term debt and credit line with bank of america and the subordinated debt with tagg and certain shareholders of the company 
the aggregate amount of interest expense recognized from these instruments was million 
services segment results in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue gross margin intangible amortization revenue services revenue increased by approximately million in from from a combination of acquisitions  primarily the poole acquisition  and internal growth  offset in part by the decrease in our air force services business and the reassignment of a contract by the us government 
acquisitions  both the acquisitions post closing and the impact of acquisitions for a full year  contributed approximately million of additional services revenue in the revenue decrease attributable to our air force services work and the contract reassignment totaled approximately million 
our organic growth was approximately after excluding the offsets of the air force and contract reassignment 
we continue to see significant demand for our services and expect our services segment organic revenue growth rate to climb to the mid teens during we expect that this growth will be driven in large part by the new contract that poole was awarded in may services revenue increased by approximately million in from from a combination of acquisitions that added million of revenue  acquisitions that added a net million of revenue  and organic growth that added approximately million of revenue gross margin services gross margins increased in dollars and slightly decreased as a percentage of revenue during as compared to the increase in revenue drove the increased gross margin dollars 
the decreased gross margin profit percentage was due to the acquisition of poole and a resulting increased reliance on low margin subcontract revenue in the fourth quarter of we anticipate that services gross margin will exhibit a similar pattern in with gross margin contribution increasing but that we expect gross margin as a percentage of revenue will decrease to of revenue 
services gross margins increased in dollars but remained consistent as a percentage of sales from to the increase in dollars is due to the increased revenue as previously discussed 
intangible amortization services intangible amortization expense increased by million during  primarily due to the acquisition of poole and the full year impacts of the acquisitions 
absent any new service acquisitions  we expect intangible amortization to be slightly less in as the full year impact of the poole acquisition will be offset by the completed amortization of certain assets from earlier acquisitions 
integrated solutions segment results in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue gross margin intangible amortization 
table of contents revenue integrated solutions revenue increased by million or from to  primarily from the full year impact of the fld acquisition  the addition of sensage in october and the organic growth of the business 
the pro forma revenue for fld activity prior to acquisition was million 
our integrated solutions acquisitions added approximately million of revenue for the remaining million represents the organic growth of the segment  which was largely fueled by the expansion of our air services and the growth of our hard products business  offset in part by the absence of the large million production contract we delivered in we expect that growth of this segment will be driven in large part by the release and acceptance of our project g software and related revenue combined with the full year impact of sensage in integrated solutions revenue increased by approximately million between and primarily as a result of the addition of fld  accounting for million in additional revenue  a large production contract  which contributed million in additional revenue  offset by a decline in our products revenue of million 
the large production contract was the first large order for our surface mount technology lab 
we have not received any similar orders as we look towards  but we do have a sustaining amount of smaller orders within the segment 
product revenue declined in due to a combination of several large orders in that were not replaced in and the government budget environment in that created uncertainty with many of our customers regarding their available funding 
accordingly  they bought considerably less product during gross margin integrated solutions gross margins increased both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the growth in revenue combined with the high margin software revenue and a full year of operations from our air services business combined to improve gross margin 
we expect that margins will continue to improve in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue in as we increase the percentage of revenue derived from software licenses and support both from sensage and from project g 
integrated solutions gross margin increased in dollars by decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue in and the decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the initial delivery of the large production contract and a reserve taken against certain inventory items as the market did not develop as expected 
our first deliveries of any type of product result generally in lower margin than subsequent runs due to economies of scale and experience gained in the production process 
in the addition of fld offset some of the lower margins described above 
total gross margin dollars increased in due to the increased revenue partially offset by the lower margin percentage 
intangible amortization prior to  the only intangible amortization in the integrated solutions segment related to the fld acquisition 
with the addition of sensage we expect intangible amortization to grow in to million  without any new acquisitions 
this amount will drop to million in  without any new acquisitions  as the fld intangibles will be fully amortized in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we experienced several significant cash events during  including a secondary equity offering  multiple acquisitions  entering into new senior debt agreements  and stock repurchases 
cash from operations operations provided approximately million in cash during this amount primarily consisted of net income plus non cash adjustments for depreciation  amortization and stock compensation partially offset by cash used for increased working capital needs 
accounts receivable increased by million due to revenue growth and some changes in payment terms on a large contract 
as we continue to grow  our working capital needs are expected to increase accordingly  particularly with respect to accounts receivable 
our need for additional working capital will be determined by our method and volume of growth 
growing through self performed labor will require more working capital than growing using subcontractors  but we expect self performed labor will be a more profitable alternative than using subcontractors 
the main difference for cash flow is that employees are generally paid within two weeks of incurring costs  whereas subcontractors are generally paid within days of receiving an invoice 
we had a number of non cash adjustments to our net income in including intangible amortization  stock compensation expense and an increase in depreciation from the full year impact of the fld acquisition and the relocation of our headquarters facility in may intangible amortization was approximately million in and is expected to increase in due to the full year impact of our acquisitions  less any reduction in earlier year acquisition amortization 
we expect the intangible amortization  without any additional acquisitions  to be approximately million in we believe that all employees should 
table of contents have an ownership stake in the company 
accordingly  we grant all new employees  whether new hires or employees acquired via acquisition  options in the company 
our significant growth  both organically and through acquisition  has increased our stock compensation expense to million in we use an accelerated method of expensing stock options such that most of the expense is recorded during the first year of the options 
depreciation expense for was million 
the combination of these transactions and other significantly less material non cash adjustments to net income brought our net income after non cash adjustments to million for we carry an inventory balance that is normally approximately million 
the inventory balance may increase or decrease significantly in any period based on sales  orders and breadth of product lines 
we do not carry significant quantities of specific products  rather we build products based on specific orders and at production runs that enable us to gain economies of scale 
our inventory carrying balance is reflective of our incurred cost and not expected sales prices or revenue to be derived from sales 
it is our intention to continue this inventory management practice in investing and financing during  we spent approximately million in cash and equity consideration to complete four acquisitions 
this cash was ultimately supplied by our secondary equity offering or our revolving credit facility that was established in october we expect our property and equipment purchases to increase in as we expand our aircraft operations 
we have historically completed acquisitions each year 
depending on the size and timing of future acquisitions  we may use additional proceeds under our existing debt facility  as well as additional debt or possibly equity offering proceeds  to complete such acquisitions 
additionally  during  we entered into several new leases where cash was used for certain leasehold improvements of which the landlords agreed to fund under the leases 
credit facility during  we retired our existing credit facility with a trio of banks led by bank of america  and entered into a new facility with five banks led by rbc 
the prior facility was paid off with the proceeds from our secondary offering in september the new facility was entered into in october in conjunction with the poole acquisition and amended in november the facility includes a million five year term note and a million revolver 
the credit agreement associated with the facility has a term of five years  and includes an uncommitted accordion facility  permitting us to obtain up to an additional million  subject to certain conditions 
the borrowing availability under this facility is based on out total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  which is a relationship between funded indebtedness to ebitda each as defined in the credit agreement 
when drawing funds on this facility  we have the option of choosing between a euro rate loan which is based on the british banker association libor or a base rate loan which is based on the higher of a the federal funds rate plus of  b the prime rate  or c the eurodollar rate plus 
if we select the euro rate loan the actual applicable rate would be to basis points above the stated rate depending on where we fall on our most recent quarterly calculation of our total leverage ratio 
if we select the base rate loan the actual applicable rate would be to basis points above the stated rate depending on where we fall on our most recent quarterly calculation of our total leverage ratio 
we are able to lock in a euro rate loan for periods of up to six months 
we also pay a commitment fee on our undrawn revolver ranging from to basis points  depending on our total leverage ratio 
at december   we have million outstanding under the term note and million outstanding under the revolver 
outlook we expect that our cash flow from operations will be positive 
as discussed above  the manner in which we staff our contracts will impact the degree of working capital investment required to fuel our growth 
included in our net income are several significant non cash transactions that would be add backs to net income when calculating our cash flow from operations including stock compensation expense  amortization of intangibles and depreciation of fixed assets 
we expect that the dollar value of those expenses to continue to be in the million dollar range without any additional acquisitions during our overall expectation is that adjusted ebitda will be approximately of our revenue 
see discussion of adjusted ebitda in item of this form k 
we have increased the size of our available financing under the new debt facility in anticipation of acquiring new companies that are a strategic fit and enhance our corporate platform 
it is our goal to include an equity component in our acquisitions is our normal target equity component of total purchase price and the amount of equity we include in any acquisitions will impact our available cash and credit 
the pace and size of any acquisitions will determine how much  if any  of our available credit facility we utilize during the year 

table of contents we intend to invest in several potential growth areas in that may require us to expend more research and development dollars than we have historically 
while we have factored those expenses into our adjusted ebitda expectations above  these expenses may not be incurred evenly throughout the year 
additionally  the timing of the general availability of our project g software will impact research and development expense as costs incurred prior to general availability are being capitalized but will be expensed after release 
after we went public in  employees and investors began to exercise their options and warrants 
some of these exercises were done cashlessly but other exercises were done by paying cash for their shares 
we are unable to forecast what the employee and investor activity will be in with regard to these instruments 
the total potential value of these instruments  if all exercised for cash  would be approximately million 
contractual obligations and commitments total less than one year years years more than years in thousands facilities office space office equipment total operating leases debt total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial position is exposed to several risks including interest rate risk and credit risk 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments to manage currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk  equity market or commodity price risk 
currency exchange rates we conduct our business exclusively in us dollars 
in the rare instance where we purchase goods internationally  our invoices or accounts payable vouchers are denominated in us dollars 
all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars as well as substantially all of our operating expenditures and capital purchases 
because of the services we sell  we are not subjected to fluctuations when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies because  for the most part  the us government cannot go overseas to purchase similar services 
interest rates we do not maintain an investment portfolio that would expose us to interest rate risk associated with fixed income securities 
nor do we participate in any fixed rate debt instruments that would require us to hedge interest rate risks with offsetting interest rate swaps 
the interest rates on our debt are affected by changes in market interest rates 
all outstanding balances under our term loan  and any amounts that may be borrowed under our revolving facility  are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
we do not anticipate a significant change in our borrowing rates in and a hypothetical change in rates would have no material impact on our financial statements 
debt we have a million credit facility with a group of banks led by royal bank of canada that allows us to choose interest rates from one month up to six months 
we may also choose an interest rate based on rbc prime rate  which can vary  sometimes daily 
the outstanding principle balance under this facility at december  was million  consisting of million in a term note and million on a revolver 
the credit agreement associated with the facility has a term of five years  and includes an uncommitted accordion facility  permitting us to obtain up to an additional million  subject to certain conditions 
the borrowing availability under this facility is based on our total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  which is a relationship between funded indebtedness to ebitda each as defined in the credit agreement 
when drawing funds on this 
table of contents facility  we have the option of choosing between a euro rate loan which is based on the british bankers association libor or a base rate loan which is based on the higher of a the federal funds rate plus of  b the prime rate  or c the eurodollar rate plus 
if we select the euro rate loan the actual applicable rate would be to basis points above the stated rate depending on where we fall on our most recent quarterly calculation of our total leverage ratio 
if we select the base rate loan the actual applicable rate would be to basis points above the stated rate depending on where we fall on our most recent quarterly calculation of our total leverage ratio 
we are able to lock in a euro rate loan for periods of up to six months 
we also pay a commitment fee on our undrawn revolver ranging from to basis points  depending on our total leverage ratio 
equity price risk we do not currently own nor have we ever owned any marketable equity investments to include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options 
therefore  since we do not currently own investments that are subject to market price volatility our equity price risk is very low
