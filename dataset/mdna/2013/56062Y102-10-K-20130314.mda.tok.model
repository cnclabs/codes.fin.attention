results of operations net income attributable to common shareholders was  in   in  and  in earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis were in  in  and in the primary drivers that led to the increase in net income in were lower loan loss provision expense of  reduced consultant expenses of  higher mortgage banking income of  an increase in service charge income of  a reduction in fdic premiums of  and smaller losses on oreo property of  credit losses continued to decline and new impaired loans decreased in the third party consulting fees paid in were an increase in consultant expenses 
a reduction in interest rates in led to increased mortgage refinancing activity 
continued emphasis on new account growth generated additional service charge income 
fdic premiums lowered as a result of a lower rate for the company premiums 
finally  oreo losses declined as a result of a reduced amount of oreo property 
offsetting these items was a reduction in securities gains of  lower net interest income of  and a pre payment penalty of  on a fhlb advance 
as a result of favorable pricing  the company recorded gains during on the sale of securities at a higher level than the reduction in the company yield on earnings assets was not completely offset by the reduction in the company cost of funds 
the company paid off a fhlb advance early and incurred a prepayment penalty 
however  this should provide the company with future decreased annual interest expense of the primary drivers that led to the increase in net income in from were lower loan loss provision expense of  higher realized gains on securities of  increased trust and investment product fees of  a reduction in fdic premiums of  and increased interchange income of credit losses continued to decline and new impaired loans decreased in as a result of favorable pricing  the company recorded gains during on the sale of securities at a higher level than the full year effect of increasing the number of financial advisors in resulted in higher trust and investment product fees

the company continues to move the other real estate oreo property as quickly as possible and incurred additional losses in as well as write downs on some of the properties due to the significant changes in the properties value 
the company obtained up to date appraisals on several properties which resulted in additional charge downs 
non interest income as a percent of non interest expense was for compared to for 
table of contents non interest expense total non interest expense was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in consultant expenses of  during the company completed an efficiency project with the aid of a third party consulting firm 
almost all of the company departments and corresponding headcount were reviewed  as well as the entire organizational structure of the company 
as a result of the project  many of the non interest expense categories showed reductions in these included salaries and employee benefits  telecommunications  and stationary and printing costs 
other categories also showing reductions were intangibles amortization  fdic assessment  and collection expenses 
fdic premiums lowered as a result of a lower multiplier for the company premiums 
collection expenses decreased due to a reduction in new problem loans compared to offsetting these decreases were increases in occupancy  equipment  marketing  other expenses  and a prepayment penalty on a fhlb advance 
occupancy  equipment  and marketing expenses increased primarily due to opening of three de novo branches in the largest contributor to other expense was expenses related to tax credit properties 
lastly  the company paid off a fhlb advance early and incurred a prepayment penalty of  however  the pay off of this advance should lower interest expense costs by approximately on an annual basis 
total non interest expense was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to consultant expenses of  incurred in as a result of the previously described efficiency project 
as a result of the project  approximately full time equivalent positions were targeted for elimination 
the third party consulting firm also recommended various revenue enhancements which may require future payouts if certain targets are achieved 
marketing expense and collection expense increases of and were partially offset by a reduction in the company fdic assessment of the marketing expense increase was due to costs involved in generating new deposit accounts 
collection costs continue to be elevated as the company is working through its problem credits 
as a result of the fdic changing the assessment base to total assets instead of deposits  the company fdic assessment was lower in income taxes the effective tax rate was in  in  and in the increase in the company effective rate from to and from to was primarily due to an increase in taxable income in each year 
the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns

increases in loans million  investment securities million and cash surrender value of life insurance million were offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents million and other assets million 
loans  credit risk and the allowance and provision for loan losses loans remain the company largest concentration of assets and continue to represent the greatest potential risk 
the loan underwriting standards observed by the bank are viewed by management as a means of controlling problem loans and the resulting charge offs 
the company also believes credit risks may be elevated if undue concentrations of loans in specific industry segments and to out of area borrowers are incurred 
accordingly  the company board of directors regularly monitors such concentrations to determine compliance with its loan concentration policy 
the company believes it has no undue concentrations of loans 
total loans excluding those held for sale increased by  from year end the largest increase was in the company residential real estate portfolio as on balance sheet fixed rate residential real estate loans refinanced during the year  and the company elected to keep many of these loans instead of selling them to the secondary market 
the remaining increase in loan balances was primarily due to an overall increase in loan demand 
decreases in certain other loan categories were primarily due to the following factors a decrease in construction and development loans as the continued sluggish economy resulted in the company ceasing the origination of these loans  charge offs taken during  and early payoffs on some credits 
residential real estate loans continue to represent the largest portion of the total loan portfolio and were of total loans at december  compared to of total loans at the end of

as a general rule  commercial  commercial real estate  residential  and consumer loans are reclassified to non accrual status at or before becoming days past due 
interest previously recorded is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent interest payments collected on non accrual loans are thereafter applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
non performing loans were  as of december  compared to  as of december  and represented of total loans at december  versus one year ago 
the significant reduction in is a result of the company continued emphasis on reducing the amount of non performing loans

the company is working with this borrower in an attempt to minimize its losses 
in the course of resolving problem loans  the company may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans 
the company attempts to work out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure actions 
any loans that are modified are reviewed by the company to identify if a troubled debt restructuring has occurred  which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower financial difficulties  the company grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status and could include reduction of the stated interest rate  other than normal market rate adjustments  extension of maturity dates  or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest 
the decision to restructure a loan  versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan  may benefit us by increasing the ultimate probability of collection 
the company reviews each relationship before it grants the concession to insure the creditor can comply with the new terms 
to date  most of the concessions have been extensions of maturity dates 
the provision for loan losses was  in   in  and  in the company provision for loan losses continued to decline in due to the stabilization of problem credits 
new non accrual loans declined over in net charge offs were  in compared to  in and  in as a percentage of average loans  net charge offs equaled   and in  and  respectively 
potential problem loans are identified on the company watch list and consist of loans that require close monitoring by management and are not necessarily considered classified credits by regulators 
credits may be considered as a potential problem loan for reasons that are temporary or correctable  such as for a deficiency in loan documentation or absence of current financial statements of the borrower 
potential problem loans may also include credits where adverse circumstances are identified that may affect the borrower ability to comply with the contractual terms of the loan 
other factors which might indicate the existence of a potential problem loan include the delinquency of a scheduled loan payment  deterioration in a borrower financial condition identified in a review of periodic financial statements  a decrease in the value of the collateral securing the loan  or a change in the economic environment in which the borrower operates 
substandard commercial loans that were not classified as non accrual were  at december  and  at december   a decrease of  the company believes its substandard loans peaked in when the substandard balance was approximately  these loans which are or greater are reviewed at least quarterly by senior management 
this review includes monitoring how the borrower is performing vs their workout plan  obtaining and reviewing the borrower financial information  and monitoring collateral values 
management believes these loans were well secured and had adequate allowance allocations at december

additionally  the company evaluates its consumer and residential real estate loan pools for probable losses incurred based on historical trends  adjusted by current delinquency and non performing loan levels 

table of contents the company has both internal and external loan review personnel who annually review approximately of all loans 
external loan review personnel examine the top commercial credit relationships 
this equates to approximately all relationships above the ability to absorb loan losses promptly when problems are identified is invaluable to a banking organization 
most often  losses incurred as a result of prompt  aggressive collection actions are much lower than losses incurred after prolonged legal proceedings 
accordingly  the company observes the practice of quickly initiating stringent collection efforts in the early stages of loan delinquency 
during the latter part of  the company established a separate group to address its deteriorating credit quality 
this group consists of seven full time equivalent employees and reports directly to the chief credit officer of the company 
at the present time  this group is charged with the task of efficiently resolving non performing credits and disposing of foreclosed properties 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed at least quarterly 
the determination of the provision amount in any period is based upon management continuing review and evaluation of loan loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  classified loans including non accrual and impaired loans  current economic conditions  the amount of loans presently outstanding  and the amount and composition of loan growth 
the company allowance for loan losses was  or of total loans  at december  compared to  or of total loans  at the end of this  decrease in the allowance was due in large part to write offs in that had an allowance allocated in as well as continued monitoring of problem loans 
securities  at fair value december  available for sale us government sponsored entities state and municipal mortgage backed equity and other total securities securities offer flexibility in the company management of interest rate risk  and are the primary means by which the company provides liquidity and responds to changing maturity characteristics of assets and liabilities 
the company investment policy prohibits trading activities and does not allow investment in high risk derivative products or junk bonds 
as of december   all of the securities are classified as available for sale afs and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity

table of contents for the tax equivalent yield of the investment securities portfolio was  compared to and for and  respectively 
the average life of the company investment securities portfolio was years at december  during the investment portfolio increased slightly in size as the company earnings were invested in the portfolio as loan demand remained soft 
cash flows from security sales and normal monthly principal pay downs were reinvested at materially lower yields leading to sizable decline in portfolio yield 
the reinvestments were focused on a balanced approach between a likely long term low interest rate horizon and protection against cash flow extensions when rates do move higher 
this investment strategy will allow the portfolio to meet cash needs for future loan growth 
the company and its investment advisor monitor the securities portfolio on at least a quarterly basis for other than temporary impairment otti 
the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss 
if an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the otti shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
in  the company recorded a impairment loss on one of its equity securities 
during  the company recorded of impairment charges related to three of its equity securities 
these securities were written down to their fair values  as based on the financial condition of the companies  recovery of the fair value above cost could not be readily projected 
sources of funds the company relies primarily on customer deposits and securities sold under agreement to repurchase repurchase agreements along with shareholders equity to fund earning assets

table of contents capital resources the federal reserve board and other regulatory agencies have adopted risk based capital guidelines that assign risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items 
the company core capital tier consists of common shareholders equity adjusted for unrealized gains or losses on available for sale afs securities plus limited amounts of trust preferred securities less goodwill and intangible assets 
total capital consists of core capital  certain debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   tier capital to average assets was 
total capital to risk weighted assets was 
both ratios exceed all required ratios established for bank holding companies 
risk adjusted capital levels of the bank also exceed regulatory definitions of well capitalized institutions 
the trust preferred securities which are classified as subordinated debentures currently qualify as tier capital or core capital with respect to the company under the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
under such guidelines  capital received from the proceeds of the sale of these securities cannot constitute more than of the total tier capital of the company 
consequently  the amount of trust preferred securities in excess of the limitation constitutes tier capital  or supplementary capital  of the company 
as of december   all of the company trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital 
common shareholders equity is impacted by the company decision to categorize its securities portfolio as available for sale afs 
securities in this category are carried at fair value  and common shareholders equity is adjusted to reflect unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes 
the company declared and paid common dividends of

both in and book value per common share increased to at december  compared to at the end of the net adjustment for afs securities increased book value per share by at december  and increased book value per share by at december  depending on market conditions  the adjustment for afs securities can cause significant fluctuations in shareholders equity 
on january   the company entered into an agreement with the united states department of treasury the treasury department as part of the treasury department capital purchase program 
under this agreement  the company issued to the treasury department  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares warrant shares of the company common stock 
like stock options  the warrant issued through the capital purchase program is potentially dilutive 
the average stock price for the company for and was and per share respectively  and the warrant issued in has an exercise price of per share 
this results in no additional potentially dilutive shares during and the preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and per year thereafter 
the company may  at its option and at any time  redeem the preferred stock for the liquidation amount of  per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
while the preferred stock is outstanding  the company may only pay dividends on common stock if all accrued and unpaid dividends for the preferred stock have been paid 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the company participation in the capital purchase program 
on march   the us department of the treasury priced its secondary public offering of  shares of the company preferred stock 
the company successfully bid for the purchase of  shares of the preferred stock 
during the remainder of  the company purchased  additional shares of the preferred stock from third parties 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the sale of the preferred stock 
liquidity liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient cash levels to fund operations and to meet the requirements of borrowers  depositors and creditors 
higher levels of liquidity bear higher corresponding costs  measured in terms of lower yields on short term  more liquid earning assets and higher interest expense involved in extending liability maturities 
liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents  loans and securities maturing within one year and money market instruments 
in addition  the company holds approximately  of afs securities maturing after one year  which can be sold to meet liquidity needs 
maintaining a relatively stable funding base  which is achieved by diversifying funding sources  supports liquidity  extends the contractual maturity of liabilities  and limits reliance on volatile short term purchased funds 
short term funding needs may arise from declines in deposits or other funding sources  funding of loan commitments and requests for new loans 
the company strategy is to fund assets to the maximum extent possible with core deposits  which provide a sizable source of relatively stable low cost funds 
the company defines core deposits as all deposits except certificates of deposits greater than average core deposits funded approximately of total earning assets during and approximately in 
table of contents management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower  depositor and creditor needs in the present economic environment 
the company has not received any directives from regulatory authorities that would materially affect liquidity  capital resources or operations 
contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years more than years time deposits fhlb advances subordinated debentures operating lease commitments total off balance sheet arrangements the bank incurs off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these risks derive from commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
off balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments  although material losses are not anticipated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the company off balance sheet arrangements 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk is the exposure of the company financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
the company monitors compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
these policies require estimates and assumptions 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company future financial condition and results of operations 
in management opinion  some of these areas have a more significant impact than others on the company financial reporting 
these areas currently include accounting for the allowance for loan losses  goodwill  income taxes  and mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios  past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower ability to repay including the timing of future payments  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries of amounts previously charged off 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
the company has selected june as its date for annual impairment testing  but will test more frequently if circumstances warrant 
no goodwill impairment was identified during testing performed in or income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and the municipalities in which it operates 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
the company reviews income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets  and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted as appropriate 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  the company makes judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws and also makes estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 

table of contents mortgage servicing rights the company originally records mortgage servicing rights at fair value and amortizes them over the period of the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans 
the servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to the carrying amount 
impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics  such as interest rate  loan type and investor type 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping  to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount 
new accounting matters see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the adoption of new accounting standards in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee and boards of directors of the company and the bank 
primary market risks  which impact the company operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv
