item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form k 
discussions about the important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
an inability to retain our senior management team and other managing directors would be detrimental to the success of our business 
we rely heavily on our senior management team  our practice leaders  and other managing directors  our ability to retain them is particularly important to our future success 
given the highly specialized nature of our services  the senior management team must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage an organization consisting of a diverse group of professionals 
in addition  we rely on our senior management team and other managing directors to generate and market our business 
further  our senior management s and other managing directors personal reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining client engagements 
although we enter into non solicitation agreements with our senior management team and other managing directors  we generally do not enter into non competition agreements 
accordingly  members of our senior management team and our other managing directors are not contractually prohibited from leaving or joining one of our competitors  and some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 
if one or more members of our senior management team or our other managing directors leave and we cannot replace them with a suitable candidate quickly  we could experience difficulty in securing and successfully completing engagements and managing our business properly  which could harm our business prospects and results of operations 
our inability to hire and retain talented people in an industry where there is great competition for talent could have a serious negative effect on our prospects and results of operations 
our business involves the delivery of professional services and is highly labor intensive 
our success depends largely on our general ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled professionals 
further  we must successfully maintain the right mix of professionals with relevant experience and skill sets as we continue to grow  as we expand into new service offerings  and as the market evolves 
the loss of a significant number of our professionals  the inability to attract  hire  develop  train and retain additional skilled personnel  or failure to maintain the right mix of professionals could have a serious negative effect on us  including our ability to manage  staff and successfully complete our existing engagements and obtain new engagements 
qualified professionals are in great demand  and we face significant competition for both senior and junior professionals with the requisite credentials and experience 
our principal competition for talent comes from other consulting firms and accounting firms  as well as from organizations seeking to staff their internal professional positions 
many of these competitors may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths or geographic locations than we do 
therefore  we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled consultants we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully 
increasing competition for these revenue generating professionals may also significantly increase our labor costs  which could negatively affect our margins and results of operations 
additional hiring  departures  business acquisitions and dispositions could disrupt our operations  increase our costs or otherwise harm our business 
our business strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to grow by hiring individuals or groups of individuals and by acquiring complementary businesses 
however  we may be unable to identify  hire  acquire or successfully integrate new employees and acquired businesses without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial obstacles 
from time to time  we will evaluate the total mix of services we provide and 
table of contents we may conclude that businesses may not achieve the results we previously expected 
for example  in the second quarter of we wound down our japan operations  in the third quarter of we exited the disputes and investigations practice and utilities consulting practice  and in the fourth quarter of we disposed of our accounting advisory practice 
competition for future hiring and acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the compensation we offer to potential employees or the prices we pay for businesses we wish to acquire 
in addition  we may be unable to achieve the financial  operational and other benefits we anticipate from any hiring or acquisition  as well as any disposition  including those we have completed so far 
new acquisitions could also negatively impact existing practices and cause current employees to depart 
hiring additional employees or acquiring businesses could also involve a number of additional risks  including the diversion of management s time  attention and resources from managing and marketing our company  the failure to retain key acquired personnel or existing personnel who may view the acquisition unfavorably  the potential loss of clients of acquired businesses  the need to compensate new employees while they wait for their restrictive covenants with other institutions to expire  the potential need to raise significant amounts of capital to finance a transaction or the potential issuance of equity securities that could be dilutive to our existing stockholders  increased costs to improve  coordinate or integrate managerial  operational  financial and administrative systems  the potential assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  the usage of earn outs based on the future performance of our business acquisitions may deter the acquired company from fully integrating into our existing business  the perception of inequalities if different groups of employees are eligible for different benefits and incentives or are subject to different policies and programs  and difficulties in integrating diverse backgrounds and experiences of consultants  including if we experience a transition period for newly hired consultants that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rates or margins 
all of our prior acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  some of which involved purchase prices well in excess of tangible asset values  resulting in the creation of a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination that are determined to have indefinite useful lives  but instead review them annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
to the extent that we determine that such an asset has been impaired  we will write down its carrying value on our balance sheet and book an impairment charge in our statement of operations 
in and  we took aggregate goodwill impairment charges of million and million  respectively  relating to our financing consulting segment 
if  as a result of acquisitions or otherwise  the amount of intangible assets being amortized increases  so will our amortization charges in future periods 
also  selling practices and shutting down operations present similar challenges in a service business 
divestitures not only require management s time  but they can impair existing relationships with clients or otherwise affect client satisfaction  particularly in situations where the divestiture eliminates only part of the complement of consulting services provided to a client 
if we fail to successfully address these risks  our ability to compete may be impaired and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

table of contents changes in capital markets  legal or regulatory requirements and general economic or other factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services  in which case our revenues and profitability could decline 
a number of factors outside of our control affect demand for our services 
these include fluctuations in us and global economies in general and the strength and rate of any general economic recovery from the economic recessions experienced by the us and other countries  the us or global financial markets and the availability  costs and terms of credit  changes in laws and regulations  and other economic factors and general business conditions 
we are not able to predict the positive or negative effects that future events or changes to the us or global economy  financial markets  regulatory and business environment could have on our operations 
if we are unable to manage fluctuations in our business successfully  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
we have grown significantly since we commenced operations  increasing the number of our full time professionals from as of may  to  as of december  additionally  our considerable growth has placed demands on our management and our internal systems  procedures and controls and will continue to do so in the near future 
to successfully manage growth  we must periodically adjust and strengthen our operating  financial  accounting and other systems  procedures and controls  which could increase our costs and may adversely affect our gross profits and our ability to sustain profitability if we do not generate increased revenues to offset the costs 
as a public company  our information and control systems must enable us to prepare accurate and timely financial information and other required disclosures 
if we discover deficiencies in our existing information and control systems that impede our ability to satisfy our reporting requirements  we must successfully implement improvements to those systems in an efficient and timely manner 
although we have generated positive earnings since we became a public company  we may not sustain profitability in the future 
additionally  the nature of our services and the general economic environment makes it difficult to predict our future operating results 
to sustain profitability  we must attract  integrate  retain and motivate highly qualified professionals  achieve and maintain adequate utilization and suitable billing rates for our revenue generating professionals  expand our existing relationships with our clients and identify new clients in need of our services  successfully resell engagements and secure new engagements every year  which may prove to be difficult in light of the current adverse economic conditions  maintain and enhance our brand recognition  and adapt quickly to meet changes in our markets  our business mix  the economic environment  the credit markets  and competitive developments 
our business is becoming increasingly dependent on information technology and will require additional investments in order to grow and meet the demands of our clients 
we depend on the use of sophisticated technologies and systems 
some of our practices provide services that are increasingly dependent on the use of software applications and systems that we do not own and could become unavailable 
moreover  our technology platforms will require continuing investments by us in order to expand existing service offerings and develop complementary services 
a portion of our business  in which we utilize third party software technology  has grown over the last few years and now represents a substantial portion of 
table of contents our total revenues 
if third party software technology that is important to our business does not continue to be available to us  or does not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  we may be unable to provide certain services to clients on a cost efficient and timely basis  which may harm our financial condition and operating results 
our future success depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure while continuing to improve the performance  features and reliability of our services in response to the evolving demands of the marketplace 
we could experience system failures  service interruptions  or security breaches that could negatively impact our business 
our organization is comprised of employees who work on matters throughout the united states and overseas 
our technology platform is a virtual office from which we all operate 
we may be subject to disruption to our operating systems from technology events that are beyond our control  including the possibility of failures at third party data centers  disruptions to the internet  natural disasters  power losses and malicious attacks 
in addition  despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure and operating systems  including the internet and related systems  may be vulnerable to physical break ins  hackers  improper employee or contractor access  computer viruses  programming errors  denial of service attacks or other attacks by third parties seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information or similar physical or electronic breaches of security 
while we have taken and are taking reasonable steps to prevent and mitigate the damage of such events  including implementation of system security measures  information backup and disaster recovery processes  those steps may not be effective and there can be no assurance that any such steps can be effective against all possible risks 
we will need to continue to invest in technology in order achieve redundancies necessary to prevent service interruptions 
access to our systems as a result of a security breach  the failure of our systems  or the loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings  liability or regulatory penalties and disrupt operations  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
our reputation could be damaged and we could incur additional liabilities if we fail to protect client and employee data through our own accord or if our information systems are breached 
we rely on information technology systems to process  transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients  partners  and employees 
the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches which could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
in providing services to clients  we may manage  utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data  including personal data 
as a result  we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information  such as the us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and international laws such the european union directive on data protection 
these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number 
if any person  including any of our employees  negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data  or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data  we could be subject to significant monetary damages  regulatory enforcement actions  fines  and or criminal prosecution 
in addition  unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data  whether through systems failure  employee negligence  fraud or misappropriation  could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and their related revenue in the future 
our international expansion could result in additional risks 
we operate both domestically and internationally  including in the middle east  europe and asia 
although historically our international operations have been limited  we intend to continue to expand internationally 
such 
table of contents expansion may result in additional risks that are not present domestically and which could adversely affect our business or our results of operations  including compliance with additional us regulations and those of other nations applicable to international operations  cultural and language differences  employment laws and rules and related social and cultural factors  losses related to start up costs  lack of revenue  higher costs due to low utilization and delays in purchase decisions by prospective clients  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and foreign currencies  which are harder to predict in the current adverse global economic climate  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  potentially adverse tax consequences and limitations on our ability to utilize loses generated in our foreign operations  different regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business  different or less stable political and economic environments  greater personal security risks for employees traveling to or located in unstable locations  and civil disturbances or other catastrophic events 
further  conducting business abroad subjects us to increased regulatory compliance and oversight 
for example  in connection with our international operations  we are subject to laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials  such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 
the provisions of the uk bribery act may apply outside of the uk and due to our uk based subsidiaries  we and our employees could be subject to liability for alleged activities involving bribery even if such activities were to take place outside of the uk a failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in regulatory enforcement actions as well as substantial civil and criminal penalties assessed against us and our employees 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a pledge of certain of the equity interests in our subsidiaries and a lien on substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiary grantors 
if we default on these obligations  our lenders may foreclose on our assets  including our pledged equity interest in our subsidiaries 
on april   we entered into a security agreement with bank of america the security agreement in connection with our entry into the amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of april  and amended on august  the credit agreement 
pursuant to the security agreement and to secure our obligations under the credit agreement  we granted our lenders a first priority lien  subject to permitted liens  on substantially all of the personal property assets that we and the subsidiary grantors own 
this first priority lien is in addition to the existing pledge the equity pledge that we previously granted to our lenders of of the voting stock or other equity interests in our domestic subsidiaries and of the voting stock or other equity interests in our foreign subsidiaries 
if we default on our obligations under the credit agreement  our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness and may be able to exercise their liens on the equity interests subject to the equity pledge and on their liens on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiary grantors  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  the covenants contained in the credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities  such as the incurrence of additional indebtedness  certain investments  certain acquisitions and dispositions and the payment of dividends 

table of contents our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and obligations  expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt  and adversely affect our financial results 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings totaling million 
our indebtedness could have meaningful consequences for us  including exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings are at variable interest rates  requiring us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash from operations to service our indebtedness and thus reducing the level of cash for other purposes such as funding working capital  strategic acquisitions  capital expenditures  and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing 
our intellectual property rights in our huron consulting group name are important  and any inability to use that name could negatively impact our ability to build brand identity 
we believe that establishing  maintaining and enhancing the huron consulting group name is important to our business 
we are  however  aware of a number of other companies that use names containing huron 
there could be potential trade name or service mark infringement claims brought against us by the users of these similar names and marks and those users may have trade name or service mark rights that are senior to ours 
if another company were to successfully challenge our right to use our name  or if we were unable to prevent a competitor from using a name that is similar to our name  our ability to build brand identity could be negatively impacted 
our financial results could suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and suitable billing rates for our consultants 
our profitability depends to a large extent on the utilization and billing rates of our professionals 
utilization of our professionals is affected by a number of factors  including the number and size of client engagements  the timing of the commencement  completion and termination of engagements  which in many cases is unpredictable  our ability to transition our consultants efficiently from completed engagements to new engagements  the hiring of additional consultants because there is generally a transition period for new consultants that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate  unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate level of consultants  and conditions affecting the industries in which we practice as well as general economic conditions 
the billing rates of our consultants that we are able to charge are also affected by a number of factors  including our clients perception of our ability to add value through our services  the market demand for the services we provide  an increase in the number of clients in the government sector  introduction of new services by us or our competitors  our competition and the pricing policies of our competitors  and current economic conditions 

table of contents if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate overall utilization as well as maintain or increase the billing rates for our consultants  our financial results could materially suffer 
in addition  our consultants oftentimes perform services at the physical locations of our clients 
if there are natural disasters  disruptions to travel and transportation or problems with communications systems  our ability to perform services for  and interact with  our clients at their physical locations may be negatively impacted which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of certain factors  some of which may be outside of our control 
a key element of our strategy is to market our products and services directly to large healthcare providers  such as health systems and acute care hospitals and to increase the number of our products and services utilized by existing clients 
the sales cycle for some of our products and services is often lengthy and may involve significant commitment of client personnel 
as a consequence  the commencement date of a client engagement often cannot be accurately forecasted 
as discussed below  certain of our client contracts contain terms that result in revenue that is deferred and cannot be recognized until the occurrence of certain events 
as a result  the period of time between contract signing and recognition of associated revenue may be lengthy  and we are not able to predict with certainty the period in which revenue will be recognized 
certain of our contracts provide that some portion or all of our fees are at risk if our services do not result in the achievement of certain financial performance targets 
to the extent that any revenue is contingent upon the achievement of a performance target  we only recognize revenue upon client confirmation that the performance targets have been achieved 
if a client fails to provide such confirmation in a timely manner  our ability to recognize revenue will be delayed 
other fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations may be due to a number of other factors  some of which are not within our control  including the timing and volume of client invoices processed and payments received  which may affect the fees payable to us under certain of our engagements  client decisions regarding renewal or termination of their contracts  the amount and timing of costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses  and unforeseen legal expenses  including litigation and settlement costs 
we base our annual employee bonus expense upon our expected annual adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for that year 
if we experience lower adjusted ebitda in a quarter without a corresponding change to our full year adjusted ebitda expectation  our estimated bonus expense will not be reduced  which will have a negative impact on our quarterly results of operations for that quarter 
our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly and period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 
if our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide publicly 
we provide full year financial guidance to the public based upon our expectations regarding our financial performance 
while we believe that our annual financial guidance provides investors and analysts with insight to our view of the company s future performance  such financial guidance is based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results 
if we fail to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide  or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year  the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected 

table of contents expanding our service offerings or number of offices may not be profitable 
we may choose to develop new service offerings  open new offices or eliminate service offerings because of market opportunities or client demands 
developing new service offerings involves inherent risks  including our inability to estimate demand for the new service offerings  competition from more established market participants  a lack of market understanding  and unanticipated expenses to recruit and hire qualified consultants and to market our new service offerings 
in addition  expanding into new geographic areas and expanding current service offerings is challenging and may require integrating new employees into our culture as well as assessing the demand in the applicable market 
if we cannot manage the risks associated with new service offerings or new locations effectively  we are unlikely to be successful in these efforts  which could harm our ability to sustain profitability and our business prospects 
the health care industry is an area of significant focus for our business  and factors that adversely affect the financial condition of the health care industry could consequently affect our business 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from clients in the health care industry 
as a result  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by conditions affecting the health care industry generally and hospitals and health systems particularly 
the health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  legislative  regulatory and other influences 
existing and new federal and state laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us  could cause us or our clients to incur additional costs and could restrict our or our clients operations 
many healthcare laws are complex and their application to us  our clients  or the specific services and relationships we have with our clients are not always clear 
in addition  federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us health care system at both the federal and state level  such as the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of due to the significant implementation issues arising under these laws  it is unclear what long term effects they will have on the health care industry and in turn on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations  or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations  could create liability for us  result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business 
there are many factors that could affect the purchasing practices  operations  and  ultimately  the operating funds of health care organizations  such as reimbursement policies for health care expenses  federal and state budgetary considerations  consolidation in the health care industry  and regulation  litigation  and general economic conditions 
in particular  we could be required to make unplanned modifications of our products and services which would require additional time and investment or we could suffer reductions in demand for our products and services as a result of changes in regulations affecting the health care industry  such as changes in the way that health care organizations are paid for their services eg based on patient outcomes instead of services provided 
in addition  state tax authorities have challenged the tax exempt status of some hospitals and other healthcare facilities claiming such status on the basis that they are operating as charitable and or religious organizations 
if the tax exempt status of any of our clients is revoked or compromised by new legislation or interpretation of existing legislation  that client s financial health could be adversely affected  which could adversely impact demand for our services  our sales  revenue  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to maintain and attract new business and talented personnel depends upon our reputation  the professional reputation of our revenue generating employees and the quality of our services 
as a professional services firm  our ability to secure new engagements and retain and attract talented personnel depends heavily upon our reputation and the individual reputations of our professionals 
any factor that 
table of contents diminishes our reputation or that of our employees  including not meeting client expectations or misconduct by our employees  could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new engagements  clients and employees 
similarly  because we obtain many of our new engagements from former or current clients or from referrals by those clients or by law firms that we have worked with in the past  any client that questions the quality of our work or that of our consultants could impair our ability to secure additional new engagements and clients 
the profitability of our fixed fee engagements with clients may not meet our expectations if we underestimate the cost of these engagements 
when making proposals for fixed fee engagements  we estimate the costs and timing for completing the engagements 
these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding the efficiencies of our methodologies and consultants as we plan to deploy them on engagements 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed fee engagements  including delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable  which would have an adverse effect on our profit margin 
for the years ended december    and  fixed fee engagements represented   and  respectively  of our revenues 
revenues from our performance based engagements are difficult to predict  and the timing and extent of recovery of our costs is uncertain 
we have engagement agreements under which our fees include a significant performance based component 
performance based fees are contingent on the achievement of specific measures  such as our clients meeting cost saving or other contractually defined goals 
the achievement of these contractually defined goals is subject to acknowledgement by the client and is often impacted by factors outside of our control  such as the actions of the client or other third parties 
because performance based fees are contingent  revenues on such engagements  which are recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met  are not certain and the timing of receipt is difficult to predict and may not occur evenly throughout the year 
the percentage of our revenues derived from performance based fees for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
a greater number of performance based fee arrangements may result in increased volatility in our working capital requirements and greater variations in our quarter to quarter results  which could affect the price of our common stock 
in addition  an increase in the proportion of performance based fee arrangements may temporarily offset the positive effect on our operating results from an increase in our utilization rate until the related revenues are recognized 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from a limited number of clients  and our engagement agreements  including those related to our largest clients  can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty  which may cause our operating results to be unpredictable 
as a consulting firm  we have derived  and expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients 
our ten largest clients accounted for approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
no single client accounted for more than of our revenues in   or our clients typically retain us on an engagement by engagement basis  rather than under fixed term contracts  the volume of work performed for any particular client is likely to vary from year to year and a major client in one fiscal period may not require or decide not to use our services in any subsequent fiscal period 
moreover  a large portion of our new engagements comes from existing clients 
accordingly  the failure to obtain new large engagements or multiple engagements from existing or new clients could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenues we generate 
in addition  almost all of our engagement agreements can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in engagements related to litigation  if the litigation were to be settled  our engagement for those services would no longer be necessary and  therefore  would be terminated 
in client engagements that involve multiple engagements or stages  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us 
table of contents for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
for clients in bankruptcy  a bankruptcy court could elect not to retain our interim management consultants  terminate our retention  require us to reduce our fees for the duration of an engagement  or approve claims against fees earned by us prior to or after the bankruptcy filing 
terminations of engagements  cancellations of portions of the project plan  delays in the work schedule or reductions in fees could result from factors unrelated to our services 
when engagements are terminated or reduced  we lose the associated future revenues  and we may not be able to recover associated costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the negative impact 
in addition  our clients ability to terminate engagements with little or no notice and without penalty makes it difficult to predict our operating results in any particular fiscal period 
our engagements could result in professional liability  which could be very costly and hurt our reputation 
our engagements typically involve complex analyses and the exercise of professional judgment 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of professional liability 
from time to time  lawsuits with respect to our work are pending 
litigation alleging that we performed negligently or breached any other obligations could expose us to significant legal liabilities and  regardless of outcome  is often very costly  could distract our management  could damage our reputation and could harm our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  certain of our engagements  including interim management engagements and corporate restructurings  involve greater risks than other consulting engagements 
we are not always able to include provisions in our engagement agreements that are designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services 
while we attempt to identify and mitigate our exposure with respect to liability arising out of our consulting engagements  these efforts may be ineffective and an actual or alleged error or omission on our part or the part of our client or other third parties in one or more of our engagements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we carry professional liability insurance to cover many of these types of claims  but the policy limits and the breadth of coverage may be inadequate to cover any particular claim or all claims plus the cost of legal defense 
for example  we provide services on engagements in which the impact on a client may substantially exceed the limits of our errors and omissions insurance coverage 
if we are found to have professional liability with respect to work performed on such an engagement  we may not have sufficient insurance to cover the entire liability 
the consulting services industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the consulting services industry in which we operate includes a large number of participants and is intensely competitive 
we face competition from other business operations and financial consulting firms  general management consulting firms  the consulting practices of major accounting firms  regional and specialty consulting firms  the internal professional resources of organizations and legal services providers 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry  we expect to continue to face additional competition from new entrants into the business operations and financial consulting industries 
competition in the healthcare sector is particularly intense as many of our competitors are seeking to expand their market share in this sector 
many of our competitors have a greater national and international presence  as well as have significantly greater number of personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources 
in addition  these competitors may generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do 
some of our competitors may also have lower overhead and other costs and  therefore  may be able to more effectively compete through lower cost service offerings 
our ability to compete also depends in part on the ability of our competitors to hire  retain and motivate skilled professionals  the price at which others offer comparable services  the ability of our competitors to offer new and valuable products and services to clients  and our competitors responsiveness to their clients 
if we are unable to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors  our financial results will be adversely affected 

table of contents conflicts of interest could preclude us from accepting engagements thereby causing decreased utilization and revenues 
we provide services in connection with bankruptcy  litigation and other proceedings that usually involve sensitive client information and frequently are adversarial 
in connection with bankruptcy proceedings  we are required by law to be disinterested and may not be able to provide multiple services to a particular client 
in litigation we would generally be prohibited from performing services in the same litigation for the party adverse to our client 
in addition  our engagement agreement with a client or other business reasons may preclude us from accepting engagements from time to time with our clients competitors or adversaries 
as we adjust the size of our operations and the complement of consulting services  the number of conflict situations may continue to increase 
moreover  in many industries in which we provide services  there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances 
these consolidations and alliances reduce the number of companies that may seek our services and increase the chances that we will be unable to accept new engagements as a result of conflicts of interest 
if we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason  our consultants may become underutilized  which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in future periods
