item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview and highlights we design  develop  manufacture and sell high performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components 
we introduced our first vehicle  the tesla roadster  in early the roadster s proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our powertrain technology and  with design enhancements  forms the basis for our model s sedan  our model x crossover and other future vehicles 
we are targeting our second vehicle  the model s sedan  for a significantly broader customer base than the tesla roadster and are manufacturing model s in significantly higher volumes than those for the tesla roadster 
we commenced deliveries of model s in june and increased production to an annualized rate of  per year by the end of in february  we revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover  a vehicle based on the model s platform 
we plan to start model x production in late we sell our vehicles through our own our sales and service network 
during the year ended december   we recognized total revenues of million  an increase of over total revenues of million for the year ended december  automotive sales revenue of million increased from the year ended december   driven by commencement of model s deliveries in north america  regulatory credit sales and customer demand for our remaining tesla roadsters internationally  partially offset by lower powertrain component sales 
lower powertrain component sales resulted from the completion of the daimler ag daimler smart fortwo and a class ev programs at the end of  partially offset by powertrain systems that we began to sell to toyota for the toyota rav ev in development services revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due primarily to the completion of our development activities for the toyota rav ev program during the first quarter of in  we began work on a full electric powertrain under the mercedes benz b class ev program 
the majority of our development services revenue was from the achievement of milestones and deliveries of prototype samples to daimler under this program 
in june  we commenced deliveries of model s to customers in the united states 
our timely launch of model s represented an important milestone  transitioning us from significant activities in model s development and our preparation for vehicle manufacturing at the tesla factory  to the process of ramping up for volume production in the months that followed 
gross margin for the year ended december  was 
although we produced over  model s vehicles during the year  we still experienced significant early stage higher per unit costs inefficiencies during the production ramp from june to december as a result of lower fixed cost absorption  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the initial production ramp and higher logistics costs as our supply chain processes continued to mature 
we also had higher component prices as many vendors were supplying parts at production prices later than planned due to their own manufacturing inefficiencies 
research and development r d expenses included expenses related to our model s pre production activities  including manufacturing preparedness  process validation  prototype builds and extensive testing at both the vehicle and component levels  development of the tesla factory  development and testing of model s  including activities to homologate model s for the rest of the world and to introduce the kwh and kwh battery pack options  development  design and engineering activities related to model x  and other research and development activities 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  as the model s production in the tesla factory became fully operational in  model s related manufacturing costs  including direct parts  material and labor costs  manufacturing overhead and amortized tooling  and logistics  were no longer captured in r d expenses but instead fully reflected in cost of automotive sales 

table of contents significant construction activity took place in as we readied the tesla factory to begin production of the model s 
during the first half of the year  we completed the installation of model s manufacturing equipment  tested and qualified our manufacturing equipment  and continued to fine tune our production processes while incorporating a higher percentage of production intent components into model s vehicles 
by mid year  a significant portion of our model s manufacturing related assets were ready for their intended use and we began to depreciate these assets 
as a result of investments made in the tesla factory and related supplier tooling for model s  capital expenditures increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during the year  we further expanded our company owned retail network with the opening of several more stores and service centers  primarily in the united states 
at year end  we had stores and galleries around the world 
we also successfully launched our supercharger network in california as well as our first two superchargers on the east coast 
with the higher expenses associated with the expansion of our store network and service infrastructure as well as the growth of our business in general  we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we ended the year with million in cash and cash equivalents  and current restricted cash 
in addition to cash received from our revenue generating and reservation taking activities  we funded our operations in primarily from the proceeds of our follow on offering  fully drawing down our department of energy loan facility doe loan facility as well as careful working capital management 
in october  we completed a follow on offering of  shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of million from this transaction  net of underwriting discounts which included  shares sold to elon musk  our chief executive officer and cofounder  for an aggregate amount of million 
during the year ended december   we received million in draw downs under the doe loan facility  which completed our draw down of the million facility 
during the fourth quarter  we made the first quarterly principal payment of million to repay the loans to the doe on schedule 
additionally  we had set aside million for our second quarterly doe payment  which is due in march and is classified in current restricted cash 
in march  we entered into a fourth amendment of our doe loan facility
