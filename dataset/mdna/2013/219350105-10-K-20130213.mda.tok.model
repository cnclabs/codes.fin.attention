item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion includes the following sections overview results of operations reportable segments liquidity and capital resources environment critical accounting estimates new accounting standards forward looking statements corning incorporated form k 
back to contents overview although corning s net income decreased in when compared to  we ended the year having made good progress towards our goals despite some challenging economic conditions and changing market environments 
in  we set a record for annual sales performance  stabilized our display technologies segment primarily through moderating price declines  and continued to grow our new product portfolio 
while corning remains well positioned for the future  the economic headwinds which started in and continued into impacted the majority of our segments 
most severely impacted was our display technologies segment  due to significant year over year price declines which impacted both our wholly owned business and our display technologies equity affiliates 
these price declines were driven by excess glass supply and share shifts at several major customers beginning in the latter half of and continuing into the first quarter of the supply chain became more balanced during the remainder of  as we saw a better matching of supply and demand for glass  resulting in more moderate sequential price declines 
results in our telecommunications segment declined on higher sales in  driven by an increase in operating expenses  the impact of restructuring actions and lower sales of premium fiber products  coupled with the absence of a contingent liability reversal recorded in the third quarter of in the amount of million 
results also declined in the environmental technologies segment  due to a decrease in light duty diesel product sales and the impact of restructuring actions  offset slightly by improved manufacturing performance and lower air freight expenses 
although sales in the life sciences segment increased  largely as a result of the acquisition of the discovery labware business and a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of  segment results declined due to an increase in acquisition related operating expenses 
results increased substantially in our specialty materials segment  driven by significantly higher sales of our corning gorilla glass used in portable display devices 
for the year ended december   we generated net income of billion or per share compared to net income of billion or per share for when compared to last year  the decrease in net income was due largely to the following items lower net income in the display technologies segment due to significant price declines at both our wholly owned business and the segment s equity affiliates  the impact of restructuring charges totaling million  after tax  for costs associated with workforce reductions  asset write offs and exit costs related to corning s corporate wide restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of  a decline in equity earnings from dow corning due to a significant decrease in earnings at hemlock semiconductor group hemlock  dow corning s consolidated subsidiary that manufactures high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries  driven by price and volume declines  coupled with restructuring and impairment charges in the amount of million  after tax  related to workforce reductions and asset write offs  the absence of a tax benefit in the amount of million from amending our us federal tax return to claim foreign tax credits  recorded in the third quarter of  lower royalty income from our equity affiliate samsung corning precision materials due to the combination of lower sales and the reduction in the royalty rate which took effect in december  and an increase in our effective tax rate due to the following temporary expiration of favorable us tax provisions  the effects of which will be reversed in the first quarter of due to the retroactive application of the american taxpayer relief act enacted on january   the partial expiration of tax holidays in taiwan  and change in our mix of earnings 
the decrease in net income in was offset somewhat by higher net income in our specialty materials segment  a million translation gain as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary  and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation 
this strategy has served us well 
our key priorities for were similar to those in prior years protect our financial health and invest in the future 
during  we made the following progress on these priorities financial health our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities 
significant items in included the following our debt to capital ratio at december  was  higher than our debt to capital ratio of at december  operating cash flow for the year was billion  consistent with we ended the year with over billion of cash and short term investments 
corning s board of directors declared a increase in the company s quarterly common stock dividend 
we completed a stock repurchase program which began in the fourth quarter of during  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million 
this action reflects our belief that our share price is below our intrinsic value and our confidence in our ability to continue to generate strong cash flows in the future 
investing in our future we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating keystone components that enable high technology systems 
we remain committed to investing in research  development and engineering to drive innovation 
during  we maintained a balanced innovation strategy focused on growing our existing businesses  developing opportunities adjacent or closely related to our existing technical and manufacturing capabilities  and investing in long range opportunities in each of our market segments 
we continue to work on new products  including glass substrates for high performance displays and lcd applications  diesel filters and substrates  and the optical fiber  cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber to the premises  and next generation data centers 
in addition  we are focusing on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications  such as distributed antenna systems  fiber to the cell site and fiber to the antenna 
we have focused our research  development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our corning gorilla glass suite of products 
we will continue to focus on adjacent glass opportunities which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes  including corning willow glass  our ultra slim flexible glass substrate for use in next generation consumer electronic technologies 
our research  development and engineering expenditures increased by million in when compared to  but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
we believe our spending levels are appropriate to support our technology and innovation strategies 
capital spending decreased in compared to in  corning announced several multi year investment plans to increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments 
specifically  the projects focused on an lcd glass substrate facility in china for our display technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for specialty materials corning gorilla glass in japan 
although spending for these projects continued into  the majority of the construction costs were incurred in  resulting in a significant decrease in capital spending in those segments 
slightly offsetting the decline was an increase in capital spending in the telecommunications segment  driven by capacity expansion in our fiber business 
total capital expenditures for were billion 
in  approximately million was invested in our display technologies segment 
corning incorporated form k 
back to contents we expect our capital spending to be about billion 
approximately million will be allocated to our display technologies segment  of which approximately million will be related to spending on capital projects 
corporate outlook while corning will not be without challenges in due to the uncertainty of the global economy  we expect sales to grow in our telecommunications  life sciences  specialty materials and environmental technologies segments  and for our market share to stabilize and price declines to be moderate in our display technologies segment 
a rise in global demand for corning s optical fiber and cable  combined with growth of enterprise network solutions products and fiber to the premises sales in australia should propel the sales improvement in our telecommunications segment 
our recent acquisition of the majority of the discovery labware business of becton  dickinson and company is expected to drive the life sciences segment sales growth in we believe the overall lcd glass retail market in will increase in the mid to high single digits from billion square feet in  driven by the combination of an increase in retail sales of lcd televisions and the demand for larger television screen sizes 
net income may be negatively impacted by lower equity earnings from our equity affiliate dow corning and the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
we may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the long term strategies of our businesses 
we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation  while preserving our financial stability  will enable our continued long term success

we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 
research  development and engineering expenses for increased by million to million in when compared to  but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
corning s research  development and engineering expenses focused on our specialty materials and telecommunications segments as we strive to capitalize on growth opportunities in those segments 
restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits corning recorded restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits in  and  which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented 
additional information on restructuring and asset impairment is found in note restructuring  impairment and other charges credits  note property  net of accumulated depreciation and note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 
a description of those charges and credits follows activity in response to uncertain global economic conditions  and the potential for slower growth in many of our businesses in  corning implemented a corporate wide restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of we recorded charges of million  before tax  which included costs for workforce reductions  asset write offs and exit costs 
total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately million  with the majority of spending for employee related costs completed in annualized savings from these actions are estimated to be approximately million and will be reflected largely in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in the amount of million related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations 
in the fourth quarter of  after reassessing the large cover glass business  corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in than our expectations  demand for larger sized cover glass was declining  and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market 
based on these events  we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in the amount of million  before tax 
this impairment charge represents a write down of assets specific to the glass strengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values  and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process 
corning incorporated form k 
back to contents activity in the fourth quarter of  the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million related to certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass 
large cover glass is primarily used as a cover sheet of strengthened glass for frameless bezel less lcd displays 
the large cover glass impairment charge represents a write down of assets specific to the glass strengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment 
this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process 
activity in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in other credits as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims resulting from two events which impacted production at several of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities 
in august  an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and in october  production at our facility in taichung  taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 
asbestos litigation in  we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of million compared to an increase of million in in  we recorded a net decrease to our asbestos litigation liability of million 
the net decrease in was due primarily to a million decrease to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of  as a result of the change in terms of the proposed settlement of the pcc asbestos claims 
for the remainder of  we recorded net credit adjustments to our asbestos litigation liability of million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability 
our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be million at december   compared with an estimate of million at december  the entire obligation is classified as a non current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than months after the proposed amended pcc plan is ultimately effective  and a portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning s investment in pce currently recorded as a non current other equity method investment

equity in earnings of affiliated companies the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies in millions years ended december  samsung corning precision materials dow corning all other total equity earnings equity earnings of affiliated companies decreased in  reflecting lower earnings performance at both samsung corning precision materials and at dow corning  when compared to last year 
the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 
equity earnings from dow corning decreased substantially in when compared to beginning in the latter half of  and continuing into  dow corning began experiencing unfavorable industry conditions at its consolidated subsidiary hemlock semiconductor group hemlock  a producer of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries  driven by over capacity at all levels of the solar industry supply chain 
this over capacity led to significant declines in polycrystalline spot prices in the fourth quarter of  and prices remained depressed throughout also potentially impacting this business is a chinese ministry of commerce mofcom anti dumping and countervailing duty investigation of imports of solar grade polycrystalline solar products from the us and korea 
if the chinese authorities rule that dumping or subsidization took place  they may impose additional duties on future imports of solar grade polycrystalline silicon to china from the us due to the conditions and uncertainties described above  sales volume has declined and production levels of certain operating assets have been reduced 
as a result  dow corning determined that a polycrystalline silicon plant expansion previously delayed since the fourth quarter of would no longer be economically viable and made the decision to abandon this expansion activity in the fourth quarter of the abandonment resulted in an impairment charge of million  before tax  for corning s share of the write down in the value of these construction in progress assets 
further  the startup of another plant expansion that was expected to begin production in is being delayed until sales volumes increase to levels necessary to support operations 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  the events and circumstances described above indicated that additional assets of dow corning s polycrystalline silicon business might be impaired 
in accordance with accounting guidance for impairment of long lived assets  dow corning compared estimated undiscounted cash flows to the assets carrying value and determined that the asset group is recoverable as of december  however  it is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted cash flows could change in the near term  resulting in the need to write down those assets to fair value 
if a significant adverse duty is imposed by mofcom or there is continued pricing deterioration or other adverse market conditions that result in non performance by customers under long term contracts  dow corning s estimates of cash flows might change 
partially mitigating the adverse circumstances described above are long term contracts that dow corning established in preparation for this negative volatility 
these long term contracts contain customer pre payment requirements  as well as a provision that the customers take or pay the contracted volume of the polycrystalline silicon over the life of the contract 
corning s share of the carrying value of this asset group is approximately million  after tax 
in addition to the significant declines in polycrystalline silicon prices and the impairment charge described above  equity earnings from dow corning were also negatively impacted in by the following items corning s share of the restructuring actions taken in the silicone products segment associated with workforce reductions and the impairment of assets in the amount of million  before tax  higher operating expenses due to an increase in pension expense  severance expense and compensation accruals  price declines for silicone products  and the unfavorable impact from movements in foreign exchange rates 
corning incorporated form k 
back to contents the decrease in equity earnings from dow corning in was offset somewhat by the following items a gain in the amount of million  before tax  associated with the resolution of a contract dispute by hemlock against one of its customers relating to enforcement of long term supply agreements  an increase in volume for silicone products  and lower interest expense 
the decline in equity earnings from dow corning in when compared to was primarily due to the following items an increase in raw material costs of slightly above million  a sales shift from higher priced  higher margin silicones to lower priced  lower margin silicones  and a decrease in advanced energy manufacturing tax credits 
the decrease in equity earnings from dow corning was partially offset by a gain in the amount of million associated with the resolution of a contract dispute by hemlock against one of its customers relating to enforcement of long term supply agreements 
other income expense  net other income expense  net in corning s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions years ended december  royalty income from samsung corning precision materials foreign currency transaction and hedge gains losses  net loss on retirement of debt net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests other  net total royalty income from samsung corning precision materials decreased significantly in  when compared to  reflecting a decrease in the applicable royalty rate  coupled with a decline in sales volume at samsung corning precision materials 
in december  the applicable royalty rate was reduced for a five year period by approximately compared to the prior five years 
income before income taxes in addition to the items identified under gross margin  restructuring  impairment and other charges credits  asbestos litigation charge credit  and other income  net  movements in foreign exchange rates also had a slightly positive impact for the years presented 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions years ended december  provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items rate differences on income losses of consolidated foreign companies  partially offset by us tax on deemed repatriated earnings of which million will be reversed in the first quarter of due to the retroactive application of the american taxpayer relief act enacted on january   the impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials net of tax  and the benefit of tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions  primarily taiwan 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items rate differences on income losses of consolidated foreign companies  the impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials net of tax  the benefit of tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions  primarily taiwan  and a million tax benefit from amending our us federal return to claim foreign tax credits 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items rate differences on income losses of consolidated foreign companies  the impact of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials net of tax  the benefit of tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions  primarily taiwan  the benefit of excess foreign tax credits from repatriation of current year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  and the impact of the reversal of the deferred tax assets associated with a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our other postretirement benefits liability 
corning has valuation allowances on certain shorter lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards  as well as other foreign net operating loss carry forwards and federal and state tax credits  because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire 
us profits of approximately billion will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december  of that amount  billion of us profits will be required over the next years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards 
the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized as the underlying temporary differences reverse over an extended period 
the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at december  and was million and million  respectively 
corning incorporated form k 
back to contents we currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or not indefinitely reinvested 
as of december   taxes have not been provided on approximately billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely 
it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 
our foreign subsidiary in taiwan operates under various tax holiday arrangements 
the nature and extent of such arrangements vary  and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of  and percentage points for  and  respectively 
while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next months  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position 
refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters 
net income attributable to corning incorporated as a result of the items discussed above  net income and per share data was as follows in millions  except per share amounts years ended december  net income attributable to corning incorporated basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share shares used in computing per share amounts basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share reportable segments our reportable segments are as follows display technologies manufactures glass substrates for flat panel liquid crystal displays 
telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry 
environmental technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications 
this reportable segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics  products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods 
specialty materials manufactures products that provide more than material formulations for glass  glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs 
life sciences manufactures glass and plastic labware  equipment  media and reagents to provide workflow solutions for scientific applications 
all other reportable segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as all other 
this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines 
we prepared the financial results for our segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions 
we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment s net income 
we have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information

the decrease in net sales in  when compared to  reflects significant price declines which occurred in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  driven by customer and competitive pressures associated with share shifts at several major customers in a period of excess glass supply 
sequential price declines became much more moderate in the second and third quarters of  reflecting a better matching of supply and demand for glass  and more stable levels of inventory in the lcd supply chain 
in the third and fourth quarter of  corning entered into new agreements with key customers 
these agreements stabilize corning s share at each of the customers and maintain a fixed relationship between corning s pricing and competitive pricing at that customer 
fourth quarter sequential price declines were slightly higher than the prior two quarters  due to some initial adjustments to line up corning s prior pricing with the requirements of these new agreements 
retail demand for larger sized lcd televisions drove a double digit increase in volume in our wholly owned business in  when compared to the prior year  and slightly offset the price declines described above 
movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales of this segment 
the decrease in equity earnings from our display technologies equity affiliates in  when compared to  reflected substantial price declines  driven by the circumstances described above  relatively consistent volume and share loss at a key customer 
also negatively impacting equity earnings were restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of  consisting largely of tank and finishing line asset write offs  in the amount of million 
although equity earnings of the equity affiliates of this segment are impacted by movements in both the us dollar japanese yen and us dollar korean won exchange rates  movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact equity earnings for the year ended december  when compared to  the decrease in net income in reflects the impact of price declines described above at both our wholly owned business and the segment equity affiliates  a reduction in royalty income  and the impact of restructuring actions  partially offset by a double digit increase in volume at our wholly owned business 
restructuring costs in this segment totaled approximately million  before tax  and consisted primarily of the write off of finishing line assets located in japan and exit costs for the consolidation of office space 
movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net income of this segment 
a number of corning s patents and know how are licensed to samsung corning precision materials  as well as to third parties  which generates royalty income 
royalty income from samsung corning precision materials decreased significantly in  when compared to  reflecting a decrease in the applicable royalty rate  coupled with a decline in sales volume at samsung corning precision materials 
in december  the applicable royalty rate was reduced for a five year period by approximately compared to the prior five years

vs 
the end market for lcd televisions was up slightly in  with unit growth rates remaining consistent with or exceeding our expectations across all geographic regions 
additionally  larger sized lcd televisions were the fastest growing size category in and have resulted in area growth rates that were even higher than unit growth rates 
however  because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers  supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry are key factors in corning s sales volume 
while end market demand continues to grow in all lcd applications  inventory levels within the lcd supply chain have not kept pace with this growth  and have  in fact  declined in absolute terms during when compared to  resulting in lower volume and excess capacity in the supply chain 
as a result  corning announced in the fourth quarter of that it would reduce capacity at our wholly owned business by delaying the start up of new glass melting tanks  as well as postponing the relight of tanks that were removed from service for normal repair 
our equity affiliate  samsung corning precision materials  took similar actions in the fourth quarter of the slight increase in net sales in the display technologies segment in  compared to  was driven primarily by the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and  as a result  are susceptible to movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate 
volume growth in was more than offset by price declines  when compared to when compared to  the decrease in equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials in reflected volume and price declines  offset somewhat by the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
equity earnings of samsung corning precision materials are impacted by movements in both the us dollar japanese yen and us dollar korean won exchange rates 
the impact of the supply chain contraction and excess capacity in has been more severe in korea  resulting in higher price and volume declines at samsung corning precision materials than at our wholly owned business 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  although samsung corning precision materials significantly reduced its glass pricing in light of the current state of glass supply in the industry  it did not recover market share that was lost in the third quarter 
due to these market dynamics  samsung corning precision materials reduced its glass melting capacity  as described above 
equity earnings were also negatively impacted by higher taxes due to the partial expiration of a korean tax holiday and the absence of a million credit for our share of a revised tax holiday calculation agreed to by the korean national tax service recorded in when compared to  the decrease in net income in the display technologies segment in reflects the impact of lower equity earnings  price declines and a decrease in royalty income  partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiency and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
net income was also negatively impacted by the absence of a pre tax credit recorded in in the amount of million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims 
other information the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan  china and taiwan 
in  three customers of the display technologies segment  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for a combined of total segment sales 
for  four customers of the display technologies segment  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales 
for  three customers of the display technologies segment  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales 
our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market 
our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 
in addition  samsung corning precision materials sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers 
in  and  sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea accounted for approximately of samsung corning precision materials sales in each of those three years 
corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for lcd glass substrates 
in   and  capital spending in this segment was million  billion  and million  respectively 
we expect capital spending for to be approximately million  of which approximately million will be related to spending on capital projects 
corning incorporated form k 
back to contents outlook we expect the overall lcd glass retail market to be up mid to high single digits in  from billion square feet in we believe that the long term market drivers will be lcd television growth  driven by growth of larger sized lcd televisions and increased demand in emerging regions 
in the first quarter of  we expect volume at our wholly owned business and our segment equity affiliates to increase when compared to the first quarter of  but to be down sequentially by mid single digits 
we expect price declines in our wholly owned business in the first quarter of to be more moderate when compared to the previous quarter  and for price declines at our segment equity affiliates to be consistent with the prior quarter 
the end market demand for lcd televisions  monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending  among other things 
we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions  particularly a global economic recession  excess market capacity and world political tensions could have on consumer demand 
while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years  economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes  prices  or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth 
therefore  it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time 
we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates  principally the japanese yen  will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment

net sales for the segment were up slightly when compared to  driven by increased demand for optical fiber and cable in china  fiber to the premises products in australia  and wireless products 
this growth was offset somewhat by declines in demand for legacy copper products and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
the decrease in net income in reflects the impact of restructuring actions  lower sales of premium fiber products  an increase in research and development expenses  an increase in project spending  and the absence of a contingent liability reversal recorded in in the amount of million 
somewhat offsetting the decrease in net income was a translation gain in the amount of million for the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary recorded in the fourth quarter of and the partial reversal of a warranty reserve related to our fiber to the premises and fiber optic cable products in the pre tax amount of million  recorded in the third quarter of net income of this segment in included approximately million of restructuring charges associated with the company s corporate wide restructuring plan  which included headcount reductions  asset write offs and the write off of a small equity affiliate in japan

corning s off balance sheet arrangements include the following guarantee contracts  and variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities 
at the time a guarantee is issued  the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones

environment corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by the agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
at december  and  corning had accrued approximately million undiscounted and million undiscounted  respectively  for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation

the estimates that required us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates  follow 
impairment of assets held for use we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified 
we review our long lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals  primarily platinum and rhodium 
these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life 
precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long lived assets 
this review considers all of the company s precious metals that are either in place in the production process  in reclamation  fabrication  or refinement in anticipation of re use  or awaiting use to support increased capacity 
precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non manufacturing related purposes 
examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for the majority of our reportable segments  we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for long lived assets  when impairment indicators are present  we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows  including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value  to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable 
this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used 
assessments also consider changes in asset utilization  including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production 
if there is an impairment  a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above  the estimated fair value of long lived assets is determined using an income approach  market approach  cost approach  or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed 
all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long lived assets  and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals if appropriate for the asset group being reviewed 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth  market share  projected selling prices  manufacturing cost and discount rate 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions 
the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
corning incorporated form k 
back to contents in the event the current net book value of an asset group is found to be greater than the net present value of the cash flows derived from the asset group  we determine the actual fair market value of long lived assets with the assistance from valuation appraisals conducted by third parties 
the results of these valuations generally represent the fair market value of the asset group that will remain after any necessary impairment adjustments have been recorded 
the impairment charge will be allocated to assets within the asset group on a relative fair value basis 
at december   the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair value by million 
at december   the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by million 
in both reporting periods  the undiscounted cash flow test shows that these precious metal assets  primarily in the display technologies segment  are recoverable as part of their asset groupings 
the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments 
such events include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments 
the specialty materials segment recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in the amount of million related to certain assets used in the production of large cover glass due to sales that were significantly below our expectations 
in the fourth quarter of  after reassessing the large cover glass business  corning concluded that the large cover glass market was developing differently in than our expectations  and demand for larger sized cover glass was declining  and the market for this type of glass was instead targeting smaller gen size products 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  our primary customer of large cover glass notified corning of its decision to exit from this display market 
based on these events  we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in the amount of million  before tax 
this impairment charge represents a write down of assets specific to the glass strengthening process for large size cover glass to their fair market values  and includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process 
additional information on the asset impairment is found in note restructuring  impairment and other charges credits  note property  net of accumulated depreciation and note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
corning s goodwill relates primarily to the telecommunications  specialty materials and life sciences operating segments 
on a quarterly basis  management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit to determine whether there have been any triggering events 
the two step impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
we perform a detailed  two step process every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim 
we use this calculation as quantitative validation of the step zero qualitative process that is performed during the intervening periods and does not represent an election to perform the two step process in place of the step zero review 
the following summarizes our qualitative process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment we assess qualitative factors in each of our reporting units which carry goodwill to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount macroeconomic conditions  such as a deterioration in general economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and or other developments in equity and credit markets  market capital in relation to book value  industry and market considerations  such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates  material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing  cost factors  such as an increase in raw materials  labor or other costs  overall financial performance  such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue  other relevant entity specific events  such as material changes in management or key personnel  and events affecting a reporting unit  such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions 
the examples noted above are not all inclusive  and the company shall consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
our two step goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process 
this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows 
our valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon  are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
telecommunications goodwill for the telecommunications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level

restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized 
we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including  for example  employee termination costs 
restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses  of portions thereof  their profitability  cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome 
the judgment involved can be difficult  subjective and complex in a number of areas  including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which  as a result  require impairment 
we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 
income taxes we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies 
these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results  the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies  and the economic environments in which we do business 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 
equity method investments at december  and  the carrying value of our equity method investments was billion and billion  respectively  with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately of the balance 
we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other than temporarily impaired 
when such indicators are present  we then perform an in depth review for impairment 
an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability  forecasted tax rates  foreign currency exchange rate movements  terminal value assumptions  historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
as of december  and  we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 
fair value measures as required  corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable 
observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources  while unobservable inputs are based on the company s own market assumptions 
once inputs have been characterized  we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels 
characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement 
in addition  observable market data must be used when available and the highest and best use measure should be applied to non financial assets 
corning s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short term and long term investments  certain pension asset investments and derivatives 
these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 
derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities 
in arriving at the fair value of corning s derivative assets and liabilities  we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria  including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction 
amounts related to credit risk are not material 
the level assets measured with unobservable inputs relate to certain pension asset investments and all long lived assets fair valued on a nonrecurring basis related to the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass  resulting in an impairment charge of million

probability of litigation outcomes we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law  and other case specific issues 
see part ii item legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face 
the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation 
there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  our history of success in defending asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses  and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives 
the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies 
the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties 
any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal 
for these and other reasons  corning s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters 
the estimate of the cost of resolving the non pcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur 
management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning s financial statements is remote 
other possible liabilities we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters  including certain tax planning and environmental matters  these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense

note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning s funding requirements 
in addition  at december   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by million before tax  and a basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by million 
in addition  the impact of greater than a basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first basis point decrease in the discount rate

revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
in certain instances  revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns  allowances  discounts  and other factors 
these estimates are supported by historical data 
while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning s future results 
share based compensation share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings  and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact our net equity 
we have foreign currency exposure to many currencies including the japanese yen  euro  new taiwan dollar and korean won 
we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and  as such  are referred to as undesignated hedges 
changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges  along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities  are recorded in current period earnings in other income  net in the consolidated statements of income 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments  were million and billion in and  respectively  with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount in equity earnings from samsung corning precision materials totaled million for and billion for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   with respect to open forward contracts  and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  specific to the japanese yen  a adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  specific to the euro  a adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  as we derive approximately of our net sales from outside the us  our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro 
our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during remain constant at january levels 
as an example of impact changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results  we compare actual sales in yen and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a change in the currency exchange rate 
a plus or minus movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million 
a plus or minus movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million 
using net income attributable to corning incorporated as a percentage of net sales of  we can estimate that a plus or minus movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately million 
a plus or minus movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately million 
interest rate risk management it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than of variable rate instruments 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of million of previously issued fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one month libor rate
