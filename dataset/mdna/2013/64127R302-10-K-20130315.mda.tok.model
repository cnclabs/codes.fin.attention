item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or md a  is provided in addition to the accompanying financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our md a is organized as follows executive overview overview discussion of our business in order to provide context for the remainder of md a 
trends outlook discussion of what we view as the overall trends affecting our business and the strategy for critical accounting policies accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts 
results of operations analysis of our financial results comparing the twelve month periods ended december  to the comparable period of liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows and discussion of our financial condition and future liquidity needs 
executive overview we are focused on the development and commercialization of treatments based on human neuronal stem cells and the development and commercialization of treatments using small molecule compounds 
we are headquartered in rockville  maryland and have a wholly owned subsidiary in china 
we have developed and maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications that form the proprietary base for our research and development efforts 
we own or exclusively license thirty us or foreign issued patents and forty two us and foreign patent applications in the field of regenerative medicine  related to our stem cell technologies as well as our small molecule compounds 
at times  including in the third quarter of and the first quarter of  we have licensed the use of our intellectual property to third parties 
all of our research efforts to date are at the pre clinical or clinical stage of development 
we are focused on leveraging our key assets  including our intellectual property  our scientific team and our facilities  to advance our technologies 
in addition  we are pursuing strategic collaborations with members of academia 
we have not derived any revenue or cash flows from the sale or commercialization of our products 
in the past  we have derived limited revenue from the licensing of certain intellectual property to third parties and from consulting fees 
as a result  we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
therefore  we are dependent upon external financing and revenue from collaborative research arrangements with sponsors to finance our operations 
we have no such collaborative research arrangements at this time and there can be no assurance that such financing or partnering revenue will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
before we can derive revenue or cash inflows from the commercialization of any of our proposed product candidates  we will need to i conduct substantial testing of our proposed products  ii undertake preclinical and clinical testing for specific disease indications  and iii  obtain required regulatory approvals 
these steps are risky  expensive and time consuming 
trends outlook for the year ended december  and  we generated no revenues from the sale of our proposed therapies based on our stem cell and small molecule technologies 
we are mainly focused on managing our clinical trials 
we are also pursuing pre clinical studies on other central nervous system indications in preparation for additional clinical trials 
in august of  we were selected as the primary subcontractor for a dod contract awarded to loma linda university entitled research to treat cancerous brain tumors with neural stem cells 
we received  pursuant to this contract through its completion in the second quarter of  and recognized revenue related to this contract of approximately  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we licensed the use of certain of our intellectual property to third parties 
during the twelve months ended december   we recognized revenue of approximately  related to up front payments received under these licenses  since our performance obligations contained in the licenses are substantially complete 
the license agreements also provide for ongoing annual fees which are recognized on a straight line basis over the annual period 
on a long term basis  we anticipate that our revenue will be derived primarily from licensing fees and sales of our cell based therapy and small molecule compounds 
because we are at such an early stage in the clinical trials process  we are not yet able to accurately predict when we will have a product ready for commercialization  if ever 
research development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of contractors charges and personnel expenses associated with clinical trials and regulatory submissions  costs associated with preclinical activities such as proof of principle for new indications  toxicology studies  costs associated with cell and small molecule processing and process development  facilities related costs and supplies 
clinical trial expenses include payments to research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  laboratories for testing clinical samples and consultants 
we focus on the development of treatment candidates with potential uses in multiple indications  and use employee and infrastructure resources across several projects 
accordingly  many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified product and we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
for a further description of these clinical trials  see the section of this report entitled clinical programs contained in item we expect that research and development expenses  which include expenses related to our ongoing clinical trials  will increase in the future  as funding allows and we proceed into our anticipated phase ii trials 
to the extent that it is practical  we will continue to outsource much of our efforts  including product manufacture  proof of principle and preclinical testing  toxicology  tumorigenicity  dosing rationale  and development of clinical protocol and ind applications 
this approach allows us to use the best expertise available for each task and permits staging new research projects to fit available cash resources 
we have formed a wholly owned subsidiary in the people s republic of china 
we anticipate that this subsidiary will primarily i conduct pre clinical research with regard to proposed stem cells therapies  and ii oversee our anticipated future clinical trials in china  including our proposed trial to treat motor deficits due to ischemic stroke 
through december   we have expensed all costs in connection with establishing this new subsidiary and its operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of internal salaries  benefits and other costs associated with  general operations  finance  legal  human resources  information technology  public relations  facilities as well as other external general and administrative services such as legal and accounting fees 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of the notes to audited financial statements included elsewhere herein describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with us gaap  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements use of estimates our financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  we have estimated the expected economic life and value of our licensed technology  our net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes and our share based compensation expenses related to employees  directors  consultants and investment banks 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition historically  our revenue has been derived primarily from i selling treated samples for gene expression data from stem cell experiments  ii providing services under various grants and contracts  and iii through the licensing of the use of our intellectual property 
during the twelve months ended december   we recognized revenue from our services as principal subcontractor pursuant to a dod contract with loma linda university and from the licensing of certain of our intellectual property to third parties 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods and services has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
to date  we have not recognized any revenue from the commercialization of our proposed products and do not anticipate recognizing any revenue therefrom for the foreseeable future 
intangible and long lived assets we assess impairment of our long lived assets using a primary asset approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long lived asset to be held and used 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
during the twelve month periods ended december  and  no significant impairment losses were recognized 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenditures for the research and development of patents and technology  including the costs of pre clinical and clinical trials  which are not capitalizable and charged to operations when incurred 
our research and development costs consist mainly of payroll and payroll related expenses  research supplies and costs incurred in connection with specific research grants 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation at fair value  accordingly we expense the estimated fair value of share based awards over the requisite service period 
share based compensation cost for stock options and warrants is determined at the grant date using an option pricing model  share based compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined at the grant date based on the closing price of our common stock on that date 
the value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
comparison of year ended december  and revenue we did not generate any revenues from the sale of our products in or during and  we recognized revenue of approximately  and  respectively  for our services as principal subcontractor under the dod contract  this contract was completed in the second quarter of during and  we recognized revenue of approximately  and  respectively related to the licensing of certain of our intellectual properties to third parties 
operating expenses operating expenses totaled approximately  and  for and  respectively 
year ended december  increase decrease operating expenses research development costs   general administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization    total expense    research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of contractors charges and personnel expenses associated with clinical trials and regulatory submissions  costs associated with preclinical activities such as proof of principle for new indications  toxicology studies  costs associated with cell and small molecule processing and process development  facilities related costs and supplies 
clinical trial expenses include payments to research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  laboratories for testing clinical samples and consultants 
research and development expenses totaled approximately  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease of approximately  or was primarily attributable to an approximately  decrease in stock based compensation expense coupled with an approximately  decrease in project expenses related to studies that were completed in partially offset by increased salary and related expenses due to additional employees in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of internal salaries  benefits and other costs associated with  general operations  finance  legal  human resources  information technology  public relations  facilities as well as other external general and administrative services such as legal and accounting fees 
general and administrative expenses totaled approximately  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease of approximately  or was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately  in legal expenses primarily related to patent litigation   in stock based compensation expense and  in employee salary and bonus expenses due to the restructuring of our finance and accounting department in april partially offset by an increase of approximately  in consultant fees 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses totaled approximately  and  for and  respectively 
the increase of approximately  is primarily due to increased amortization related to our patent portfolio 
other income expense other income expense totaled approximately  and  for and  respectively 
other income in consisted primarily of interest income 
in  other income consisted primarily of  in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit and approximately  related to gains from changes in the fair value of certain warrant obligations 
settlement of lawsuit on february   we received  from a settlement with reneuron  ltd  ending litigation between the parties 
in addition to the settlement  reneuron agreed to make future milestone payments to neuralstem based on reneuron development of certain products which were at issue in the case 
the success of reneuron s development of these products and our future receipt of any payment milestones  if any  is uncertain 
warrant obligations the gain from the change in fair value of warrant obligations of approximately  in represents the final mark to market adjustment prior to the expiration and exercise of all outstanding derivative warrant liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through the sales of our securities  the exercise of investor warrants  and to a lesser degree from grants and research contracts 
during we raised gross proceeds of approximately  from the issuance of our securities 
currently  our monthly cash burn for operations is approximately  we anticipate that our available cash  expected income and expected proceeds from the sales of our securities will be sufficient to finance our current activities at least through december   although certain activities and related personnel may need to be reduced 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure such additional financing or that the expected income will materialize 
several factors will affect our ability to raise additional funding  including  but not limited to  the volatility of our common shares and general market conditions 
year ended december  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents    net cash used in operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities  total cash and cash equivalents was approximately  at december   compared with approximately  at december  the increase in our cash and cash equivalents of approximately  or approximately  was primarily due proceeds from our capital market activities during partially offset by cash used to fund our operations 
net cash used in operating activities we used approximately  and  of cash in our operating activities during and  respectively 
the increase in cash used was approximately  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in vendor payments partially offset by cash receipts from our dod and license agreements in net cash used in investing activities we used approximately  and  of cash in connection with investment activities during and  respectively 
the decrease in our use of cash of approximately  or was primarily attributable to a decreased level of property and equipment purchases coupled with a decrease in activity related to our patents 
net cash provided by financing activities we raised approximately  and  in net proceeds from the issuance of our securities during and  respectively 
future liquidity and needs we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows since inception 
we have not achieved profitability and may not be able to realize sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we do not expect to be profitable in the next several years  but rather expect to incur additional operating losses 
we have limited liquidity and capital resources and must obtain significant additional capital resources in order to sustain our product development efforts  for acquisition of technologies and intellectual property rights  for preclinical and clinical testing of our anticipated products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  laboratory and office facilities  establishment of production capabilities  for general and administrative expenses and other working capital requirements 
we rely on cash balances and the proceeds from the offering of our securities  exercise of outstanding warrants and grants to fund our operations 
we intend to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through the sale of our securities and additional research grants 
on october   our shelf registration statement registering the sale of up to million of our securities was declared effective by the sec 
we currently have approximately  million remaining under this shelf registration statement 
we anticipate conducting financing in the future based on our current and future shelf registration statements when and if financing opportunities arise 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on our progress in our exploratory  preclinical and future clinical development programs 
funding may not be available when needed  at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
lack of necessary funds may require us  among other things  to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  planned clinical trials  and or our capital expenditures or to license our potential products or technologies to third parties
