item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were established to continue to operate and expand the retail property business of our predecessor 
we commenced our operations in april our assets are held by and all operations are conducted through  directly or indirectly  the operating partnership  of which we are the sole general partner and held a interest as of december  we are operating so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of agree realty corporation  including the respective notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   guidance on how to measure fair value and on what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements will be converged with international standards 
the adoption requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurement  however  the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
effective january   a new accounting standard modifies the options for presentation of other comprehensive income 
the new standard requires us to present comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
the adoption did impact our financial statement disclosures 
effective june   a parent company that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate because that subsidiary has defaulted on its non recourse debt is required to apply real estate sales guidance to determine whether to derecognize the in substance real estate 
the adoption did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
for example  significant estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to revenue recognition  capitalization of costs related to real estate investments  potential impairment of real estate investments  operating cost reimbursements  and taxable income 
minimum rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term 
certain leases provide for additional percentage rents based on tenants sales volumes 
these percentage rents are recognized when determinable by us 
real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
all costs related to planning  development and construction of buildings prior to the date they become operational  including interest and real estate taxes during the construction period  are capitalized for financial reporting purposes and recorded as property under development until construction has been completed 
the viability of all projects under construction or development are regularly evaluated under applicable accounting requirements  including requirements relating to abandonment of assets or changes in use 
to the extent a project  or individual components of the project  are no longer considered to have value  the related capitalized costs are charged against operations 
subsequent to completion of construction  expenditures for property maintenance are charged to operations as incurred  while significant renovations are capitalized 
depreciation of the buildings is recorded on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of forty years 
we evaluate real estate for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets will be written down to fair value and such excess carrying value is charged to income 
the expected cash flows of a project are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including tenants  expected holding period  and availability of credit 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a project to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
during  we recorded no impairment charge related to real estate assets 
during  we recorded impairment charges of million related to the carrying value of our real estate assets 
substantially all of our leases contain provisions requiring tenants to pay as additional rent a proportionate share of operating expenses operating cost reimbursements such as real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  insurance  etc 
the related revenue from tenant billings is recognized in the same period the expense is recorded 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code commencing with our tax year 
as a result  we are not subject to federal income taxes to the extent that we distribute annually of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and satisfy certain other requirements defined in the internal revenue code 
we established trs entities pursuant to the provisions of the internal revenue code 
our trs entities are able to engage in activities resulting in income that would be nonqualifying income for a reit 
as a result  certain activities of our company which occur within our trs entities are subject to federal and state income taxes

we believe that adequate cash flow will be available to fund our operations and pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements for at least the next months 
we may obtain additional funds for future development or acquisitions through other borrowings or the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
although market conditions have limited the availability of new sources of financing and capital  which may have an impact on our ability to obtain financing for planned new development projects in the near term  we believe that these financing sources will enable us to generate funds sufficient to meet both our short term and long term capital needs 
we completed a follow on offering of  shares of common stock in january february of the offering  which included the full exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters  raised net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and other expenses

at december   the mortgage debt of  is recourse debt and is secured by a limited guaranty of payment and performance by us for approximately of the loan amount 
we have entered into mortgage loans which are secured by multiple properties and contain cross default and cross collateralization provisions 
cross collateralization provisions allow a lender to foreclose on multiple properties in the event that we default under the loan 
cross default provisions allow a lender to foreclose on the related property in the event a default is declared under another loan 
as of december   we had four mortgaged properties that were formerly leased to borders that served as collateral for four non recourse loans  which were cross defaulted and cross collateralized crossed loans 
directly or indirectly because of the chapter bankruptcy filing of borders in february  we were in default on the crossed loans as of december  the crossed loans had an aggregate principal outstanding of approximately million as of december  and were secured by the former borders stores in oklahoma city  oklahoma  columbia  maryland  germantown  maryland  and one of the former borders stores in omaha  nebraska

on march   we conveyed the four mortgaged properties  which were subject to the crossed loans  to the lender pursuant to a consensual deed in lieu of foreclosure process that satisfied the loans 
capitalization as of december   our total market capitalization was approximately million 
market capitalization consisted of million of debt including property related mortgages and the credit facility  and million of shares of common stock based on the closing price on the nyse of per share on december  and op units at market value

the op units may  under certain circumstances  be exchanged for our shares of common stock on a one for one basis 
we  as sole general partner of the operating partnership  have the option to settle exchanged op units held by others for cash based on the current trading price of our shares 
assuming the exchange of all op units  there would have been  shares of common stock outstanding at december   with a market value of approximately million

we will periodically refinance short term construction and acquisition financing with long term debt  medium term debt and or equity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditure or capital resources 
inflation our leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on net income 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to pass through to our tenants certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to cost increases and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
certain of our leases contain clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the term of the leases 
in addition  expiring tenant leases permit us to seek increased rents upon re lease at market rates if rents are below the then existing market rates 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit to mean net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  nareit has recently clarified the computation of ffo to exclude impairment charges on depreciable property 
management has restated ffo for prior periods presented accordingly 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
further  while we adhere to the nareit definition of ffo  our presentation of ffo is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definition 
adjusted funds from operations affo is a non gaap financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the reit industry 
affo further adjusts ffo for certain non cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with gaap 
affo should not be considered an alternative to net earnings  as an indication of our performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
management considers affo a useful supplemental measure of our performance 
our computation of affo may differ from the methodology for calculating affo used by other equity reits  and therefore may not be comparable to such other reits 
for and  we calculated ffo  as adjusted  and affo  as adjusted  which exclude from ffo and affo  respectively  certain non recurring gain items that we do not believe are reasonably likely to occur within two years 
the following table provides a reconciliation of ffo and net income for the years ended december   and year ended reconciliation of funds from operations to net income december  december  december  net income loss    depreciation of real estate assets   amortization of leasing costs    amortization of leasing intangibles   impairment charge   gain loss on sale of assets   funds from operations    gain from extinguishment of debt  deferred revenue recognition  lease termination revenue  funds from operations  as adjusted   funds from operations per share dilutive funds from operations per share  as adjusted dilutive weighted average shares and op units outstanding basic    diluted    year ended reconciliation of adjusted funds from operations to net income december  december  december  net income loss    cumulative adjustments to calculate ffo   funds from operations    straight line accrued rent    deferred revenue recognition   stock based compensation expense   amortization of financing costs    capitalized building improvements   adjusted funds from operations   gain on extinguishment of debt  lease termination revenue  adjusted funds from operations  as adjusted  additional supplemental disclosure scheduled principal repayments   item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal payments in thousands and the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt  by year of expected maturity  to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes  assuming no mortgage defaults 
thereafter total fixed rate mortgages payable    average interest rate variable rate notes payable  average interest rate the fair value in thousands is estimated at  and  for fixed rate mortgages and other variable rate debt  respectively  as of december  the table above incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging contracts 
while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates  they also expose us to the risks that the other parties to the agreements will not perform  we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements  the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under gaap guidance 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in to hedge interest rates on million in variable rate borrowings outstanding 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  we will receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount based on plus one month libor and will pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 
this swap effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings to june  as of december   this interest rate swap was valued at a liability of  in addition  in april  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement  for the same variable rate loan  to hedge interest rates on million in variable rate borrowings 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  we will receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount based on one month libor and will pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 
this swap effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings from july  to may  as of december   this interest rate swap was valued at a liability of  on december   the company entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of  effective december  and ending on april  the company entered into these derivative instruments to hedge against changes in future cash flows related to changes in interest rates on  of variable rate borrowings outstanding 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  the company will receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount based on one month libor and will pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 
this swap effectively converted  of variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings beginning on december  and through april  as of december   this interest rate swap was valued at a liability of  we do not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we did not have any other derivative instruments or hedging activities as of december  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates on the portion of our debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately
