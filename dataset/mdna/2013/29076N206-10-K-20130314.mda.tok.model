item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
our fiscal year ends december this document contains certain forward looking statements including  among others  anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations and our business strategy 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
see part i  item a  risk factors 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include i changes in external factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations  ii unanticipated working capital or other cash requirements  iii changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the industries in which we operate  and iv various competitive market factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace 
overview we design  manufacture and supply miniature displays  which we refer to as oled on silicon microdisplays  and microdisplay modules for virtual imaging  primarily for incorporation into the products of other manufacturers 
microdisplays are typically smaller than many postage stamps  but when viewed through a magnifier they can contain all of the information appearing on a high resolution personal computer screen 
our microdisplays use organic light emitting diodes  or oleds  which emit light themselves when a current is passed through the device 
our technology permits oleds to be coated onto silicon chips to produce high resolution oled on silicon microdisplays 
we believe that our oled on silicon microdisplays offer a number of advantages in near to the eye applications over other current microdisplay technologies  including lower power requirements  less weight  fast video speed without flicker  and wider viewing angles 
in addition  many computer and video electronic system functions can be built directly into the oled on silicon microdisplay  resulting in compact systems with lower expected overall system costs relative to alternate microdisplay technologies 
we have devoted significant resources to the development and commercial launch of our oled microdisplay products into military  industrial and medical applications world wide 
first sales of our svga microdisplay began in may and we launched the svga d microdisplay in february in the sxga microdisplay became our first digital display  and in we introduced the vga oled xl  our lowest powered microdisplay  and the wuxga oled xl which exceeds p hd resolution 
as of january   we had a backlog of approximately million in products ordered for delivery through december  as compared to a backlog of million as of january  this backlog consists of non binding purchase orders and purchase agreements 
these products are being applied or considered for near eye and headset applications in products such as thermal imagers  night vision goggles  entertainment headsets  handheld internet and telecommunication appliances  viewfinders  and wearable computers to be manufactured by original equipment manufacturer oem customers 
we have also continued to ship our z dvisor personal display systems 
in addition to marketing oled on silicon microdisplays as components  we also offer microdisplays as an integrated package  which we call microviewer that includes a compact lens for viewing the microdisplay and electronic interfaces to convert the signal from our customer product into a viewable image on the microdisplay 
we have also expanded our design and production activities to include display optical subsystem assemblies for both military and commercial end use products 
we have developed a strong intellectual property portfolio that includes patents  manufacturing know how and unique proprietary technologies to create high performance oled on silicon microdisplays and related optical systems 
we believe our technology  intellectual property portfolio and position in the marketplace  gives us a leadership position in oled and oled on silicon microdisplay technology 
we are one of only a few companies in the world to market and produce significant quantities of high resolution full color small molecule oled on silicon microdisplays 
in we announced the award from itt night vision for design and development of a display optical assembly for the us army enhanced night vision goggle 
we began deliveries to itt exelis under this program in in  we opened additional avenues of growth by securing r d contracts with itt  the department of energy  the us navy and others while completing contracts with tatrc and other government agencies 
we continued display shipments under the felin soldier program  javelin program  us army thermal weapon sight remote viewer program  the viper ii thermal sight program and others 
in  we developed a new xga microdisplay  working with an important new customer  for the electronic view finder market 
we were awarded a follow on contract by the us navy for development of a high brightness  high resolution microdisplay to be used for head mounted avionics applications 
we were also awarded a contract by the us special operations command to optimize our wuxga x microdisplay for mass production and dual use applications 
company history as of january   we were no longer classified as a development stage company 
we transitioned to manufacturing our product and have significantly increased our marketing  sales  and research and development efforts  and expanded our operating infrastructure 
currently  most of our operating expenses are labor related and semi fixed 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues  our net income in any given period could be less than expected 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue and cost recognition revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from the customer  the price is fixed  title and risk of loss to the goods has changed and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
products sold directly to consumers have a thirty day right of return 
revenue on consumer products is deferred until the right of return has expired 
revenues from research and development activities relating to firm fixed price contracts and cost type contracts are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as costs are incurred cost to cost basis 
progress is generally based on a cost to cost approach however an alternative method may be used such as physical progress  labor hours or others depending on the type of contract 
physical progress is determined as a combination of input and output measures as deemed appropriate by the circumstances 
contract costs include all direct material  labor and subcontractor costs and an allocation of allowable indirect costs as defined by each contract  as periodically adjusted to reflect revised agreed upon rates 
these rates are subject to audit by the other party 

index product warranty we offer a one year product replacement warranty 
in general  our standard policy is to repair or replace the defective products 
we accrue for estimated returns of defective products at the time revenue is recognized based on historical activity as well as for specific known product issues 
the determination of these accruals requires us to make estimates of the frequency and extent of warranty activity and estimate future costs to replace the products under warranty 
if the actual warranty activity and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from these estimates  adjustments to cost of revenue may be required in future periods 
use of estimates in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management utilizes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments related to  among others  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  stock based compensation expense  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  litigation and other loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
fair value of financial instruments emagin s cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable  short term investments  and accounts payable are stated at cost which approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
in addition  the long term investments are stated at cost which approximates fair value 
emagin measured the fair value of our warrants based on the monte carlo simulation approach 
stock based compensation emagin maintains several stock equity incentive plans 
the employee stock purchase plan the espp provides our employees with the opportunity to purchase common stock through payroll deductions 
employees may purchase stock semi annually at a price that is of the fair market value at certain plan defined dates 
as of december   the number of shares of common stock available for issuance was  as of december   the plan had not been implemented 
the stock option plan the plan provides for grants of shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
under the plan  an iso grant is granted at the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant and a non iso is granted at a price not to be less than of the market value of the common stock 
these options have a term of up to years and vest over a schedule determined by the board of directors  generally over a five year period 
the amended plan provides for an annual increase in common stock available for issuance by of the diluted shares outstanding on january of each year for a period of years which commenced january  in  there were no options granted from the plan 
the incentive stock plan the plan adopted and approved by the board of directors on november  provides for shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
the plan has an aggregate of  shares 
in  there were no options granted from this plan 
the incentive stock plan the plan adopted and approved by the shareholders on november  provides for shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
the plan has an aggregate of  shares 
in  there were  options granted from this plan 
we account for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors by estimating the fair value of stock awards at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures and is amortized over the vesting period using the straight line method 
see note of the consolidated financial statements stock compensation for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
operating losses and tax credits  to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income also represent deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizabiliy of deferred tax assets  we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that may exist and consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
from inception through  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we were unable to determine that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize them 
in  we determined that based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and based on the weight of the available evidence  including our cumulative taxable income over the past three years and expected profitability in through that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable through future earnings 
accordingly  we reduced our valuation allowance by million and recorded a corresponding tax benefit of million 
at december   we determined based on the weight of the available evidence  both positive and negative  it was more likely than not that million of its deferred tax asset will be realized and no additional valuation allowance was released 
in  we determined that based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and based on the weight of the available evidence  including our continued profitability and our forecasted earnings in through that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable through future earnings 
accordingly  we increased our deferred tax asset to million by recording a million reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recorded a corresponding tax benefit of million 

index in determining future taxable income  assumptions are made to forecast operating income  the reversal of temporary timing differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
management uses significant judgment in the assumptions it uses to forecast future taxable income which are consistent with the forecasts used to manage the business 
realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon future earnings which there is uncertainty as to the timing 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
our effective income tax rate was a benefit of in  compared to a provision of in the year over year change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of a million benefit in due to the reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
results of operations the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before benefit from provision for income taxes income tax benefit expense net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased approximately million to a total of approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december   a increase 
in  there was a increase in display revenue as a result of a increase in the number of displays sold however it was offset by a decrease in the average selling price which was a result of changes in product and customer mix as compared to the increase in display revenue was offset by a decrease in headset revenue as we allocated our production capacity to our customers display products and reduced the production of our d displays 
in  contract revenue decreased as a result of a reduction in funding of research and development contracts 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold is comprised of costs of product revenue and contract revenue 
cost of product revenue includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products 
cost of contract revenue includes direct and allocated indirect costs associated with performance on contracts 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  up from for the year ended december  which is a result of increased labor and material costs as more displays were produced in as compared to the following table outlines product  contract and total gross profit and related gross margins for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands for the year ended december  product revenue gross profit product revenue gross margin contract revenue gross profit contract revenue gross margin total gross profit total gross margin in  total gross profit decreased approximately million or as product revenue gross profit increased approximately million offset by a decrease in contract revenue gross profit of million as compared to gross margin was for the year ended december  down from for the year ended december  product gross margin decreased from in to in due to a decrease in the average selling price  a result of changes in our product and customer mix and an increase in cost of goods sold due to increased production and production inefficiencies 
contract gross margin remained relatively steady at in as compared to in contract gross margin is dependent upon the mix of internal versus external third party costs  with the external third party costs causing a lower gross margin and reducing the contract gross profit 

index research and development expenses research and development expenses include salaries  development materials and other costs specifically allocated to the development of new microdisplay products  oled materials and subsystems 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million as compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase was primarily related to increases in personnel costs and related expenses to support research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs  professional services fees  as well as other marketing  general corporate and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million as compared to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease is primarily related to a decrease in non cash compensation and professional fees offset by an increase in personnel costs 
other income expense other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on investments  interest expense and income applicable to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability 
for the year ended december   interest expense decreased approximately thousand as compared to due to lower interest payments related to our line of credit offset by the capitalization of interest and no interest on liquidated damages expenses related to registration payment arrangements 
we have no debt upon which we are incurring interest expense however we pay fees to keep our line of credit available 
other income for the year ended december  increased thousand as compared to primarily due to interest earned on investments 
change in fair value of warrant liability 
for the year ended december   the change in the fair value of the warrant liability was as we had no warrants that are accounted for as a liability 
for the year ended december   the change in fair value of the warrant liability was income of million primarily due to the change in the common stock price of emagin period over period 
the change in fair value of the warrant liability had no impact on our cash balances  operations  or operating income 
the warrant was modified to remove the anti dilution provisions therefore there will be no change in the fair value of the existing warrant after q income tax benefit expense for the year ended december   income tax benefit was approximately million as compared to an income tax provision of approximately million for the year ended december  in  we incurred income tax of approximately million related to alternative minimum tax of approximately million which is not offset by operating loss carryforwards and approximately million related to state taxes 
due to our continued profitability and projected operating results  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would continue to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the benefit from a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards 
therefore  we recorded a million reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a corresponding income tax benefit 
net income net income totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  and investments as compared to million at december  as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
the decrease in cash was primarily due to cash provided by operations of approximately million offset by cash used in investing activities of approximately million and financing activities of approximately million 
for the year ended december   operating activities provided million in cash  which was attributable to our net income of approximately million  approximately million from the net non cash expenses and the change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
for the year ended december   operating activities provided million in cash  which was attributable to our net income of approximately million and approximately million from the net non cash expenses and offset by the change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
for the year ended december   investing activities used approximately million in cash of which approximately million purchased investments and approximately million purchased equipment primarily for upgrading our production line 
for the year ended december   investing activities used approximately million in cash  which was primarily the result of approximately million in purchases of cds and approximately million for equipment purchases primarily for upgrading our production line 
for the year ended december   financing activities used approximately million in cash of which approximately million was used for dividend payments and approximately million was for the purchase of treasury stock offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately million 
for the year ended december   financing activities provided approximately million in cash which was the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of million offset by the purchase of treasury stock of million 

index credit facility at december   we had a credit facility with access business finance  llc access that provides for up to a maximum amount of million based on a borrowing base equivalent of of eligible accounts receivable 
the interest on the credit facility is equal to the prime rate plus but may not be less than with a minimum monthly interest payment of thousand 
the credit facility will automatically renew on september  for a one year term unless written notice to terminate the credit facility is provided by either party 
we did not draw on our credit facility in or at any time since its inception in september the credit facility contains the customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  we expect our business to experience growth which may result in higher accounts receivable levels and may require increased production and or higher inventory levels 
we anticipate that our cash needs to fund these requirements as well as other operating or investing cash requirements over the next twelve months will be less than our current cash on hand and the cash we anticipate generating from operations 
we anticipate that we will not require additional funds over the next twelve months other than perhaps for discretionary capital spending 
if unanticipated events arise during the next twelve months  we believe we can raise sufficient funds 
however  if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds  we may have to reduce the size of our organization and or be forced to reduce and or curtail our production and operations  all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects 
dividends and stock repurchase plan in december  emagin s board of directors declared a special dividend of per share to all common shares and preferred shares on an as converted basis outstanding 
the dividend in the aggregate amount of approximately million was paid in cash on december  to all shareholders of record on december  this was a one time special dividend 
it is our intention to retain future profits for use in the development and expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes 
future decision to pay cash dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors 
in august  emagin s board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing the company to repurchase common stock not to exceed million in total value 
as of december   approximately million remained under the stock repurchase plan 
we anticipate that cash used for future dividends  if any  and the repurchase plan will come primarily from cash generated from operating activities 
contractual obligations the following chart describes the outstanding contractual obligations of emagin as of december  in thousands payments due by period total year years years operating lease obligations line of credit equipment purchase obligations purchase obligations a total a the majority of purchase orders outstanding contain no cancellation fees except for minor re stocking fees 
effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk we hold our cash in cash and cash equivalents  certificates of deposits and corporate bonds 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities 
at december   we have not withdrawn any funds under our revolving line of credit and therefore do not have any related interest rate risk 
a change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in the year ended december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we do not have any material foreign currency exchange rate risk
