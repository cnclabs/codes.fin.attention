item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are developing our proprietary picop display technology  which can be used by our customers to create high resolution miniature laser display and imaging engines 
our picop display technology utilizes our widely patented expertise in two dimensional micro electrical mechanical systems mems  lasers  optics and electronics to create a high quality video or still image from a small form factor device with lower power needs than conventional display technologies 
our strategy is to develop and supply picop display technology directly or through licensing arrangements to original equipment manufacturers oems in market segments including consumer electronics  automotive  and industrial for integration into their products 
during  we aligned our operations to our ingredient brand strategy  simplifying our operations and resulting in an expected significant reduction to our future cash requirements 
our strategy is to focus our efforts on licensing our technology to partners who will produce display engines based on picop display technology and incorporate the engine into their products 
our development efforts are focused on supporting our customers in their manufacturing and integration and optimizing picop display technology for specific applications 
the primary objective for consumer applications is to provide users of mobile consumer devices such as smartphones  media players  tablet pcs and other consumer electronics products with a large screen viewing experience produced by a small projector either embedded in the device or via an attached accessory 
these potential products would allow users to watch movies and videos  play video games  and display images and other data onto a variety of surfaces  freeing users from the limitations of a small  palm sized screen 
picop display technology could be further modified to be embedded into a pair of glasses to provide the mobile user with a see through or occluded personal display to view movies  play games or access other content 
picop display technology is currently sold by pioneer corporation as part of an aftermarket high resolution head up display hud that projects point by point navigation  critical operational  safety and other information important to the vehicle operator 
with some modification picop display technology could also be embedded into a vehicle or integrated into a portable standalone hud 
picop enabled devices can be used in field based professions such as service repair or sales to view and share information such as schematics for equipment repair  sales data  orders or contact information within a crm application on a larger  more user friendly display 
we also see potential for embedding picop display technology in industrial products where our displays could be used for d measuring and digital signage  enhancing the overall user experience of these applications 
we continue to enter into a limited number of development agreements with commercial and us government customers to develop advanced prototypes and demonstration units based on our light scanning technologies 
we develop and procure intellectual property rights relating to our technology as a key aspect of our business strategy 
we generate intellectual property from our internal research and development activities and our ongoing performance on development contracts 
we also have acquired exclusive rights to various technologies under licensing and acquisition agreements 
we currently sell our showwx line of pico projectors 
in  we reduced our sales and marketing for these products and we do not expect to increase our investment in the showwx product in the future 
we also currently sell our rov hand held bar code scanners  which use our proprietary mems technology  and bar code scanner enabled enterprise solutions 
we reduced our sales and marketing efforts on the bar code product in and we do not expect to increase our investment in the bar code product in the future 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to incur a substantial loss during the fiscal year ending december  key accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the display and image capture industries  information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners  information available from other outside sources  and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following key accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our product sales generally include acceptance provisions 
we recognize product revenue upon acceptance of the product by the customer or expiration of the contractual acceptance period  after which there are no rights of return 
we have entered into agreements with resellers and distributors  as well as selling directly to the public 
sales made to resellers and distributors are recognized using either the sell through method or upon expiration of the contractually agreed upon acceptance period  depending on our ability to reasonably estimate returns 
some of the agreements with resellers and distributors contain price protection clauses  and revenue is recognized net of these amounts 
sales made directly to the public are recognized either upon expiration of the contractual acceptance period after which there are no rights of return  or net of estimated returns and allowances 
provisions are made for warranties at the time revenue is recorded 
our quarterly revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of product orders from customers  production constraints and availability of components and raw materials 
we recognize contract revenue as work progresses on long term  cost plus fixed fee  and fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we have developed processes that allow us to make reasonable estimates of the cost to complete a contract 
when we begin work on the contract and at the end of each accounting period  we estimate the labor  material and other costs required to complete the contract using information provided by our technical team  project managers  vendors  outside consultants and others and compare these to costs incurred to date 
since our contracts generally require some level of technology development to complete  the actual cost required to complete a contract can vary from our estimates 
recognized revenues are subject to revisions as actual cost becomes certain 
revisions in revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
historically  we have made only immaterial revisions in the estimates to complete the contract at each reporting period 
in the future  revisions in these estimates could significantly impact recognized revenue in any one reporting period 
if the us government cancels a contract  we would receive payment for work performed and costs committed to prior to the cancellation 
we recognize contract revenue on the sale of prototype units and evaluation kits upon acceptance of the deliverables by the customer or expiration of the contractual acceptance period  after which there are no rights of return 
we establish an allowance for estimated losses if the estimated cost to complete a contract exceeds the remaining contract value 
the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is first determined 
we determine the estimated cost to complete a contract through a detailed review of the work to be completed  the resources available to complete the work and the technical difficulty of the remaining work 
if the revised estimated cost to complete the contract is higher than the total contract revenue  the entire contract loss is recognized 
the actual cost to complete a contract can vary significantly from the estimated cost  due to a variety of factors including availability of technical staff  availability of materials and technical difficulties that arise during a project 
most of our development contracts are cost plus fixed fee type contracts 
under these types of contracts  we are not required to spend more than the contract value to complete the contracted work 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts and producing prototype units  evaluation kits  showwx and rov units 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing on a contract or producing prototype units  evaluation kits  and accessory pico projector products 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our research and development department and building our manufacturing and technical capabilities and capacity 
our overhead  which includes the costs of procuring  inspecting and storing material  and facility and depreciation costs  is allocated to inventory  cost of product revenue  cost of contract revenue  and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct material purchased for the respective activity 
allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we maintain allowances for uncollectible receivables  including accounts receivable  cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and receivables from related parties 
we review several factors in determining the allowances including the customer and related party past payment history and financial condition 
if the financial condition of our customers or the related parties with whom we have receivables were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist entirely of purchased patents 
the patents are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit  ranging from one to years 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired 
we compare the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related intangible assets or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts 
measurement of an impairment loss for our intangible assets is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a net realizable value basis 
we make significant judgments and estimates to value our inventory and make adjustments to its carrying value 
we review several factors in determining the market value of our inventory including evaluating the replacement cost of the raw materials  the net realizable value of the finished goods  and the likelihood of obsolescence 
if we do not achieve our targeted sales prices  if market conditions for our components or products were to decline or if we do not achieve our sales forecast  additional reductions in the carrying value of the inventory would be required 
employee share based compensation 
we issue share based compensation to employees in the form of options exercisable into our common stock and restricted or unrestricted shares of our common stock 
we account for equity instruments issued to employees using the straight line attribution method of allocating the fair value of share based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award 
the value of restricted or unrestricted shares is determined using the fair value method  which is based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
the value of options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model with estimates of option lives  stock price volatilities and interest rates  then expensed over the periods of service allowing for pre vest forfeitures 
this widely accepted method results in reasonable option values and interperiod expense allocation  and comparability across companies 
changes in the estimated inputs or using other option valuation methods could result in materially different option values and share based compensation expense 
the key accounting policies described above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for us to apply judgment or make estimates 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result to our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our accounting policies  and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles  are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation has not had a material impact on our revenues  or income from continuing operations over the three most recent fiscal years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands product revenue    product revenue primarily includes sales of components under our image by picop ingredient brand business model and sales of our showwx line of accessory pico projectors 
our quarterly and annual revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of product orders from customers  production constraints and availability of components and raw materials 
in  we reduced our sales and marketing effort on our sales of our showwx line of accessory pico projectors and we do not expect to increase our investment in this product line in the future 
product revenue was higher during year ended december  than the same period in  due to sales of components primarily to pioneer corporation for use in their cyber navi automotive heads up display system hud under our image by picop ingredient brand business model and increased sales of our picop display engines compared to the prior periods 
the backlog of product orders at december  was approximately million  compared to million at december  the product backlog is scheduled for delivery within one year 
pioneer has reported a group net loss for the period april to december the group net loss has been attributed in part due to lower financial performance for its car navigation system business 
as a result of this performance  we have reduced our expectations for significant follow on orders for their after market hud product 
contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands government revenue commercial revenue  total contract revenue   we earn contract revenue from performance on development contracts with the us government and commercial customers and from the sale of prototype units and evaluation kits based on our picop display engine and sales of test equipment built specifically for use in picop display engine production 
our contract revenue from development contracts in a particular period is dependent upon when we enter into a contract  the value of the contracts we have entered into  and the availability of technical resources to perform work on the contracts 
our contract revenue from sales of prototype units and evaluation kits may vary substantially due to the timing of orders from customers and potential constraints on resources 
contract revenue was higher during the year ended december  than the same period in due to increased sales of test fixtures  prototype units and evaluation kits in compared to the prior year 
our backlog of development contracts  including orders for prototype units and evaluation kits  at december  was  compared to  at december   all of which is scheduled for completion during the next twelve months 
cost of product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of product revenue   cost of product revenue includes the direct and allocated indirect cost of manufacturing products sold to customers 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in the manufacture of these products 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
in the event that we maintain production capacity in excess of production requirements  cost of product revenue may also include manufacturing overhead associated with the excess capacity 
cost of product revenue for and included inventory write downs of million and million  respectively 
the write downs were primarily for lower of cost or market adjustments to our inventory value to reflect the then current estimated selling price for our inventory  as well as a reserve adjustment for materials which we expect would become obsolete as we introduced new products 
the decrease in cost of product revenue for  compared to  was primarily attributed to a change in product mix from lower margin showwx products to sales of components to support pioneer cyber navi production and decreased inventory write downs compared to the prior year 
during and  we sold inventory which had been previously written down to the lower of cost or market 
accordingly  cost of product revenue for and did not include approximately million and million of previously recognized write downs associated with this inventory 
during  we recorded a credit of approximately  to cost of product revenue as a result of warranty expense lower than previous estimates 
during  we recognized approximately  of warranty expense primarily associated with our picop display engine 
during and  we expensed approximately  and million  respectively  of manufacturing overhead associated with production capacity in excess of production requirements 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the product mix  the level of overhead expense and the volume of direct materials purchased 
cost of contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of contract revenue  the cost of contract revenue was lower in than in as a result of the lower activity on development contracts 
gross margin on contract revenue was significantly higher in compared to in  we recorded losses on two development contracts 
the losses were primarily as a result of our decision to share costs with one customer for development of advanced in vehicle hud prototypes in anticipation of follow on revenue opportunities and excess material costs associated with minimum order quantities for materials required to complete one of our development contracts 
the combined impact of the losses on contracts and lower gross margin was approximately  in the cost of contract revenue as a percentage of revenue was lower in than in primarily as a result of not having recognized contract losses in as we did in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the contract cost mix and the levels of direct and indirect costs incurred 
research and development expense 
change change in thousands research and development    research and development expense consists of compensation related costs of employees and contractors engaged in internal research and product development activities  direct material to support development programs  laboratory operations  outsourced development and processing work  and other operating expenses 
we allocate our research and development resources based on the business opportunity of the available projects  the skill mix of the resources available and the contractual commitments we have made to customers 
the decrease in research and development expense during  compared to the same period in  is primarily attributable to decreased payroll costs associated with reductions in staffing levels compared to the prior year and lower non cash compensation expense resulting from the forfeiture of stock option grants 
we believe that a substantial level of continuing research and development expense will be required to develop additional commercial products using the picop technology 
accordingly  we anticipate our level of research and development spending will continue to be substantial 
sales  marketing  general and administrative expense change change in thousands sales  marketing  general and administrative   sales  marketing  general and administrative expense includes compensation and support costs for marketing  sales  management and administrative staff  and for other general and administrative costs  including legal and accounting services  consultants and other operating expenses 
we believe that under the ingredient brand business model we will have lower sales  marketing  general and administrative spending in the future than had we not implemented the strategy 
the decrease in sales  marketing  general and administrative expense during  compared to the same period in  is primarily due to decreased payroll costs associated with reductions in staffing levels compared to the prior year and lower non cash compensation expense resulting from the forfeiture of stock option grants 
other income and expense 
change change in thousands other income and expense the decrease in other income and expense in from results primarily from lower average cash  investment securities balances  and interest rates 
income taxes 
no provision for income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses from inception through december  at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes 
in addition  we have research and development tax credits of million 
the net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits available to offset future taxable income  if any  will expire in varying amounts from to if not previously utilized 
the research and development tax credits and the remaining net operating losses are scheduled to expire between and in certain circumstances  as specified in the internal revenue code  a or more ownership change by certain combinations of our shareholders during any three year period would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits at december  or at december  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred significant losses since inception 
we have funded operations to date primarily through the sale of common stock  convertible preferred stock  warrants  the issuance of convertible debt and  to a lesser extent  from development contract revenues and product sales 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
based on our current operating plan  we anticipate that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations through the second quarter of we will require additional cash to fund our operating plan past that time 
we are introducing new products into an emerging market which creates significant uncertainty about our ability to accurately project revenue  costs and cash flows 
if the level of sales anticipated by our financial plan is not achieved or our working capital requirements are higher than planned  we will need to raise additional cash sooner or take actions to reduce operating expenses 
we plan to obtain additional cash through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that additional cash will be available or that  if available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us on a timely basis 
if adequate funds are not available on a timely basis we may be required to limit our operations substantially 
this limitation of operations could include reducing our planned investment in development projects resulting in reductions in staff  operating costs  capital expenditures and investment in research and development 
we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  that includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
these financial statements are prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
cash used in operating activities totaled million during  compared to million during during  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by lower personnel costs and increased margins on product sales  as well as savings resulting from steps taken to lower our cash use as described above 
investing activities cash used in investing activities totaled  in compared to cash provided by investing activities of  in in  cash provided by investing activities primarily resulted from reductions in restricted cash used as collateral for our lease and other obligations 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  compared to million in the following is a list of our financing activities during and all share amounts have been adjusted for the reverse stock split discussed in this annual report 
in june  we raised million before issuance costs of approximately  through an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share  a five year term  and are exercisable beginning one year from the date of issuance 
in may  we raised approximately million before issuance costs of approximately  from the sale of million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock to private investors 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share  a three year term  and are exercisable beginning on the date of issuance 
in november  we raised approximately million  before issuance costs of approximately  through an underwritten public offering of million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock 
during  we also raised an aggregate of million  before issuance costs of approximately  from the sale of million shares of our common stock under our committed equity financing facilities with azimuth 
we terminated one of these facilities in july and the other two in november our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the rate at which we can  directly or through arrangements with oems  introduce products incorporating our technology and the market acceptance and competitive position of such products 
future operating expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress of research and development programs  the progress in commercialization activities and arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to establish cooperative development  joint venture and licensing arrangements 
in order to maintain our exclusive rights under our license agreement with the university of washington  we are obligated to make royalty payments to the university of washington with respect to the virtual retinal display technology 
if we are successful in establishing original equipment manufacturer co development and joint venture arrangements  we expect our partners to fund certain non recurring engineering costs for technology development and or for product development 
nevertheless  we expect our cash requirements to remain high as we expand our activities and operations with the objective of commercializing our light scanning technology

the values of cash equivalents and investment securities  available for sale by maturity date as of december   are as follows amount percent cash and cash equivalents  less than one year foreign exchange rate risk all of our development contract payments are made in us dollars 
however  in the future we may enter into development contracts in foreign currencies that may subject us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we have purchase orders and supply agreements in foreign currencies and may enter into such agreements from time to time in the future 
we believe our exposure to currency fluctuations related to these arrangements is not material 
we intend to enter into foreign currency hedges to offset material exposure to currency fluctuations when we can adequately determine the timing and amounts of the exposure
