metric tons in thousands item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations business overview we are a leading global producer and marketer of value added tio tio is used for a variety of manufacturing applications  including plastics  paints  paper and other industrial products 
during  approximately one half of our sales volumes were sold into european markets 
we believe we are the largest producer of tio in europe with an estimated share of european tio sales volumes in in addition  we estimate we have a share of north american tio sales volumes in our production facilities are located throughout europe and north america 
we consider tio to be a quality of life product  with demand affected by gross domestic product  or gdp  and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world 
over the long term  we expect demand for tio will grow by to per year  consistent with our expectations for the long term growth in gdp 
however  even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market  demand for tio in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in gdp  in part due to relative changes in the tio inventory levels of our customers 
we believe that our customers inventory levels are influenced in part by their expectation for future changes in market tio selling prices as well as their expectation for future availability of product 
although certain of our tio 

grades are considered specialty pigments  the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigment products with price and availability being the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service 
the factors having the most impact on our reported operating results are our tio sales and production volumes  tio selling prices  currency exchange rates particularly the exchange rate for the us dollar relative to the euro  the norwegian krone and the canadian dollar and manufacturing costs  particularly raw materials  maintenance and energy related expenses 
our key performance indicators are our tio average selling prices and our level of tio sales and production volumes 
tio 

selling prices generally follow industry trends and the selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures 
in addition  our effective income tax rate in each of  and has been impacted by certain favorable and unfavorable developments discussed below 
executive summary we reported net income of million  or per share for  compared to net income of million  or per share for our earnings per share decreased from to due to lower income from operations in as a result of the unfavorable effects of lower sales and production volumes and higher raw material costs partially offset by higher average selling prices and the favorable effects of a lower effective income tax rate in we reported net income of million  or per share for  compared to net income of million  or per share for our earnings per share increased from to primarily due to the net effects of i higher income from operations in resulting principally from higher average selling prices and higher production volumes in  and ii a non cash deferred income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of net income in includes an aggregate charge of million million  or

critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the recoverability of long lived assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ significantly from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements long lived assets we recognize an impairment charge associated with our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever we determine that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements of accounting standard codification  or asc  topic property  plant and equipment and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
we do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators specified in asc topic are present 
we did not evaluate any long lived assets for impairment during because no such impairment indicators were present 
benefit plans we maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions  or opeb  plans 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses and the reported amounts of pension asset and accrued pension and opeb costs are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
income taxes we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
at december   we have concluded that no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance is required to be recognized with respect to such carryforwards  principally because i such carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period  ii we have utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three year period and iii we currently expect to utilize the remainder of such carryforwards over the long term 
however  prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  if we were to generate losses in our german operations for an extended period of time  it is possible that we might conclude the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point we would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against some or all of the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our tax positions will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
it is possible that in the future we may change our assessment regarding the probability that our tax positions will prevail that would require an adjustment to the amount of our reserve for uncertain tax positions that could either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in assessment was made 
in addition  we evaluate at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our non us subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were to be distributed to the us contingencies we record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
income from operations is impacted by certain of these and other significant judgments and estimates  such as allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investments and long lived assets  defined benefit pension plans and loss accruals 
in addition  net income is impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals 
comparison of to results of operations year ended december  dollars in millions net sales cost of sales gross margin other operating income and expenses  net income from operations change tio operating statistics sales volumes production volumes percentage change in net sales tio product pricing tio sales volumes tio product mix changes in currency exchange rates total thousands of metric tons industry conditions and overview the tio industry has experienced decreased sales and production volumes as the majority of tio producers and consumers have been undertaking inventory correction initiatives in response to continued global economic weakness and uncertainty 
while we operated our production facilities at full practical capacity rates throughout and through the first quarter of  we operated our facilities at reduced rates during the remainder of approximately of practical capacity in the second quarter  approximately in the third quarter and approximately in the fourth quarter to align production levels and inventories to current and anticipated near term customer demand levels 
we increased our tio average selling prices throughout while our average selling prices at the end of the second quarter of were comparable to the end of  our average selling prices declined during the second half of overall our average selling prices in were higher as compared to and our average selling prices at the end of were lower than at the end of we experienced significantly higher costs for our raw materials such as feedstock ore and petroleum coke in overall  the cost per metric ton of tio we produced during was approximately higher as compared to  primarily due to the higher feedstock ore costs and unabsorbed fixed production costs resulting from reduced production volumes 
however  as a substantial portion of the tio products we sold in the first quarter of were produced with lower cost feedstock ore purchased in  our cost of sales per metric ton in the first quarter of was significantly lower as compared to the cost per metric ton for products we sold in the second  third and fourth quarters of the year 
net sales our net sales increased or million in compared to  primarily due to the net effects of a increase in average tio selling prices which increased net sales by approximately million and a decrease in sales volumes which decreased net sales by approximately million 
tio selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures  changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs 
our sales volumes decreased in as compared to due to decreased customer demand in european markets partially offset by higher sales in us and export markets 
in addition  we estimate the unfavorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately million  or  as compared to cost of sales cost of sales increased million or in compared to due to the net impact of higher raw material costs of approximately million primarily feedstock ore and petroleum coke  a decrease in sales volumes  a decrease in production volumes and currency fluctuations primarily the euro 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in compared to in primarily due to the net effects of higher raw material costs  the unfavorable effects of unabsorbed fixed production costs resulting from reduced production volumes and higher average selling prices 
the reduction in our tio production volumes during  as discussed above  resulted in approximately million of unabsorbed fixed production costs which were charged directly to cost of sales 
additionally  reflects the benefit of lower raw material costs in the first quarter of as compared to current costs as lower cost raw materials purchased at the end of were used in the first quarter production process 
gross margin and income from operations income from operations decreased by million from million in to million in income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in this decrease was driven by the decline in gross margin  which decreased to in compared to in as discussed and quantified above  our gross margin has decreased primarily due to the net effects of higher manufacturing costs primarily raw materials  higher selling prices  lower sales volumes and unabsorbed fixed costs related to lower production volumes 
additionally  changes in currency exchange rates have negatively affected our gross margin and income from operations 
we estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased income from operations by approximately million in compared to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at approximately and for and respectively 
other non operating income expense in march  we redeemed million of our senior secured notes and borrowed under our european revolving credit facility in order to fund the redemption 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we repurchased in open market transactions an aggregate million principal amount of our senior notes 
as a result of these redemptions and open market purchases  we recognized a net million pre tax interest charge consisting of the call premium and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the redeemed and repurchased senior notes 
we recognized an aggregate million pre tax charge in the second quarter of related to the early extinguishment of our remaining senior secured notes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized a million securities transaction loss in the fourth quarter of on the sale  pursuant to a tender offer  of our million shares of titanium metals corporation timet stock for million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense decreased million from million in to million in primarily due to the effects of lower average debt levels of our senior secured notes resulting from the march redemption and open market purchases in the third and fourth quarters of in addition  outstanding debt in carried lower average interest rates than in see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income tax provision our income tax provision was million in compared to million in this decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily due to lower income from operations in compared to see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax provision in includes a net incremental tax benefit of million 
we determined during the third quarter that due to global changes in the business we would not remit certain dividends from our non us jurisdictions 
as a result  certain current year tax attributes were available for carryback to offset prior year tax expense and our provision for income taxes in the third quarter included an incremental tax benefit of million 
during the fourth quarter as a result of a change in circumstances related to our sale and the sale by certain of our affiliates of their shares of timet common stock  which sale provided an opportunity for us and other members of our consolidated us federal income tax group to elect to claim foreign tax credits  we determined that we could tax efficiently remit non cash dividends from our non us jurisdictions before the end of the year that absent the timet sale would not have been considered 
our provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of includes an incremental tax related to the non cash dividend distributions of million 
our income tax provision in includes million for us incremental income taxes on current earnings repatriated from our german subsidiary  which earnings were used to fund a portion of the redemption and repurchases of our senior secured notes 
comparison of to results of operations year ended december  dollars in millions net sales cost of sales gross margin other operating income and expenses  net income from operations change tio operating statistics sales volumes production volumes percentage change in net sales tio product pricing tio sales volumes tio product mix changes in currency exchange rates total thousands of metric tons net sales net sales increased or million in compared to  primarily due to a increase in average tio selling prices 
tio selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures  changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs 
while the amount of inventory available for shipment in increased due to higher production volumes during the year  our sales volumes were lower than in as a result of soft demand in the fourth quarter of due to customer destocking 
in addition to the factors discussed above  we estimate the favorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates increased our net sales by approximately million  or  as compared to  while relative changes in mix of the various grades of our products sold decreased our net sales by approximately million  or 
cost of sales cost of sales increased million or in compared to due to the net impact of a increase in tio production volumes  higher raw material costs of million primarily ore and petroleum coke  an increase in maintenance costs of million consistent with the increase in production volumes and currency fluctuations primarily the euro 
overall  our per metric ton cost of tio we produced increased approximately as compared to cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to in compared to in primarily due to the effects of higher selling prices and the benefit of higher production volumes in our tio 

production volumes in established a new record for us for an annual production period 
income from operations income from operations increased by million from million in to million in income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in this increase is driven by the improvement in gross margin  which increased to in compared to in our gross margin increased primarily because of the effect of higher selling prices which more than offset the impact of higher manufacturing costs primarily raw materials and maintenance 
changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal effect on our income from operations in as compared to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at approximately and for and respectively 
other non operating income expense in march  we redeemed million principal amount of our senior secured notes 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we repurchased in open market transactions an aggregate million principal amount of our notes 
we recognized a net million pre tax interest charge related to the redemption and open market purchases of the notes  consisting of the call premium  the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with the redeemed and purchased notes 
interest expense decreased million from million in to million in due to the net effects of the prepayment and open market purchases of a portion of the senior secured notes as discussed above  and changes in currency exchange rates 
the interest expense we recognize will vary with fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 
income tax provision our income tax provision was million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to our increased earnings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax provision in includes million for us incremental income taxes on current earnings repatriated from our german subsidiary  which earnings were used to fund a portion of the redemption and repurchases of our senior secured notes 
our income tax provision in includes a million non cash income tax benefit related to a european court ruling that resulted in the favorable resolution of certain income tax issues in germany and an increase in the amount of our german corporate and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards 
effects of currency exchange rates we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
the majority of our sales from non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations is denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials used worldwide  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased primarily in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are purchased primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
in addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time  our non us operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non local currency sales or operating costs are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non local currency 
overall  we estimate that fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on our sales and income from operations for the periods indicated 
impact of changes in currency exchange rates vs 
transaction gains losses recognized translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs 
change in millions impact on net sales income from operations impact of changes in currency exchange rates vs 
transaction gains losses recognized translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs 
change in millions impact on net sales income from operations the negative impact on income from operations in versus is due to increased currency transaction losses in as compared currency transaction gains in which were a function of the timing of currency exchange rate changes and the settlement of non local currency receivables and payables 
the impact on income from operations in versus was minimal 
outlook during the first quarter of  we operated our production facilities at full practical capacity levels  consistent with our operating rates throughout we operated our facilities at reduced rates during the second  third and fourth quarters of to align our production levels and inventories to current and anticipated near term customer demand levels 
if economic conditions improve in the various regions of the world during  we expect demand for our tio products would increase  and our sales volumes would be expected to be higher in as compared to during  we will continue to monitor current and anticipated near term customer demand levels and align our production and inventories accordingly 
we implemented significant increases throughout and raised prices in certain markets in the first half of  and as a result our average selling prices were higher in as compared to while our average selling prices at the end of the second quarter of were comparable to the end of  our average selling prices declined during the second half of our average selling prices at the end of were lower than at the end of the third quarter of and were lower than at the end of as expected  we experienced significantly higher tio feedstock costs in as compared to driven by tight ore supplies and higher than historical increases in petroleum coke and energy costs 
we had experienced some moderation in the cost of tio feedstock ore procured in  but our cost of sales per metric ton of tio sold in the first quarter of is expected to be higher as compared to our expected cost of sales per metric ton of tio sold in the remainder of  as a substantial portion of the tio products we expect to sell in the first quarter of will have been produced with the higher cost feedstock ore procured in although the cost of feedstock ore has moderated recently  such reductions have been inadequate to compensate for the decline in selling prices for our products 
as a result  we expect to implement increases in our selling prices during in order to adequately compensate for our raw material production costs  as we are starting with selling prices lower than as compared to the start of overall  we expect that income from operations in will be significantly lower as compared to  as the relatively negative effect associated with the impact on our first quarter income from operations resulting from the sale of tio produced with the lower cost feedstock ore purchased in would more than offset the favorable effect of the higher sales and production volumes that would result assuming demand levels improve  as well as the favorable impact of increases in our selling prices that we are able to achieve during our expectations for our future operating results are based upon a number of factors beyond our control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  continued operation of competitors  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions or reductions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities trends in cash flows as a result of our operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in our earnings 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this million decrease was primarily due to the net effects of the following lower income from operations in of million  lower net cash paid for income taxes in of million resulting from lower operating income and the timing of payments  higher net cash used in associated with relative changes in our inventories  receivables  prepaids  payables and accruals of million in  and higher net contributions to our tio 

joint venture in of million  primarily to support the joint venture s higher working capital needs associated with higher cost feedstock ore 
cash flows provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this million increase was primarily due to the net effects of the following items higher income from operations in of million  higher net cash used by increases in our inventories  receivables  payables and accruals of million in  primarily due to relative changes in our inventory levels  as discussed below  higher cash paid for income taxes in of million resulting from our increased profitability  higher net distributions from our tio joint venture in of million due to related changes in their cash requirements  and lower cash paid for interest in of million  primarily due to lower average borrowings in partially offset by the million call premium associated with the redemption of million of our senior secured notes 
changes in working capital are affected by accounts receivable and inventory changes 
as shown below our average days sales outstanding increased from december  to december  as a result of lower average daily net sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of and to timing of collections on receivable balances  and our average days sales in inventory decreased from december  to december   due to higher inventory costs offset by slightly higher volumes in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of for comparative purposes  we have provided prior year numbers below 
december  december  december  days sales outstanding days days days days sales in inventory days days days investing activities our capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures are primarily incurred to maintain and improve the cost effectiveness of our manufacturing facilities 
our capital expenditures during the past three years include an aggregate of approximately million million in for our ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs 
during  we loaned million and subsequently collected million under our unsecured revolving demand promissory note with valhi  sold our million shares of common stock of timet for million and sold million in mutual fund marketable securities

in february  our board of directors declared a first quarter regular quarterly dividend of 
per share  payable on march  to stockholders of record as of march  outstanding debt obligations and borrowing availability at december   our consolidated debt comprised million aggregate borrowings under our new term loan million carrying value  net of unamortized original issue discount  million million under our european revolving credit facility which matures in september and approximately million of other indebtedness 
certain of our credit agreements contain provisions which could result in the acceleration of indebtedness prior to their stated maturity for reasons other than defaults for failure to comply with applicable covenants 
for example  certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined in the agreement of the borrower 
in addition  certain credit agreements contain provisions that could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the outstanding indebtedness indicated above  at december  we have our million european credit facility  under which million million was available for borrowing by our european subsidiaries and our million north american credit facility  which had no borrowings outstanding and million available for borrowing 
in december  our canadian subsidiary entered into a cdn 
million loan agreement with the bank of montreal for the limited purpose of issuing letters of credit 
the facility renews annually 
letters of credit are collateralized by restricted deposits at the bank of montreal million at december  
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants which  among other things  restrict the subsidiary from incurring additional indebtedness in excess of cdn 
million 
at december   an aggregate of cdn 
million letters of credit were outstanding under this facility 
our assets consist primarily of investments in operating subsidiaries  and our ability to service parent level obligations  including our term loan  depends in part upon the distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries  whether in the form of dividends  advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations or otherwise 
the term loan is collateralized by  among other things  a first priority lien on i of the common stock of certain of our us wholly owned subsidiaries  ii of the common stock or other ownership interest of our canadian subsidiary kronos canada  inc and certain first tier european subsidiaries kronos titan gmbh and kronos denmark aps and iii a million unsecured promissory note issued by our wholly owned subsidiary  kronos international  inc kii 
the term loan is also collateralized by a second priority lien on our us assets which collateralize our north american revolving facility 
our north american revolving credit facility is collateralized by  among other things  a first priority lien on the borrower s trade receivables and inventories 
our term loan and our north american revolver contain a number of covenants and restrictions which  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional debt  incur liens  pay dividends or merge or consolidate with  or sell or transfer substantially all of our assets to  another entity  and contains other provisions and restrictive covenants customary in lending transactions of this type 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  we voluntarily prepaid an aggregate million principal amount of our term loan  using million of our cash on hand as well as borrowings of million under a new loan from contran 
we expect to recognize a non cash pre tax interest charge of approximately million in the first quarter of consisting of the write off of unamortized original issue discount costs and deferred financing costs associated with such prepayment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
it is possible we might borrow additional amounts from contran in the future to voluntarily prepay the remaining million principal amount outstanding under the term loan 
the independent members of our board of directors approved the terms and conditions of the new loan from contran 
liquidity our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is cash flows from operating activities which is generally used to i fund working capital expenditures  ii repay any short term indebtedness incurred for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
from time to time we will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we will also from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business and use the proceeds to i repay existing indebtedness  ii make investments in marketable and other securities  iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iv pay dividends 
the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions significantly impact earnings and operating cash flows 
changes in tio pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect our liquidity 
we routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our dividend policy  our debt service  our capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in our subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of these steps or other steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies 
in the normal course of our business  we may investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the tio 

industry 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunity  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing our equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
at december   we had credit available under our european credit facility of approximately million and approximately million under our north american revolving credit facility 
at december   we could borrow under our credit facilities without violating any existing covenants 
we believe we will be able to comply with the financial covenants contained in such credit facility through its maturity  however if future operating results differ materially from our expectations we may be unable to maintain compliance 
based upon our expectation for the tio 

industry and anticipated demands on cash resources  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our short term obligations defined as the twelve month period ending december  and our long term obligations defined as the five year period ending december   our time period for long term budgeting 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
stock repurchase program in december our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock in open market transactions  including block purchases  or in privately negotiated transactions at unspecified prices and over an unspecified period of time 
to date  we have not made any repurchases under the plan and all million shares are available for repurchase

debt and other contractual commitments as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various debt  lease and other agreements which contractually and unconditionally commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes   and to our consolidated financial statements 
the timing and amount shown for our commitments in the table below are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments of ours and our consolidated subsidiaries as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payment due date contractual commitment and after total in millions indebtedness interest payments on indebtedness operating leases long term supply contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock long term service and other supply contracts fixed asset acquisitions estimated tax obligations a significant portion of the amount shown for indebtedness relates to our term loan million at december  which includes unamortized original issue discount at december  
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts shown for interest for any outstanding variable rate indebtedness is based upon the december  interest rates and assumes that such variable rate indebtedness remains outstanding until maturity 
our contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock contain fixed quantities that we are required to purchase  or specify a range of quantities within which we are required to purchase based on our feedstock requirements 
the pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated quarterly 
the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to the supply contracts for tio feedstock are based upon our current estimate of the quantity of material that will be purchased in each time period shown  the payment that would be due based upon such estimated purchased quantity and an estimate of the prices for the various suppliers which is primarily based on first quarter pricing 
the actual amount of material purchased and the actual amount that would be payable by us  may vary from such estimated amounts 
our obligation for the purchase of tio feedstock is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements and above in business raw materials 
the amounts shown in the table above include the feedstock ore requirements from contracts we entered into in january the amounts shown for the long term service and other supply contracts primarily pertain to agreements we have entered into with various providers of products or services which help to run our plant facilities electricity  natural gas  etc  utilizing december  exchange rates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount shown for estimated tax obligations is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during the above table does not reflect any amounts we might pay to fund our defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans  as the timing and amount of any such future fundings are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the future performance of defined benefit pension plan assets  interest rate assumptions and actual future retiree medical costs 
we expect to be required to contribute an aggregate of approximately million to our defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans during such defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans are discussed below in greater detail 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
any amounts we might pay to settle any of our uncertain tax positions  as the timing and amount of any such future settlements are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the timing of tax audits 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  and any amounts we might pay to acquire tio from our tio manufacturing joint venture  as the timing and amount of such purchases are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the amount of tio produced by the joint venture in the future and the joint venture s future cost of producing such tio however  the table does include amounts related to our share of the joint venture s ore requirements necessary to produce tio for us 
see item  business and note to our consolidated financial statements 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchase  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
defined benefit pension plans we maintain various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
under defined benefit pension plan accounting  defined benefit pension plan expense and pension assets and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
we recognize the full funded status of our defined benefit pension plans as either an asset for overfunded plans or a liability for underfunded plans in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us and will generally differ from pension expense for financial reporting purposes 
we made contributions to all of our plans which aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates we use for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate discount rates and these advisors may in some cases use their own market indices 
we adjust these discount rates as of each december valuation date to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
we use these discount rates to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december of that year 
we also use these discount rates to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligations related to our plans in germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different discount rate assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligation and expense 
this is because we maintain defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in europe and north america and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
we used the following discount rates for our defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in obligations at december  and expense in germany canada norway us the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan  the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year and an estimate of the amount of contributions to and distributions from the plan during the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately   and of the plan assets related to our plans in the germany  canada  norway and the us  respectively 
we use several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense 
this is because the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  we consider the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of our plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate long term rates of return 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below in germany  the composition of our plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
in canada  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities  to fixed income securities  to other investments and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
we expect the long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
in norway  we currently have a plan asset target allocation of to equity securities  to fixed income securities  to real estate and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately   and  respectively 
in the us substantially all of the assets are invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold c 
simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt and is a member of the cmrt investment committee 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices  while utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
prior to december  the cmrt had an investment in timet common stock  however  on december  the cmrt sold its shares of common stock in conjunction with the tender offer 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during the history of the cmrt from its inception in through december   the average annual rate of return has been 
our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows december  germany canada norway cmrt equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate other total december  germany canada norway cmrt equity securities and limited partnerships fixed income securities real estate other total we regularly review our actual asset allocation for each non us plan and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the cmrt trustee and investment committee do not maintain a specific target asset allocation in order to achieve their objectives  but instead they periodically change the asset mix of the cmrt based upon  among other things  advice they receive from third party advisors and their expectations regarding potential returns for various investment alternatives and what asset mix will generate the greatest overall return 
our assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows germany canada norway us we currently expect to use the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as we used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of our plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  we generally base the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of net pension asset and net pension liability will vary based upon relative changes in currency exchange rates 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter than assumed in mortality tables  which are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality table themselves or plan amendments  will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
these amounts are recognized in other comprehensive income 
in addition  any actuarial gains generated in future periods would reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods would reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains 
during  all of our defined benefit pension plans generated a combined net actuarial loss of approximately million 
this actuarial loss resulted primarily from the general reduction in discount rates from december  to december   partially offset by an actual return on plan assets during in excess of the expected return 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  we expect to be required to contribute approximately million to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
we believe all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if we had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all plans as of december   our aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date and our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if we lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of our plans  our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately 
million during opeb plans certain of our subsidiaries in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under other postretirement employee benefits opeb accounting  opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
we recognize the full unfunded status of our opeb plans as a liability 
we recognized consolidated opeb cost of approximately million in  
million in and 
million in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated 
million in and 
million in each of and substantially all of our us accrued opeb cost relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current us employees 
some of our canadian employees are earning opeb benefits 
our expected opeb benefit payments for are expected to be similar to those paid in the discount rates we use for determining opeb expense and the related opeb obligations are based on current interest rates earned on high quality bond yields in the applicable country where the benefits are being paid 
in addition  we receive third party advice about appropriate discount rates and these advisors may in some cases use their own market indices 
we adjust these discount rates as of each valuation date to reflect then current interest rates on such bonds 
we use these discount rates to determine the actuarial present value of the opeb obligations as of december of that year 
we also use these discount rates to determine the interest component of opeb expense for the following year 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider our actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  we have assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during  we expect our consolidated opeb expense will approximate 
million in in comparison  we expect to be required to make approximately 
million of contributions to such plans during we believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if we had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all plans as of december   our aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately 
million at that date and our opeb cost would be expected to increase by approximately 
million during if assumed a one percent change in assumed health care trend rates for all plans  our opeb costs would be expected to increase by approximately 
million during operations outside the united states as discussed above  we have substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of our assets and liabilities related to our non us operations  and therefore our consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   we had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar and norwegian krone 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december   the majority of our aggregate indebtedness comprised variable rate instruments 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for our aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  information shown below for our non us dollar denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using an exchange rate of us per euro 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
amount indebtedness carrying value fair value interest rate maturity date in millions december  variable rate indebtedness term loan dollar denominated european credit facility euro denominated december  fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated senior secured notes currency exchange rates we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   we had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million 
certain of our sales generated by our non us operations are denominated in us dollars 
we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of currency exchange rate risk associated with trade receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales 
we have not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past  nor do we currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future 
at december   we held currency forward contracts to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of norwegian kroner at exchange rates ranging from kroner to kroner per us dollar 
these contracts with dnb nor bank asa mature from january through may at a rate of million per month  subject to early redemption provisions at our option 
the estimated fair value of such currency forward contracts at december  was a million net asset  which amount is recognized as part of accounts and other receivables in our consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding million currency transaction gain in our consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent we held such contracts during  and  we did not use hedge accounting for any of our contracts 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
marketable security prices we are exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which we own 
the fair value of securities which includes investments in mutual funds and in publicly traded shares of related parties was million and million  respectively  at december  and december  the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and december  raw materials we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices relating to our raw materials 
as discussed in item we generally enter into long term supply agreements for certain of our raw material requirements including tio feedstock 
many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase  or specify a range of quantities within which we are required to purchase 
raw material pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated quarterly or semi annually depending upon the suppliers 
for certain raw material requirements we do not have long term supply agreements either because we have assessed the risk of the unavailability of those raw materials and or the risk of a significant change in the cost of those raw materials to be low  or because long term supply agreements for those raw materials are generally not available 
other we believe there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in exchange rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect our results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for our products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses we would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in exchange rates were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by us of future events  gains or losses
