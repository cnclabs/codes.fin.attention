we have strategic relationships with several of these customers for technology development and marketing 
we sell our wireless broadband solutions primarily to wireless operators either directly or through strategic relationships  as well as to oem partners and distributors located worldwide 
most of our mobile computing product sales to wireless operators and oem partners are sold directly by our sales force  or to a lesser degree  through distributors 
we sell our mm solutions primarily to enterprises in the following industries transportation  energy and industrial automation  security and safety  and medical monitoring 
we sell our mm solutions through our direct sales force and through distributors 
we intend to continue to identify and respond to our customers needs by introducing new product designs with an emphasis on supporting cutting edge wide area network  or wan  technology  ease of use  performance  size  weight  cost and power consumption 
we manage our products through a structured life cycle process  from identifying initial customer requirements through development and commercial introduction to eventual phase out 
during product development  emphasis is placed on innovation  time to market  performance  meeting industry standards and customer product specifications  ease of integration  cost reduction  manufacturability  quality and reliability 
the hardware used in our solutions is produced by contract manufacturers 
their services include component procurement  assembly  testing  quality control  and fulfillment 
we have agreements with inventec appliances corporation  or iac  hon hai precision industry co  ltd  and benchmark electronics for the 
table of contents outsourced manufacturing of our products 
under our manufacturing agreements  contract manufacturers provide us with services including component procurement  product manufacturing  final assembly  testing  quality control  and fulfillment 
in addition  we have an agreement with mobiltron for certain distribution  fulfillment and repair services related to our business in europe  the middle east and africa  or emea 
factors which may influence future results of operations net revenues 
we believe that our future net revenues will be influenced largely by the speed and breadth of the demand for wireless access to data through the use of next generation networks including demand for g and g products  g and g data access services  particularly in north america  europe and asia  customer acceptance for our new products that address these markets  including our mifi line of intelligent mobile hotspots  and our ability to meet customer demand 
factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following economic environment and related market conditions  increased competition from other wireless data modem suppliers as well as suppliers of emerging devices that contain a wireless data access feature  demand for broadband access services and networks  rate of change to new products  timing of deployment of g networks by wireless operators  decreased demand for ev do and hspa products  and changes in technologies 
we anticipate introducing additional products during the next twelve months  including g broadband access products  mm solutions and software applications and platforms 
we continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless and computing industry leaders like qualcomm  sprint  verizon wireless  at t  texas instruments  and major software vendors 
through strategic relationships  we have been able to increase market penetration by leveraging the resources of our channel partners  including their access to distribution resources  increased sales opportunities and market opportunities 
as a result of the extremely competitive market for wireless devices  we have experienced significant downward pressure on the average selling prices of our products 
this pressure has the potential to materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in future periods and we cannot predict the magnitude or timing of future reductions in the average selling prices of our products 
cost of net revenues 
all costs associated with our contract manufacturers  as well as distribution  fulfillment and repair services are included in our cost of net revenues 
cost of net revenues also includes warranty costs  amortization of intangible assets  royalties  operations overhead  costs associated with the company s cancellation of purchase orders  costs related to outside services and costs related to inventory adjustments  including write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products  which is influenced by the factors discussed above 
operating costs and expenses 
many of our products target wireless operators and other customers in north america  europe  and asia 
we will likely develop new products to serve these markets  resulting in increased research and development expenses 
we have incurred these expenses in the past and expect to continue to incur these expenses in future periods prior to recognizing net revenues from sales of these products 
our operating costs consist of four primary categories research and development costs  sales and marketing  general and administrative costs  and amortization of purchased intangibles 

table of contents research and development are at the core of our ability to produce innovative  leading edge products 
this category consists primarily of engineers and technicians who design and test our highly complex products 
as we work to expand our portfolio of products and remain competitive  it may be necessary to increase our research and development costs in the future 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of our sales force and product marketing professionals 
in order to maintain strong sales relationships  we provide co marketing  trade show support  product training and demo units for merchandising 
we are also engaged in a wide variety of activities  such as awareness and lead generation programs as well as product marketing 
other marketing initiatives include public relations  seminars and co branding with partners 
general and administrative expenses include primarily corporate functions such as accounting  human resources  professional legal fees  administrative support  and professional fees 
this category also includes the expenses needed to operate as a publicly traded company  including sarbanes oxley compliance  sec filings  stock exchange fees  and investor relations expense 
although general and administrative expenses have been relatively stable and are not directly related to revenue levels  certain expenses such as litigation settlements and provisions for bad debts may impact future general and administrative expenses 
amortization of purchased intangibles includes the amortization of customer relationships  covenant not to compete agreements and trade name intangible assets purchased through the acquisition of enfora 
we also subject our intangible assets and goodwill to impairment assessments when required which can result in charges when impairment occurs 
as part of our business strategy  we review  and intend to continue to review  acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business 
if we make any acquisitions  we may incur substantial expenditures in conjunction with the acquisition process and the subsequent assimilation of any acquired business  products  technologies or personnel 
merger acquisition activities acquisition of enfora on november   the company completed its acquisition of enfora  a provider of intelligent asset management solutions utilizing wireless technology and mm communications 
the acquisition of enfora diversifies the company s customer base and product lines into adjacent markets and advances the company s strategy of providing intelligent devices to more end markets enterprise  consumer and vertical applications 
enfora s results of operations and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition

mm products and solutions 
net revenues from our mm products and solutions segment for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million compared with million in net revenues for the previous year 
the decrease is primarily due to the reduced sales volume and pricing of our g gprs mm modules in the north american market as it transitions away from g gsm networks  and the loss of one of our larger customers for the mm segment 
we continue to develop cdma and g gsm modules and integrated solutions to address this market 
we launched a cdma module in the fourth quarter of and expect to launch other products in product categories 
we have categorized the combined product portfolios of the mobile computing and mm businesses into three categories mobile broadband devices  embedded solutions and asset management solutions and services 
these categories were established due to the different markets and sales channels served 
we believe this product categorization facilitates the analysis of our operating trends and enhances our segment disclosures

this may require us in future periods to record inventory write downs to reflect lower of cost or market adjustments and revalue certain assets that may become impaired 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was approximately million  or of net revenues  as compared to approximately million  or of net revenues in the gross profit percentage remained flat as compared to the same period in we expect that our gross profit percentage will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on product mix  competitive selling prices  our ability to reduce product costs and changes in unit volume 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of net revenues  compared to approximately million  or of net revenues in research and development expenses for the year ended december  were lower as compared to the same period in due to reduced labor cost attributed to headcount reductions  lower software amortization costs  and lower engineering build materials and outside testing services 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expenses primarily related to the termination of our employee stock purchase plan in the fourth quarter of we believe that focused investments in research and development are critical to our future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to our core business strategy 
as such  we expect to make further investments in research and development to remain competitive 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues are expected to fluctuate in future periods depending on the amount of revenue recognized  and potential variation in the costs associated with the development of our products  including the number and complexity of the products under development and the progress of the development activities with respect to those products

revenue recognition 
the company s revenue is principally generated from the sale of wireless modems to wireless operators  oem customers and value added resellers and distributors 
in addition  the company generates revenue from the sale of asset management solutions utilizing wireless technology and mm communication devices to transportation and industrial companies  medical device manufacturers and security system providers 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon the later of transfer of title or delivery of the product to the customer 
where the transfer of title or risk of loss is contingent on the customer s acceptance of the product  we will not recognize revenue until both title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of when revenue recognition criteria are met 
we have granted price protection to certain customers in accordance with the provisions of the respective contracts and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions 
we estimate the amount of price protection for current period product sales utilizing historical experience and information regarding customer inventory levels 
to date  we have not incurred material price protection obligations 
revenues from sales to certain customers are subject to cooperative advertising allowances 
cooperative advertising allowances are recorded as an operating expense to the extent that the advertising benefit is separable from the revenue transaction and the fair value of that advertising benefit is determinable 
to the extent that such allowances either do not provide a separable benefit to us  or the fair value of the advertising benefit cannot be reliably estimated  such amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we establish reserves for estimated product returns allowances in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating future product returns  we consider various factors  including our stated return policies and practices and historical trends 
predominantly all of the revenues represent the sale of hardware with accompanied software that is essential to the functionality of the hardware 
the company records revenue associated with the agreed upon price on hardware sales  and accrues any estimated costs of post delivery performance obligations  such as warranty 
table of contents obligations 
the company considers the four basic revenue recognition criteria discussed under staff accounting bulletin when assessing appropriate revenue recognition as follows criterion persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist  criterion delivery has occurred  criterion the company s price to the buyer must be fixed or determinable  and  criterion collectibility is reasonably assured 
under asu  in multiple element arrangements  the total consideration received from customers must be allocated to the elements based on a relative selling price 
the accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendors specific objective evidence vsoe  ii third party evidence tpe  and iii best estimate of selling price esp 
because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe  revenue has been based on the company s esp 
amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of the sale provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
amounts allocated to other deliverables based upon esp are recognized in the period the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
our prices are determined based upon cost to produce our products  expected order quantities and acceptance in the marketplace 
in addition  when developing esps for products we may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist  and product specific business objectives 
we account for multiple element arrangements that primarily consist of software licenses and post contract support pcs by recognizing revenue for such arrangements ratably over the term of the pcs as we have not established vsoe for the pcs element 
for the years ended december    and  we have not recorded any significant revenues from multiple element or software arrangements 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses  and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  we review our customers credit worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services  our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers industries 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
write downs in inventory value or losses on inventory purchase commitments depend on various items  including factors related to customer demand  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
whenever inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve 
we believe that  when made  the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if customer demand for our inventory is substantially less than our estimates  inventory write downs may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents valuation of acquired intangible assets 
in determining the enfora purchase price allocation  the company considered  among other factors  its intention to use the acquired assets and the historical and estimated future demand for enfora products and services 
the estimated fair value of intangible assets was based upon the income approach 
the income approach relies on an estimation of the present value of the future monetary benefits expected to flow to the owner of an asset during its remaining economic life 
this approach requires a projection of the cash flow that the asset is expected to generate in the future 
the projected cash flow is discounted to its present value using a rate of return  or discount rate that accounts for the time value of money and the degree of risks inherent in the asset 
the expected future cash flow that is projected should include all of the economic benefits attributable to the asset  including the tax savings associated with the amortization of the intangible asset value over the tax life of the asset 
the income approach may take the form of a relief from royalty methodology  a cost savings methodology  a with and without methodology  or excess earnings methodology  depending on the specific asset under consideration 
the relief from royalty method was used to value the trade name acquired from enfora 
the relief from royalty method estimates the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset that would otherwise be required to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset 
the royalty rate used was based on an analysis of empirical  market derived royalty rates for guideline intangible assets 
typically  revenue is projected over the expected remaining useful life of the intangible asset 
the royalty rate is then applied to estimate the royalty savings 
the key assumptions used in valuing the existing trade name acquired were as follows royalty rate of  discount rate of  tax rate of and an economic life of approximately years 
the developed technologies  customer relationships and backlog were valued using a form of the income approach known as the multi period excess earnings method 
inherent in the multi period excess earnings method is the recognition that  in most cases  all of the assets of the business  both tangible and intangible  contribute to the generation of the cash flow of the business and the net cash flows attributable to the subject asset must recognize the support of the other assets which contribute to the realization of the cash flows 
the contributory asset charges are based on the fair value of the contributory assets and either pre tax or after tax cash flows are assessed charges representing returns on the contributory assets 
a contributory asset charge for the use of the technology was assessed on pre tax cash flows  while contributory asset charges for the use of the working capital  fixed assets  and assembled work force have been deducted from the after tax cash flow in each year to determine the net future cash flow attributable to the relationships 
this future cash flow was then discounted using an estimated required rate of return for the asset to determine the present value of the future cash flows attributable to the asset 
the key assumptions used in valuing the developed technologies acquired were as follows discount rate of  tax rate of and estimated average economic life of years 
the key assumptions used in valuing the customer relationships acquired are as follows discount rate of  tax rate of and estimated average economic life of years 
the key assumptions used in valuing the backlog acquired are as follows discount rate of  tax rate of and estimated average economic life of months 
the covenant not to compete agreements were valued using the with or without method 
the with or without method measures the value of an asset as the difference between two scenarios 
one scenario measures the value of a business with the asset 
the other scenario measures the value without the asset 
the method treats the difference between the two scenarios with certain valuation adjustments as the value of the asset 
the key assumptions used in valuing the covenant not to compete agreements were as follows discount rate of and estimated average economic life of years 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we periodically assess the valuation of intangible and long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents our assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of intangible and long lived assets to their associated undiscounted expected future cash flows  which are determined using an expected cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
the timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value 
we monitor our intangible and long lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value intangible and long lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the majority of our long lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over two to four years 
as most of these assets are associated with technology or trade conditions that may change rapidly  such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis 
during the first and third quarters of  based on actual operating results  and reductions in management s then estimates of forecasted operating results of the mm products and solutions reporting unit principally due to updated views of competitive pressures impacting average selling prices  customer product and technology selections  and the loss of certain customers  the company determined there were sufficient indicators of impairment present to require an interim impairment analysis during the respective impacted quarters 
the company performed fair value tests with the assistance of third party independent appraisals  for each of the company s purchased intangible assets 
the existing trade name acquired was valued using royalty rates ranging from to and discount rates ranging from to 
the developed technologies were valued using discount rates ranging from to 
the backlog was valued using discount rates ranging from to 
customer relationships were valued using discount rates ranging from to 
all key assumptions assumed tax rates of  and the assets were assumed to have economic lives ranging from months to years depending on the asset 
goodwill 
our goodwill resulted from the acquisition of enfora mm products and solutions in the fourth quarter of in accordance with the fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  we reviewed goodwill for impairment at least annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year  and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances occurred that indicated a potential reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
asc topic requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
in order to perform the annual goodwill impairment analysis  we are required to estimate the fair value of our mm products reporting unit 
the fair value is calculated as though the mm products and solutions reporting unit were to be sold in its entirety in an orderly transaction between market participants  using an estimate of fair value based on a blended sum resulting from the use of two valuation methods 
first  we use the guideline public company method utilizing a multiple of the reporting unit s revenue 
second  we perform a discounted cash flow analysis using forward looking projections of an estimate of our future operating results 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including the size and timing of product deployments by our customers and related projections and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting 
table of contents the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  stage of products in development  determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
the resultant estimated fair value of our mm products and solutions reporting unit is compared to the net book value of the reporting unit to assess whether any impairment exists 
contingent consideration 
contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date estimated fair value of the contingent payment for all acquisitions 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period with any adjustments in fair value included in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
provision for warranty costs 
we accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related replacement  repairs or rework of products 
our warranty policy generally provides one to three years of coverage for products following the date of purchase 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized 
in estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors  including the historical frequency and volume of claims  and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty 
the warranty provision for our products is determined by using a financial model to estimate future warranty costs 
our financial model takes into consideration actual product failure rates  estimated replacement over the contractual warranty period  repair or rework expenses  and potential risks associated with our different products 
the risk levels  warranty cost information  and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated  if and when  these inputs change 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex products 
depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing  actual product failure rates or actual warranty costs could be materially greater than our estimates  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable to or refundable by tax authorities in the current fiscal year 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if  based on the consideration of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering available evidence 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in a decrease in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
we will continue to evaluate the level of valuation allowance required based on the remaining deferred tax assets 
the american taxpayer relief act of  which reinstated the united states federal research and development tax credit retroactively from january  through december   was not enacted into law until the first quarter of therefore  the expected tax benefit resulting from such reinstatement for will not be reflected in the company s estimated annual effective tax rate until the company recognizes the impact of uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
uncertain tax positions are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met or from changes in circumstances such as the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations 

table of contents litigation 
the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
the company will record a loss when the company determines information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates the loss is both probable and estimable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  the company records the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  the company assesses the potential liability related to the company s pending litigation and revises its estimates  if necessary 
the company s policy is to expense litigation costs as incurred 
share based compensation expense 
we have stock incentive plans under which incentive stock options and restricted stock units have been granted to employees and non employee members of our board of directors 
we also had an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees 
share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  are recognized in the financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards and stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is principally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods 
we have estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights as of the date of grant or assumption using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable 
the black scholes model considers  among other factors  the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of our stock price 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and stock purchase rights on a quarterly basis 
although the black scholes model is an acceptable model  the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards  as it does not consider other factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
compensation cost associated with grants of restricted stock units are measured at fair value  which has historically been the closing price of the company s stock on the date of the grant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits our credit exposure to any single issuer 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  all of which are stated at fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of our million in cash equivalents at december   as these consisted of money market funds with the value of all of our cash equivalents determined based on level inputs  which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
at december   substantially all of our marketable securities are invested in fixed income products 
as such  our investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
due in part to these factors  our future investment market values and income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be other than temporary 
using a model that estimates the aggregate yield to maturity of our investment portfolio  we estimate that basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  our million in marketable securities by approximately  however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale within the meaning of asc topic  no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless 
table of contents such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
we do not utilize derivative instruments or other financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
credit risk we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and our marketable debt securities  which include various security holdings  types and maturities  with a number of financial institutions 
as of the date of this report  we have not identified any significant credit risk associated with any of the financial institutions that maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities 
however  our ability to support our working capital needs depends  in part  on our available cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
as a result  any significant decrease in the value of our investments may materially adversely impact our ability to support our working capital needs 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards specified in our investment policy guidelines at the time the investments are made 
at december   we have cash and cash equivalents of million 
of this million  million is held in cash demand deposits and million in cash equivalents was held in money market investments and us treasury securities 
money market funds attempt to maintain a net asset value  or nav  of per unit of investment 
should the underlying investments held by these money market funds suffer significant losses to market value due to interest rate changes or perceived counterparty risk  the nav of these money market funds may suffer declines below the targeted nav 
we hold money market funds that target a balance of investment return and preservation of invested capital through diversified holdings 
as such  we do not believe we currently have significant exposure to nav declines for our money market holdings 
at december   we had million invested in our portfolio of marketable securities 
our investment policy guidelines limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the fair value of our marketable debt securities at december  was determined based on level inputs  which were derived based on quoted prices for identical or similar assets  which had few transactions near the measurement period see note to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we generate euro denominated accounts receivable from sales to customers that are members of the european union 
during the year ended december   euro denominated revenue was approximately million which represents less than of our total net revenues compared to less than in the same period last year 
although we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  principally the change in the value of the euro versus the us dollar  as euro denominated revenue is not considered significant  we did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts during the year ended december  if our net revenues increase in the foreseeable future  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate this risk 
these forward currency foreign exchange contracts would cover a portion  generally to  but may cover up to  of our euro based financial assets 
at december   we had no outstanding forward contracts 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately  in unrealized foreign currency gains related to our outstanding euro denominated accounts receivable balances 
both the unrealized gain on the outstanding forward contracts and the unrealized gains on outstanding euro denominated receivables were recorded in other income expense  net in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents assuming a translation of our euro denominated revenue for the year ended december  at an average euro to us dollar exchange rate of and a uniform ten percent strengthening or weakening of this exchange rate  we estimate that income before income taxes for the year ended december  would increase or decrease  respectively  by approximately  this analysis does not give effect to any forward currency foreign exchange contracts that may be used to hedge foreign currency risk 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the hypothetical gains and losses discussed above based on fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and our actual exposure and hedging transactions 
our sales to non european union countries are typically denominated in us dollars 
competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate may limit our ability to increase prices in the event of adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
sales of these products are affected by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  and in particular  the euro 
any long term strengthening of the us dollar could depress the demand for these us manufactured products  reduce sales  or cause us to reduce per unit selling prices
