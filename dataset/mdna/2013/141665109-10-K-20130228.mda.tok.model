return and refunds of title iv program funds an institution participating in title iv programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned title iv program funds that were disbursed to students who withdrew from educational programs before completing the programs  and must return those funds in a timely manner 
the portion of tuition and registration fee payments received from students but not yet earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets  as such amounts represent revenue that we expect to earn within the next year 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term or program period  we refund the portion of tuition and registration fees already paid that we are not entitled to retain  pursuant to applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards and our refund policy 
the amount of funds to be refunded on behalf of a student is calculated based upon the period of time in which the student has attended classes and the amount of tuition and registration fees paid by the student as of the student s withdrawal date 
such refunds typically result in a reduction to deferred tuition revenue and cash on our consolidated balance sheets  because generally  we do not recognize tuition revenue in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income until related refund provisions have lapsed 
institutions are required to return funds within days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn 
an institution that is found to be in non compliance with ed refund requirements for either of the last two completed fiscal years must post a letter of credit in favor of ed in an amount equal to of the total title iv program refunds that were paid or should have been paid by the institution during its prior fiscal year 
as of december   we have posted no letters of credit in favor of ed due to non compliance with ed refund requirements 
change of ownership or control when an institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control  as that term is defined by the state in which it is located  its accrediting agency and ed  it must secure the approval of those agencies to continue to operate and to continue to participate in title iv programs 
if the institution is unable to re establish state authorization and accreditation requirements and satisfy other requirements for certification by ed  the institution may lose its authority to operate and its ability to participate in title iv programs 
an institution whose change of ownership or control is approved by the appropriate authorities is nonetheless provisionally re certified by ed for a period of up to three years 
transactions or events that constitute a change of control by one or more of the applicable regulatory agencies  including ed  applicable state agencies  and accrediting bodies  include the acquisition of an institution from another entity or significant acquisition or disposition of an institution s equity 
it is possible that some of these events may occur without our control 
our failure to obtain  or a delay in obtaining  a required approval of any change in control from ed  applicable state agencies  or accrediting agencies could impair our ability or the ability of the affected schools to participate in 
table of contents title iv programs 
if we were to undergo a change of control and a material number of our schools failed to obtain the required approvals from applicable regulatory agencies in a timely manner  our student population  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
when we acquire an institution that is eligible to participate in title iv programs  that institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control as defined by ed 
each of our acquired schools in the us has undergone a certification review under our ownership and has been certified to participate in title iv programs on a provisional basis  per ed requirements  until such time that ed signs a new program participation agreement with the institution 
currently  none of our schools are subject to provisional certification status due to ed s change of ownership criteria 
the potential adverse effects of a change of control under ed regulations may influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale  purchase  transfer  issuance or redemption of our common stock 
opening new schools  start up campuses  and adding educational programs the hea generally requires that proprietary institutions be fully operational for two years before applying to participate in title iv programs 
however  an institution that is certified to participate in title iv programs may establish a start up branch campus or location and participate in title iv programs at the start up campus without reference to the two year requirement if the start up campus has received all of the necessary state and accrediting agency approvals  has been reported to ed  and meets certain other criteria as defined by ed 
nevertheless  under certain circumstances  a start up branch campus may also be required to obtain approval from ed to be able to participate in title iv programs 
in addition to ed regulations  certain of the state and accrediting agencies with jurisdiction over our schools have requirements that may affect our ability to open a new school  open a start up branch campus or location of one of our existing schools  or begin offering a new educational program at one of our schools 
if we establish a new school  add a new branch start up campus  or expand program offerings at any of our schools without obtaining the required approvals  we would likely be liable for repayment of title iv program funds provided to students at that school or branch campus or enrolled in that educational program  and we could also be subject to sanctions 
also  if we are unable to obtain the approvals from ed  applicable state regulatory agencies  and accrediting agencies for any new schools  branch campuses  or program offerings where such approvals are required  or to obtain such approvals in a timely manner  our ability to grow our business would be impaired and our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
administrative capability ed regulations specify extensive criteria that an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in title iv programs 
these criteria relate to  among other things  institutional staffing  operational standards such as procedures for disbursing and safeguarding title iv program funds  timely submission of accurate reports to ed and various other procedural matters 
if an institution fails to satisfy any of ed s criteria for administrative capability  ed may require the repayment of title iv program funds disbursed by the institution  place the institution on provisional certification status  require the institution to receive title iv program funds under another funding arrangement  impose fines or limit or terminate the participation of the institution in title iv programs 
restrictions on payment of commissions  bonuses and other incentive payments an institution participating in title iv programs cannot provide any commission  bonus  or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or title iv financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance 
many of these restrictions were the result of new regulations issued in october which became effective july  these restrictions required us to terminate certain compensation payments to our affected employees and to implement changes in contractual and other arrangements with third parties to 
table of contents change structures formerly allowed under ed rules  and therefore have had a significant impact on our ability to compensate  recruit  retain and motivate affected admissions and other affected employees as well as on our business arrangements with third party lead generators and other marketing vendors 
further  ed s laws and regulations regarding this rule do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances 
if ed determined that an institution s compensation practices violated these standards  ed could subject the institution to monetary fines  penalties or other sanctions 
substantial misrepresentation the hea prohibits an institution participating in title iv programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs  financial charges  graduate employability or its relationship with ed 
under ed s rules  a misrepresentation is any statement made in writing  visually  orally or otherwise made by the institution  any of its representatives or a third party that provides educational programs  marketing  advertising  recruiting  or admissions services to the institution  that is false  erroneous or has the likelihood or tendency to deceive  and a substantial misrepresentation is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely  or has reasonably relied  to that person s detriment 
considering the broad definition of substantial misrepresentation  it is possible that  despite our training efforts and compliance programs  our institutions employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations 
if ed determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation  ed may revoke the institution s program participation agreement  impose limitations on the institution s participation in title iv programs  deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters  or initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit  suspend  or terminate its eligibility to participate in title iv programs  the institution could also be exposed to increased risk of action under the federal false claims act 
eligibility and certification procedures under the provisions of the hea  an institution must apply to ed for continued certification to participate in title iv programs at least every six years or when it undergoes a change of control  as discussed above 
in addition  an institution must obtain ed approval for certain substantial changes in its operations  including changes in an institution s accrediting agency or state authorizing agency or changes to an institution s structure or certain basic educational features 
ed may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all required eligibility and certification standards 
provisional certification does not generally limit an institution s access to title iv program funds 
ed may withdraw an institution s provisional certification without advance notice if ed determines that the institution is not fulfilling all material requirements 
several of our institutions are currently on provisional certification briarcliffe college open ed program reviews  sanford brown college boston and le cordon bleu college of culinary arts scottsdale administrative capability  and our sanford brown institutions in atlanta  ga  boston  ma  farmington  ct  fenton  mo and mclean  va  as well as missouri college rule percentages above in fiscal

risk factors risks related to the highly regulated field in which we operate if our us schools fail to comply with the extensive federal regulatory requirements for school operations in the educational services industry  we could incur financial penalties  restrictions on our operations  loss of federal and state financial aid funding for our students  or loss of our authorization to operate our us schools 
federal regulatory requirements cover virtually all phases of the operations of our us schools  including educational program offerings  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing and recruiting  financial operations  payment of refunds to students who withdraw  financial aid to students  acquisitions or openings of new institutions  additions of new educational programs  closure or relocation of existing locations and changes in corporate structure and ownership 
ed is our primary federal regulator pursuant to the hea 
a significant portion of our us based students rely on title iv programs  and we derive a substantial portion of our revenue and cash flows from title iv programs 
for example  for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of our us based students who were in a program of study at any date during that year participated in student aid and loans under title iv programs  which resulted in title iv program cash receipts recorded by the company of approximately billion 
all of our us schools participate in title iv programs and are subject to extensive regulation by ed  various state agencies and accrediting commissions 
to participate in title iv programs  a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies  be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ed  and be certified by ed as an eligible institution 
most ed requirements are applied on an institutional basis  with an institution defined by ed as a main campus and any of its branch campuses or additional locations 
each institution is assigned an identification number known as an opeid  or office of postsecondary education identification number  with each institution s branches and other locations assigned to the institution s opeid 
the regulations  standards and policies of our regulators change frequently and are subject to interpretation  particularly where they are crafted for traditional  academic term based schools rather than our non term academic delivery model 
changes in  or new interpretations of  applicable laws  regulations or standards could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation  authorization to operate in various states  permissible activities  receipt of funds under title iv programs  or costs of doing business 
we cannot predict with certainty how all of the requirements applied by our regulators will be interpreted or whether our schools will be able to comply with these requirements in the future 
from time to time  we identify compliance deficiencies that we must address and  where appropriate  report such deficiencies to ed 
such reporting  even in regard to a minor or inadvertent compliance issue  could result in a more significant compliance review by ed or even a full recertification review  which may require the expenditure of substantial administrative time and resources to address 
if ed concluded that these reported deficiencies reflect a lack of administrative capability  we or the particular institutions could be subject to additional sanctions or even lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
findings or allegations of noncompliance may subject us to qui tam lawsuits under the federal false claims act  under which private plaintiffs seek to enforce remedies on behalf of the us and  if successful  are entitled to recover their costs and to receive a portion of any amounts recovered by the us in the lawsuit  the costs of which may be significant 
a failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability would have negative impacts on our operations 
pursuant to the title iv program regulations  each eligible higher education institution must  among other things  satisfy a quantitative standard of financial responsibility that is based on a weighted average of three 
table of contents annual tests which assess the financial condition of the institution 
these tests provide three individual scores that are converted into a single composite score 
if an institution does not achieve a sufficiently high composite score  it will be subject to additional monitoring and reporting procedures  the costs of which may be significant  being transferred from the advance method of payment of title iv program funds to cash monitoring status referred to as heightened cash monitoring  or hcm  status or to the reimbursement or heightened cash monitoring hcm methods of payment  a requirement to submit an irrevocable letter of credit to ed in an amount equal to of the title iv program funds that the institution received during its most recently completed fiscal year  or provisional certification for up to three years  depending on the level of its composite score and ed s discretion 
see item  business student financial aid and related federal regulation compliance with federal regulatory standards and effect of federal regulatory violations financial responsibility standards  for more information about the quantitative standard of financial responsibility and the alternative ways an institution may establish eligibility to continue to participate in title iv programs 
ed has significant discretion in determining the applicable monitoring and reporting procedures  the amount of any required letter of credit and the terms of any provisional certification 
all of our institutions are currently subject to hcm status see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
if any of our institutions become subject to the reimbursement or hcm methods of payment  the institution must disburse its own funds to students  document the students eligibility for title iv program funds and comply with certain waiting period requirements before receiving such funds from ed  which would result in a significant delay in receiving those funds 
the process of re establishing a regular schedule of cash receipts for the title iv program funds if ed places our schools on reimbursement or hcm payment status could take several months  and would require us to fund ongoing operations substantially out of existing cash balances 
if our existing cash balances are insufficient to sustain us through this transition period  we would need to pursue other sources of liquidity  which may not be available or may be costly 
ed applies its quantitative financial responsibility tests annually based on an institution s audited financial statements and may apply the tests if a school undergoes a change in control or under other circumstances 
ed also may apply the tests to the parent company of our schools  and to other related entities 
a composite score of at least is considered financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight 
our composite score for the consolidated entity for the year ended december  was recent profitability declines have placed downward pressure on our financial responsibility composite scores for the year ended december   and are expected to continue to do so for the year ended december  our preliminary calculation of the composite score for the consolidated entity for the year ended december  is the company continuously monitors compliance with ed s standards of financial responsibility 
to the extent the future operating results of the company decline more than is anticipated in  it may require us to seek further cost reductions  raise equity  sell assets or implement other significant changes to our business to remain compliant with the annual financial responsibility tests 
if in the future we are required to satisfy ed s standards of financial responsibility on an alternative basis  including potentially by posting irrevocable letters of credit  we may not have the capacity to post these letters of credit 
accreditor and state regulatory requirements also address financial responsibility  and these requirements vary among agencies and also are different from the ed requirements 
any developments relating to our satisfaction of ed s financial responsibility requirements may lead to additional focus or review by our accreditors or applicable state agencies regarding their respective financial responsibility requirements 
in addition to financial responsibility standards  limits may be placed on our us schools participation in title iv programs if they fail to satisfy ed s administrative capability standards that cover staffing  procedures for disbursing and safeguarding title iv program funds  reporting and other procedural matters 
if a school fails to meet these criteria  ed may require repayment of previously disbursed title iv program funds  place the school on provisional certification status  or transfer the school from ed s advance method of payment of title iv program funds to another funding arrangement  impose fines  or limit or terminate the school s participation in title iv programs 

table of contents if our schools fail to maintain financial responsibility or administrative capability  they could lose their eligibility to participate in title iv programs  have that eligibility adversely conditioned or be subject to similar negative consequences under accreditor and state regulatory requirements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in particular  limitations on  or termination of  participation in title iv programs as a result of the failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability would limit students access to title iv program funds  which would significantly reduce the enrollments and revenues of our schools eligible to participate in title iv programs and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the us congress commenced hearings and other examinations of the proprietary educational sector that have resulted in adverse publicity and could result in adverse legislation or other regulatory action 
various congressional hearings and roundtable discussions have been held  beginning in june  by the us senate committee on health  education  labor and pensions help committee and other congressional members and committees regarding various aspects of the education industry  including accreditation matters  student debt  student recruiting  student success and outcomes and other matters 
this has led to the release of various governmental reports and negative publicity about these topics and in particular student debt 
we expect this to continue 
in july  the help committee released a report analyzing information requested from companies operating proprietary schools including us and other publicly traded companies providing proprietary postsecondary education services 
the report contended that these institutions have a high cost of attendance  engage in aggressive and deceptive recruiting  have high drop out rates  provide insufficient student support services and are responsible for high levels of student debt and loan defaults  among other things  and called for increased disclosure of information about student outcomes at for profit colleges and universities  prohibiting institutions from using federal financial aid funding to market  advertise and recruit  amending the rule discussed below to prohibit these institutions from receiving more than percent of their revenues from federal funds  prohibiting the use of mandatory binding arbitration clauses in enrollment agreements and other measures ostensibly to protect students and taxpayers 
in addition  various members of congress have recently proposed legislation to  among other things remove the provision that prevents borrowers from discharging student loan debt in bankruptcy  move educational benefits for military personnel into the portion of the calculation of the rule  place more restrictions and requirements on proprietary schools in serving military personnel  and prevent the use of federal funding or military educational benefits for advertising  marketing or recruiting 
further  president obama signed an executive order on april  aimed at providing military personnel  veterans and their family members with the resources they need to make an informed choice about their education prospects and other protections 
these activities along with the more recent focus on us debt levels and deficit spending may lead to adverse legislation as part of the hea reauthorization or independently  additional new ed or other regulatory requirements  additional negative media coverage  federal or other investigations of the proprietary postsecondary education industry  or third party litigation related to information arising from these activities  which may affect our participation in title iv programs or other aspects of our business 
for example  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of dodd frank created the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb to implement various federal consumer financial laws  and granted direct supervisory authority to the cfpb over  among others  providers of private education loans as that term is defined in the truth in lending act 
dodd frank also expands existing prohibitions against unfair or deceptive practices in the federal trade commission act to prohibit abusive practices 
current authorization of the hea is due to expire at the end of the help committee report  the increased scrutiny of the for profit  postsecondary education sector and the ongoing policy differences in 
table of contents congress regarding spending levels could lead to significant regulatory changes in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the hea or otherwise  and many of these changes are likely to be adverse to postsecondary schools generally or for profit schools specifically 
if any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or terminate our participation in title iv programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible  our business could be adversely and materially impacted 
congressional or other regulatory action could also require us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our administrative costs and reduce our operating income 
ed rulemaking could materially and adversely affect our operations  business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the agencies that regulate our us schools  including ed  periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements 
these new regulations often have a significant impact on our business and require us to change our business practices and incur costs of compliance and of developing and implementing changes in operations 
for example  in october ed issued new regulations which were generally effective july  pertaining to certain aspects of the administration of the title iv programs  including  but not limited to  state authorization  gainful employment  compensation for persons and entities engaged in certain aspects of recruiting  admissions and student financial aid  determination of attendance  and definition of credit hours 
many of the new regulations focused almost exclusively on the for profit education sector 
the new regulations have adversely affected student recruitment and enrollment  resulted in changes in and the elimination of certain educational programs  and required a large number of reporting and operational changes 
the new compensation regulations required us to terminate certain compensation payments to our affected employees and to implement changes in contractual and other arrangements with third parties to change structures formerly allowed under ed rules  and therefore have had a significant impact on our ability to compensate  recruit  retain and motivate affected admissions and other affected employees as well as on our business arrangements with third party lead generators and other marketing vendors 
these changes  individually or in combination  may impact our student enrollment  persistence and retention in ways that we cannot now predict 
many aspects of the new gainful employment regulations were vacated by the us district court for the district of columbia on june  see item  business legislative action and recent ed regulatory initiatives gainful employment  for more information about the gainful employment regulations and the court s decision 
in addition  certain aspects of the state authorization  misrepresentation and incentive compensation regulations have been invalidated by court rulings 
we cannot predict whether these regulations will ultimately be upheld or altered as a result of the court decisions 
although these rules were invalidated  the rationale for the court decisions in large part related to issues with the rulemaking process  not with ed s rulemaking authority 
to the extent that the regulations are upheld on appeal or revised to retain provisions that still adversely affect the eligibility of the programs we offer  our business could be materially and adversely impacted 
further  the confirmation of ed s rulemaking authority may result in it taking even more aggressive positions in the future to curtail the growth of proprietary education 
future regulatory actions by ed or other agencies that regulate our schools are likely to occur and to have similar significant impacts on our business and costs of compliance  as has been the case with past regulatory changes 
as mentioned above  the help committee report  the increased scrutiny of the private  postsecondary education sector and the ongoing policy differences in congress regarding spending levels could lead to significant regulatory changes in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the hea  and many of these changes are likely to be adverse to postsecondary schools generally or proprietary schools specifically 
we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate combined impact of the regulatory changes which have occurred over the past few years  nor can we predict the effect of future legislative or regulatory action by federal  state or other agencies regulating our education programs or other aspects of our operations  how any 
table of contents resulting regulations will be interpreted or whether we and our schools will be able to comply with these requirements in the future 
any such actions by legislative or regulatory bodies that affect our programs and operations could have a material adverse effect on our student population  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our us schools could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenues derived from title iv programs is too high 
any of our us schools or opeids which stands for office of postsecondary education identification number may lose eligibility to participate in title iv programs if  on modified cash basis accounting  the percentage of the cash receipts derived from title iv programs for two consecutive fiscal years is greater than 
under the rule  an opeid that derives more than of its cash receipts from title iv sources for a fiscal year will be placed on provisional participation status for its next two fiscal years 
we have substantially no control over the amount of title iv student loans and grants sought by or awarded to our students 
in addition  if the opeid violates the rule and becomes ineligible to participate in title iv programs but continues to disburse title iv program funds  ed would require repayment of all title iv program funds received by it after the effective date of the loss of eligibility 
several factors have adversely affected our schools rule percentages in and  and we expect this negative impact to continue in we have implemented various measures intended to reduce the percentage of our institution s cash basis revenue attributable to title iv program funds  but they have had only limited impact to date and there is no assurance that they will be adequate to prevent our schools rule percentages from exceeding in the future 
one such measure is delaying the disbursement and subsequent receipt of title iv program funds 
during  we delayed receipt of approximately million of title iv funds to help our institutions comply with the rule for fiscal we have adjusted tuition at several of our campuses for programs that are under pressure to comply with the rule  which could adversely affect our enrollment and our cohort default rates 
the ability of our institutions to maintain rates below will depend on the impact of future changes in our enrollment mix and regulatory and other factors outside of our control  including any reduction in government assistance for military personnel  including veterans  or changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the rate calculation 
in addition  there is a lack of clarity regarding some of the technical aspects of the calculation methodology under the rule  which may lead to regulatory action or investigations by ed 
changes in  or new interpretations of  the calculation methodology or other industry practices under the rule could further significantly impact our compliance with the rule  and any review or investigation by ed involving us could require a significant amount of resources 
for our fiscal year  our preliminary review of our institutions rule percentages results in none of our opeids exceeding the limit 
for our fiscal year  six of our opeids representing campus locations had rule percentages above 
ten out of the campus locations that comprise these six opeids are in the process of a teach out previously announced in the six institutions that exceeded the rule limit in were placed on provisional certification for two years in accordance with the rule s requirements 
while ed has broad discretion to impose additional sanctions on institutions that fail the rule limit  there is only limited precedent available to predict what those additional sanctions might be  particularly in the current regulatory environment 
ed could specify a wide range of additional conditions as part of the provisional certification and the institutions continued participation in title iv programs 
these conditions may include  among other things  restrictions on the total amount of title iv program funds that may be distributed to students attending the institutions  restrictions on programmatic and geographic expansion  requirements to obtain and post letters of credit  and additional reporting requirements to include additional interim financial or enrollment reporting 
should an institution become subject to such provisional certification at the time that its program participation agreement expires  the effect on the institution s recertification or its continued eligibility to participate in title iv programs pending recertification is uncertain 
two of the six institutions on provisional certification for rule percentages above for have program participation agreements set to expire before the end of 
table of contents see item  business student financial aid and related federal regulation compliance with federal regulatory standards and effect of federal regulatory violations rule  for more information about the rule  the factors which have adversely affected our ability to comply  the measures we have implemented to improve our compliance and the opeids which are on provisional certification 
if any of our institutions lose eligibility to participate in title iv programs due to violation of the rule  such institutions operating and financial results would be materially adversely affected 
efforts to reduce the rule percentage for our institutions  especially if the percentage exceeds for a fiscal year  have and may in the future involve taking measures that involve interpretations of the rule that are without clear precedent  reduce our revenue  increase our operating expenses or any or all of the foregoing  in each case perhaps significantly 
if the rule is not changed to provide relief for proprietary institutions  we may be required to make structural changes to our business or teach out additional campuses in order to remain in compliance  which changes may materially alter the manner in which we conduct our business and materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  these required changes could make more difficult our ability to comply with other important regulatory requirements  such as the cohort default rate regulations 
our us schools could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if their student loan cohort default rates are greater than the standards set by ed 
to remain eligible to participate in title iv programs  our schools must maintain student loan cohort default rates below specified levels 
each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year ending september 
the applicable cohort default rate for each cohort has been the percentage of the students in the cohort who default on their student loans prior to the end of the following federal fiscal year  which represents a two year measuring period 
the measurement period for the cohort default rate is transitioning to three years starting with the cohort  and the three year cohort default rates for the cohort were published by ed in september if an educational institution s cohort default rate exceeds the applicable standards  it may be required to delay for days the release of the first disbursement of us federal student loan proceeds to first time borrowers  establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate  be subject to provisional certification imposing various additional requirements for participation in title iv programs or  depending on the duration or magnitude of the compliance failure  cease participation in title iv programs 
the cohort default rates of our schools have generally been increasing over the past several years  and one of our institutions  sanford brown college in mclean  va  had a three year rate in excess of the applicable standard for the cohort 
we believe this general increase in cohort default rates is due to the challenging economic climate and changes in the manner in which student loans are serviced 
all federal student loans have migrated to the federal direct loan program under which the federal government lends directly to students 
this could adversely impact loan repayment rates and our schools cohort default rates  if the federal government is less effective in promoting timely repayment of federal student loans than the private lenders were under the ffelp 
in addition  the majority of loans previously made by private lenders have been sold to ed and are now serviced by ed s preferred student loans servicers 
early indications of servicing performance imply that student repayment risk may increase as a result of the transition causing an impact to our institutions cohort default rates  which in turn could affect our institutions ability to maintain eligibility for title iv programs 
see item  business student financial aid and related federal regulation compliance with federal regulatory standards and effect of federal regulatory violations student loan default rates  for more information about cohort default rates  ed s standards and penalties applicable to the two year and three year rates as well as the related compliance transition  the change to federal servicing of student loans and the company s rates for each of its institutions 

table of contents if our student loan default rates approach applicable limits  we may be required to increase our efforts and resources dedicated to improving these default rates 
in addition  because there is a lag between the funding of a student loan and a default thereunder  many of the borrowers who are in default or at risk of default are former students with whom we may have only limited contact 
accordingly  we may not be able to effectively improve our default rates or improve them in a timely manner to meet the requirements for continued participation in title iv program funding if we experience a substantial increase in our student loan default rates 
if any of our schools were to lose eligibility to participate in title iv programs due to student loan default rates being higher than ed s thresholds and we could not arrange for adequate alternative student financing sources  we would most likely have to close those schools  which could have a material adverse effect on our student population  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
government and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews and audits or bring actions against us that could require us to refund amounts received under title iv programs or have other adverse outcomes 
government agencies  regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews and audits  bring claims or initiate litigation against us based on alleged noncompliance with  or violations of  the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to us  alleged misrepresentations and other claims 
while our compliance programs are similarly extensive and emphasize individual and organizational responsibility for compliance  as well as employing training and technological compliance controls  it is possible for one or more of our employees to engage in non compliant behavior or make statements that violate some aspect of the extensive regulations governing our schools and business 
any alleged or other purported misrepresentations or actual infractions could result in a imposition of monetary fines or penalties  b repayment of funds received under title iv or other federal programs or state financial aid programs  c restrictions on or termination of our us schools eligibility to participate in title iv or other federal programs or state financial aid programs  d limits on  or result in termination of  our us schools operations or ability to grant degrees  diplomas and certificates  e restriction or revocation of our us schools accreditations  f limitations on our ability to open new schools or offer new programs  g costly investigations  litigation or other adversarial proceedings  or h civil or criminal penalties being levied against us or our schools 
any one of these outcomes could significantly reduce enrollments and revenues of our schools or result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate  which in turn could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we may also be required to expend significant resources defending against such claims 
set forth below are current examples of reviews  audits and potential claims we are subject to 
due to their participation in title iv programs  our schools and universities are subject to periodic program reviews and audits by ed for the purpose of evaluating an institution s compliance with title iv program requirements  identifying any liabilities to ed or students caused by errors in compliance  and improving future institutional capabilities 
as previously disclosed  ed s office of inspector general audit services division commenced a compliance audit of ctu in june  covering the period july  to may   to determine whether ctu had policies and procedures to ensure that ctu administered title iv program and other federal program funds in accordance with applicable federal law and regulation 
on january   the oig issued a draft report identifying three findings  two of potential material non compliance 
the results of this audit are not yet final and may result in a liability to ed 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this audit and the potential outcome 
we have received information requests from various regulators pertaining to our historical placement determination practices and related matters  including  as previously disclosed  ed  which has advised us that it is conducting an inquiry concerning possible violations of ed misrepresentation regulations in connection with historical placement rates provided by certain of our schools to accrediting bodies  students and prospective 
table of contents students 
as also previously disclosed  in december ed moved all of our institutions from the advance method of payment of title iv program funds to cash monitoring status referred to as heightened cash monitoring  or hcm  status 
although our existing practices substantially conform to the requirements of this more restrictive method of drawing down students title iv program funds  if ed finds violations of the hea or related regulations  ed may impose monetary or program level sanctions  or transfer our schools to the reimbursement or heightened cash monitoring hcm methods of payment of title iv program funds  under which the institution must disburse its own funds to students  document the students eligibility for title iv program funds and comply with certain waiting period requirements before receiving such funds from ed  which would result in a significant delay in receiving those funds 
the process of re establishing a regular schedule of cash receipts for the title iv program funds if ed places our schools on reimbursement or hcm payment status could take several months  and would require us to fund ongoing operations substantially out of existing cash balances 
in addition  if ed determines that an eligible institution has violated its misrepresentation regulations with regard to placement rates or other disclosures to students or prospective students  ed may revoke  limit  suspend or deny the institution s title iv eligibility  or impose fines 
any failure to comply with state and regulatory requirements  or new state legislative or regulatory initiatives affecting our schools  could have a material adverse effect on our student population  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our schools are subject to extensive state level regulation and oversight by state licensing agencies  whose approval or exemption is necessary to allow an institution to operate and grant degrees or diplomas 
state laws vary from state to state  but generally establish standards for faculty qualifications  the location and nature of facilities  financial policies  new programs and student instruction  administrative staff  marketing and recruitment and other operational and administrative procedures 
any failure of one of our us schools to maintain state authorization would result in that school being unable to offer educational programs and students attending the campus being ineligible for title iv programs 
state legislatures often consider legislation affecting regulation of postsecondary educational institutions 
enactment of this legislation and ensuing regulations  or changes in interpretation of existing regulations  may impose substantial costs on our schools and require them to modify their operations in order to comply with the new regulations 
for example  in october ed issued new regulations which impose requirements on states with regard to their licensure and authorization of postsecondary institutions such as those operated by us 
states that did not currently have an approval framework that met ed requirements had to modify their authorization and licensure requirements in order for them to maintain their eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
state regulatory changes and approval and exemption processes can be lengthy and may be made more difficult and time consuming as a result of state budget challenges  increased pressures on states caused by new federal regulations and staffing shortages 
these new requirements went into effect july  and have required our schools to act quickly to a changing state regulatory landscape as they adapt to the new guidelines imposed by ed 
the october regulations also required that an institution offering distance learning or online programs secure the approval of those states which require such approval and provide evidence of such approval to ed upon request 
on july   the us district court for the district of columbia struck down those portions of the october  regulations requiring proof of state approval for online education programs and this ruling was affirmed on appeal 
ed may elect to re introduce a different form of this rule in the future 
our schools offering distance learning have already reached out to various state regulators and have completed additional applications for licensures or confirmed exemptions for their distance learning programs 
at this time  even though this specific federal requirement has been invalidated  we expect to continue processing the applications that have been submitted 
state regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent between states  change frequently and  in some instances  are not clear  and the interpretation of such regulations is generally left to the discretion of state employees or agents 
in response to the new ed rules  many states that had not previously regulated delivery of online courses and programs have enacted legislation  regulations or interpretations of existing regulations to specifically address online educational programs  such as those offered by our schools 

table of contents if we fail or are unable to comply with current or future state licensing or authorization requirements  are unable to successfully obtain new required state approvals for our schools offering online education  or determine that we are unable to cost effectively comply with new or changed state licensing or authorization requirements  we could lose enrollments  eligibility to participate in title iv programs and revenues in any affected states  which could materially affect our revenues and our growth opportunities 
if one or more of our schools fails to maintain institutional accreditation  if one or more of our accrediting agencies loses recognition by ed  or if certain of our programs cannot obtain or maintain programmatic accreditation  our student enrollments would diminish and our business would suffer 
institutional accreditation 
in the us  accrediting agencies periodically review the academic quality of an institution s instructional programs and its administrative and financial operations to ensure that the institution has the resources to perform its educational mission 
ed relies on accrediting agencies to assess whether an institution s educational programs qualify the school to participate in title iv programs 
see item  business accreditation and jurisdictional authorizations institutional accreditation and compliance monitoring by accrediting agencies 
the failure to comply with accreditation standards will subject an institution to additional oversight and reporting requirements  accreditation proceedings such as a show cause directive  an action to defer or deny action related to an institution s application for a new grant of accreditation or an action to suspend an institution s accreditation or a program s approval 
see  for example  the risk factor below regarding minimum placement rate standards 
if our schools or programs are subject to accreditation actions or are placed on probationary accreditation status  we may experience additional adverse publicity  impaired ability to attract and retain students and substantial expense to obtain unqualified accreditation status 
any final loss of institutional accreditation after exhaustion of the administrative agency processes would result in a loss of title iv program funds for the affected school and its students 
such events and any related claims brought against us could have a material adverse impact on our business  reputation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
programmatic accreditation 
many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited 
while programmatic accreditation is not a sufficient basis to qualify for institutional title iv program certification  programmatic accreditation may improve employment opportunities for program graduates in their chosen field and enable them to sit for certain required professional licensing exams 
those of our programs that do not have such programmatic accreditation  where available  or fail to maintain such accreditation  may experience adverse publicity  declining enrollments  litigation or other claims from students or suffer other materially adverse impacts  which could result in it being impractical for us to continue offering such programs 
as discussed in the risk factor below  programs at several campuses are appealing a withdrawal of accreditation or are subject to a show cause directive 
ed recognition of accrediting agencies 
our participation in title iv programs is dependent on ed continuing to recognize the accrediting agencies that accredit our colleges and universities 
the standards and practices of these agencies have become a focus of attention by ed over the last few years 
if ed ceased to recognize a particular accrediting agency for any reason  our schools that are accredited by that accrediting agency would not be eligible to participate in title iv programs beginning months after the date such recognition ceased  unless that accrediting agency was again recognized or our schools that are accredited by that accrediting agency were accredited by another accrediting body recognized by ed 
if our schools that are accredited by that accrediting agency became ineligible to participate in title iv programs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected 
our largest individual institutions are institutionally accredited by hlc  one of the six regional accrediting agencies recognized by ed 
as an example of ed s increased focus on accrediting agencies  in january of  ed staff conducted a review of hlc and developed in partnership with the agency a corrective action plan to address concerns raised by the office of inspector general  including concerns about the agency s review of 
table of contents credit hours among its member institutions 
as part of the corrective action plan  hlc was required to file interim reports with the national advisory committee on institutional quality and improvement naciqi in and effective january  hlc adopted new standards for accreditation that address  among other things  the requirements of the program integrity regulations regarding credit hour calculations 
almost all of our nationally accredited institutions are institutionally accredited by acics and several are jointly accredited by accsc and acics 
as further evidence of ed s continuing scrutiny of its recognized accreditors  at the june meeting of naciqi  acics was one of four out of seven agencies that had applied for a five year recognition  but instead received only a one year extension of their recognition  during which time the agency must demonstrate full compliance with all of ed s accreditation standards 
acics is currently scheduled to appear at the june naciqi meeting to demonstrate its compliance with ed s accreditation standards and seek a longer extension of its recognition 
the focus by the office of inspector general and ed on accrediting bodies may make the accreditation review process more challenging for all of our schools when they undergo their normal accreditation review processes in the future and we believe it is impacting the accrediting bodies decisions with respect to other requests from and reviews of the institutions they accredit 
these occurrences are likely to cause our schools to incur additional costs and or curtail or modify certain program offerings in order to maintain their accreditation  or become accredited by another accrediting body recognized by ed  which could increase our schools operational costs  reduce their enrollments and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
most of our domestic campuses are required to achieve minimum placement standards which have been difficult to achieve 
our national accreditors  some programmatic accreditors and some state licensing bodies require our domestic campuses and or programs to achieve placement rates of between and within limited time periods after students have graduated  and many of these standards have been increasing over recent years 
during this protracted period of economic slowdown and high unemployment across the us  job prospects for many college graduates  regardless of the institution they attend or the degree they have earned  have been diminished as new graduates are facing increased competition from displaced workers with  in some cases  significant work experience 
many graduates  including those who have attended our institutions  have experienced a lengthening of the time it takes to obtain their first full time  in field job after graduation 
we believe our placement rates have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by current economic conditions until there is improvement in the national and local unemployment rates and a higher rate of job growth 
the various minimum placement standards required by our accreditors and state regulators generally do not fluctuate based on economic conditions  although they may take these factors into consideration when determining how to respond to campuses or programs that fail to maintain their minimum standards 
in addition  there is a lack of clarity and uniformity in many instances regarding how a placement is defined by our accreditors and state regulators  which contributes to the difficulty and lack of certainty of being in compliance with these minimum placement standards 
achieving minimum placement standards is dependent upon internal factors as well  such as the efforts of our career services personnel  our ability to provide adequate staffing to achieve desired results  program quality and the effectiveness of our strategies to improve placement rates 
fifty five of our acics accredited campuses are subject to increased levels of accreditation oversight because they fell below acics benchmark placement or retention rate standards for the acics reporting year  of which we are in the process of teaching out 
four of these campuses are on probation by acics  three of which we are teaching out 
for the acics reporting year  the minimum acceptable placement rate compliance standard is increasing from to  and the benchmark placement rate standard is increasing from to  which is likely to make our compliance with these standards more difficult 
the company s nine accsc accredited campuses and many of our abhes accredited programs are also subject to additional 
table of contents reporting requirements relating to placement rates 
in addition  we are appealing the withdrawal of accreditation from three of our abhes accredited medical assisting programs relating to placement rate matters and three additional campuses are subject to a show cause directive 
see item  business accreditation and jurisdictional authorizations compliance monitoring by accrediting agencies employment placement rate standards and other student achievement outcomes  for more information about the requirements applicable to our schools and our compliance therewith 
failure to achieve minimum placement standards could result in a loss of accreditation or state regulatory approvals for the campus as a whole or for specific programs 
we have had to cap enrollment in or teach out certain programs due to low placement opportunities for graduates of those programs  and we expect that we will need to take these steps with respect to more programs and or campuses if we are unable to place our graduates within the time frames required by the accreditors and states that regulate our institutions 
these actions reduce our revenues and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
these actions may also reduce student interest in our programs and or campuses  which would further negatively impact our business 
we need timely approval by applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs  make substantive changes to existing programs  or expand our operations into or within certain states 
we are facing a period of extremely heightened regulatory scrutiny as discussed in other risk factors above 
we believe regulatory agencies are generally seeing significant increases in the volume of requests as a result of the industry adjusting to the significant volume of new regulations 
regulatory capacity constraints have resulted in delays to various approvals our institutions are requesting 
to open a new school or branch campus  or to establish a new educational program or substantive changes to existing programs  we are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from ed and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies  which may be conditioned  delayed or denied in a manner that could significantly affect our strategic plans and future growth 
approval by these regulatory agencies may be negatively impacted due to regulatory inquiries or reviews and any adverse publicity relating to such matters or the industry generally 
also  any adverse action taken by ed regarding its recognition of any accrediting agency that accredits our schools or programs could adversely impact our ability to open a new school or branch campus or establish new or changed educational programs 
the threat of any adverse action by ed regarding it recognition of any of our accrediting agencies may impact the timing of our accrediting agencies review and decision whether to grant approval of our various requests  in particular in areas of current focus by ed 
ed and applicable state and accrediting bodies must certify a new school or branch campus for it to be eligible to participate in title iv programs 
risks related to our business our financial performance depends on the level of student enrollment in our schools 
we have experienced reduced new student enrollments in recent periods 
the continuation of the current protracted economic slowdown and heightened unemployment could further harm our business 
diminished job prospects and heightened financial worries could continue to affect the willingness of students to incur loans to pay for postsecondary education and to pursue postsecondary education in general 
conversely  an improving economy and improving job prospects may lead prospective students to choose to work rather than to pursue postsecondary education 
our enrollments could suffer from any of these circumstances 
enrollment of students at our schools is impacted by many of the regulatory risks discussed above and business risks discussed below 
if the costs of title iv loans increase and if availability of alternate student financial aid decreases  students may decide not to enroll in a postsecondary institution  including our schools 
we could experience decreasing enrollments in our schools due to changing demographic trends in family size  overall declines in enrollment in postsecondary schools  job growth in fields unrelated to our core disciplines  immigration and visa laws  or other societal factors 

table of contents reduced enrollments at our schools  for any of the reasons mentioned or otherwise  generally reduces our profitability and is likely to have a negative impact on our business  results of operation  financial condition and cash flows  which  depending on the level of the decline  could be material 
our long term strategy and efforts to simplify the organization may not be sufficient to return us to profitability 
during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to eliminate approximately positions across our domestic campuses and campus support center 
this action was a result of further simplifying the organization through the implementation of standardized operating structures  increased efficiencies in how student support services are provided and eliminating redundancies across the organization 
we also made the decision to teach out domestic campuses  in furtherance of our strategic imperative of investing in a smaller number of ground based campuses and to focus on those locations that have the strongest likelihood of delivering strong student outcomes  operational efficiency and strength in the market 
pursuant to our long term strategy  we intend to differentiate aiu and ctu and we have developed many initiatives within our career schools to improve enrollments and business results within that business unit 
we may not be successful in achieving our strategic imperatives 
our efforts to  for example  differentiate aiu and ctu could result in declining enrollments at either or both institutions 
further  our efforts to simplify the organization and our initiatives within our career schools may not fully achieve the anticipated enrollment and business improvements  efficiencies  cost savings and student outcomes 
this could lead to continued losses within our career schools and a lack of growth in our other education groups 
if we continue to sustain significant operating losses  our cash flows and financial condition will diminish  which could lead to the need to explore alternative strategic initiatives or could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the loss of our key personnel could harm us 
our future success depends largely on the skills  efforts and motivation of our executive officers and other key personnel  as well as on our ability to attract and retain qualified managers and our schools ability to attract and retain qualified faculty members and administrators 
many leadership positions within the company were vacated over the last several years  requiring the transition of leadership roles 
this included the appointment of steven h 
lesnik as president and chief executive officer in addition to his role as chairman of the board of directors 
the board is searching for a long term ceo to replace mr 
lesnik  but the success and timing of the search is uncertain 
our failure to fill the ceo position  difficulties in integrating new officers into their roles or our loss of additional key personnel could slow implementation of key initiatives  lead to changes in or create uncertainty about our business strategies or otherwise impact management s attention to operations 
we face competition in attracting  hiring and retaining executives and key personnel who possess the skill sets and experiences that we seek 
additional cost reduction measures due to declining enrollments and the negative publicity surrounding our industry may make it difficult to attract  hire and retain qualified and experienced personnel 
in addition  key personnel may leave us and subsequently compete against us after any period they are contractually obligated not to pursue such activities 
the loss of the services of our key personnel  or our failure to attract  integrate and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
budget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could adversely affect us and our student population by reducing available financial aid 
a significant number of states in which our schools operate face budget constraints that may reduce state appropriations in a number of areas including state student financial aid  but we cannot predict the amount or timing of any such reductions 
state grant programs generally benefit our institution s compliance with the rule 
if state funding for our students decreases  our institutions compliance with the rule will be adversely affected  which could adversely impact our institutions eligibility for the title iv program 
if our 
table of contents students are unable to secure alternative sources of funding for their education  our student population could be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
increased state or federal support for public institutions and community colleges  resulting in increased competition for students  also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
if we are unable to successfully resolve pending or future litigation and regulatory and governmental inquiries involving us  or face increased regulatory actions or litigation  our financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected 
we and certain of our current and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in various lawsuits  investigations and claims covering a range of matters  including  but not limited to  violations of the federal securities laws and claims made by current and former students and employees of our schools 
these claims have included a securities class action claim captioned ross  et al 
v 
career education corporation  et al 
united states district court for the northern district of illinois claiming  among other things  that the defendants violated section b of the exchange act by making material misstatements in and omitting material information from our public disclosures concerning our schools employment placement rates and compliance with accreditation standards 
in addition  three derivative actions have been filed against some of our current and former directors and executive officers captioned bangari v 
lesnik  et al 
circuit court of cook county  chancery division  cook v 
mccullough  et al 
united states district court for the northern district of illinois and alex v 
mccullough  et al 
united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging among other things  breaches of fiduciary duty and abuse of control by the individual defendants 
these claims have also included qui tam actions filed in federal court by individual plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and the federal government alleging that we submitted false claims or statements to ed in violation of the false claims act 
qui tam actions are filed under seal  and remain under seal until the government decides whether it will intervene in the case 
if the government elects to intervene in an action  it assumes primary control of that matter  if the government elects not to intervene  individual plaintiffs may continue the litigation at their own expense on behalf of the government 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these matters 
we and our schools also are subject to and have pending audits  compliance reviews  inquiries  investigations  claims of non compliance and litigation by ed  federal and state regulatory agencies  accrediting agencies  state attorney general offices  present and former students and employees  and others that may allege violations of statutes  regulations  accreditation standards  consumer protection and other legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us or our schools 
for example  the chicago regional office of the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry pertaining to our previously reported internal investigation of student placement determination practices and related matters 
in addition  we have received subpoenas from the attorneys general of florida and new york  civil investigative demands from the illinois and massachusetts attorneys general and an investigative demand from the oregon attorney general relating to potential non compliance with applicable state laws and regulations by certain of our schools 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these and other matters 
if the results of any such audits  reviews  inquiries  investigations  claims  or actions are unfavorable to us  we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines  operational limitations  loss of federal funding  injunctions  undertakings  additional oversight and reporting  or other civil or criminal penalties 
from time to time  we have such matters pending against us or one or more of our schools 
even if we maintain compliance with applicable governmental and accrediting body regulations  increased regulatory scrutiny or adverse publicity arising from allegations of non compliance will increase our costs of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our financial results  growth rates and prospects 
for example  congressional hearings and the continuing state attorneys general investigations affecting proprietary schools may spur plaintiffs law firm or others to initiate additional litigation against us and other proprietary education providers 

table of contents we are subject to a variety of other claims and litigation that arise from time to time alleging non compliance with or violations of state or federal regulatory matters including  but not limited to  claims involving students  graduates and employees 
in the event the extensive changes in the overall federal and state regulatory construct results in additional statutory or regulatory bases for these types of matters  or other events result in more of such claims or unfavorable outcomes to such claims  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business  reputation  financial position  cash flows and results of operations for the periods in which the effects of any such matter or matters becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters and expect to continue to incur significant defense costs and other expenses in connection with them 
we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage related to these matters 
government investigations  including the pending state attorneys general investigations in which we are involved  and any related legal and administrative proceedings may result in the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings against us and or our current or former directors  officers or employees  or the imposition of significant fines  penalties or suspensions  or other remedies and sanctions 
any such costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
our credit facility and letters of credit are cash collateralized and therefore may impact our liquidity 
on december   we entered into an  revolving credit facility and borrowed the maximum amount thereunder 
the loans under the credit facility are secured by cash collateral 
cash generated by operations may continue to decrease due to lower student enrollments and operating losses and any negative decisions in regulatory proceedings or other legal actions against us may reduce existing available cash balances 
these circumstances may affect our agreements and payment terms with vendors  and certain of our vendors may require us to pay for purchases in advance or on less favorable terms or could refuse to do business with us 
when our prior credit agreement expired on october   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
effective december   we were required to provide cash that is restricted in use as security for the outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million 
we may not have the capacity to post required letters of credit we may need in the future for state licensing requirements  if we are required to satisfy ed s standards of financial responsibility on an alternative basis or for other purposes due to insufficient cash available to provide security for the letters of credit 
if cash generated by operations and existing cash balances are insufficient in the future to support our cash requirements  we would need to pursue other sources of liquidity  if available  such as additional sources of credit which may be more expensive  issuance of stock to new investors or a sale of assets 
we may be compelled to terminate programs or teach out campuses due to declining enrollments or regulatory considerations and therefore may incur costs and expenses associated with closing facilities or other exit activities 
we may face excess capacity if student enrollments continue to decrease or if we decide to terminate the offering of certain programs 
we must balance current student populations and projected changes in student population with appropriate levels of costs and investment in real estate and our online platforms in order to effectively manage capacity 
we have begun teaching out and capping enrollments in certain programs due to existing regulatory considerations such as minimum placement rate standards and the rule  as well as other factors 
we have also made the decision to teach out certain campuses after evaluating a number of factors including  but not limited to the overall performance of the campus including operating results  new student starts  placement opportunities in the local market  degree of market competition from both for profit and not for profit schools and the existing lease obligation for the campus 
most recently  we announced plans to teach out campuses as part of our strategy to simplify the organization  including the decision to invest in a smaller 
table of contents number of ground based campuses 
changes in the economy  regulatory environment or unavailability of title iv program funds may cause us to terminate additional programs or teach out additional campuses 
all of these actions may contribute to significant decreases in enrollments in our continuing programs 
closing facilities or other exit activities involve costs and expenses which can be significant  and therefore affect profitability 
for example  see note restructuring charges of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of such costs in connection with the decisions made in regarding campus closures and a reduction in work force 
actual costs and expenses involved in closing facilities or other exit activities may be higher than expected and the benefits anticipated may be less due to a number of factors including unanticipated expenses in teaching out campuses and higher than expected lease exit costs 
if we fail to effectively identify  pursue and integrate acquired schools  both in the us and outside of the us  our growth could be slowed and our profitability may be adversely affected 
acquisitions are one component of our overall long term growth 
from time to time  we engage in evaluations of  and discussions with  possible domestic and international acquisition candidates 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  acquire institutions on favorable terms  or successfully integrate or profitably operate acquired institutions 
if we use debt to finance future acquisitions or issue securities in connection with future acquisitions  such actions could dilute the holdings of our stockholders 
because an acquisition is considered a change in ownership and control of the acquired institution under applicable regulatory standards  we must obtain approval from ed  most applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies and possibly other regulatory bodies when we acquire a domestic institution 
we have in the past  and may in the future  acquire schools in international markets 
there may be difficulties and complexities associated with our expansion into international markets  and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets 
if we do not effectively address these risks  our growth and ability to compete may be impaired 
we are subject to the risks inherent in operating in foreign countries 
we operate schools outside of the us and are subject to risks inherent in having non domestic operations  including foreign statutes and regulations for employees  students and postsecondary institutions  currency exchange rate fluctuations  limits on repatriation of profits  us foreign tax treaties and taxing authority  possible economic or political instability in those countries and risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act  similar us laws applicable to our operations in foreign markets  and the united kingdom bribery act  effective july   holds american corporations responsible not only for violations committed by their united kingdom subsidiaries but also for those subsidiaries actions in other countries 
our financial performance depends  in part  on our ability to keep pace with changing market needs and technology 
increasingly  prospective employers of students who graduate from our schools demand that their new employees possess appropriate technological skills and also appropriate soft skills  such as communication  critical thinking and teamwork skills 
these skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment  so it is important for our schools educational programs to evolve in response to those economic and technological changes 
current or prospective students or the employers of our graduates may not accept expansion of our existing programs  improved program content and the development of new programs 
even if our schools are able to develop acceptable new and improved programs in a cost effective manner  our schools may not be able to begin offering them as quickly as prospective employers would like or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs 
if we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints  rapid technological changes or other factors  our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired  the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could decline  and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

table of contents if our graduates are unable to obtain professional licenses or certification in their chosen field of study  we may face declining enrollments and revenues or student claims against us 
many of our students  particularly in the healthcare programs we offer  require or desire professional licenses and certifications in order to obtain employment in their chosen fields 
many factors affect a student s ability to become licensed  including whether the student s program and institution are accredited by a particular accrediting commission or approved by a professional association or by the state in which the student seeks employment  and the student s own qualifications and attainment 
if one or more states  local governments or major employers deny licenses  certifications or employment eligibility to a significant number of our students due to factors relating to our institutions or programs  we could suffer reputational harm and declining enrollments in those institutions or programs  or face student claims or litigation that could affect our revenues and results of operations 
our future financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of non financial assets and non financial liabilities  including long lived assets  deferred tax assets  goodwill and intangible assets  such as our trade names 
in accordance with us gaap  we review our non financial assets and non financial liabilities  including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  such as our trade names  for impairment on at least an annual basis through the application of fair value based measurements 
on an interim basis  we review these assets and liabilities to determine if a triggering event had occurred that would result in it being more likely than not that the fair value would be less than the carrying amount for any of our reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach  based on discounted cash flow  and a market based approach 
to the extent the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we may be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
we determine the fair value of our trade names using a relief from royalty method which is based on the assumption that  in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset  a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to enjoy the benefits of the asset 
to the extent the fair value of the trade name is less than its carrying amount  we record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
during  we recorded goodwill and trade name impairment charges of million see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
our estimates of fair value for these are based primarily on projected future results and expected cash flows consistent with our plans to manage the underlying businesses 
to the extent known  we incorporate the risks associated with regulatory compliance into the discount rates used to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units 
however  should we encounter unexpected economic conditions or operational results or need to take additional actions not currently foreseen to comply with current and future regulations  the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our reporting units  including the estimate of future cash flows  revenue growth  and discount rates  could be negatively impacted and could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we believe that our evaluation of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance against such assets involve critical accounting estimates because they are subject to  among other things  estimates of future taxable income in the us these estimates are susceptible to change and are dependent on events that may or may not occur 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance is material to the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheets and changes in any of the assumptions utilized in this assessment could result in a reduction to our previously recorded deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet if it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset balances would not be realizable 

table of contents capacity constraints or system disruptions to our online computer networks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students 
our schools online programs intend to increase student population 
to support this growth  we will require more resources  including additional faculty  admissions  academic and financial aid personnel 
this growth may place a significant strain on the operational resources of our schools 
our schools online programs success depends  in part  on our schools ability to expand the content of their programs  develop new programs in a cost effective manner  maintain good standing with regulators and accreditors  and meet students needs in a timely manner 
new programs can be delayed due to current and future unforeseen regulatory restrictions 
furthermore  our regulators may impose additional restrictions or conditions on the manner in which we offer online courses to our students  any one of which could negatively impact our business or results of operations 
any general decline in internet use for any reason  including security or privacy concerns  cost of internet service or changes in government regulation  could result in less demand for online educational services and inhibit our planned growth in our online programs 
for our online and on ground campuses  the performance and reliability of program infrastructure is critical to their operations  reputation and ability to attract and retain students 
any computer system error or failure  significant increase in traffic on our computer networks  or any significant failure or unavailability of our computer networks  including but not limited to those as a result of natural disasters and network and telecommunications failures could materially disrupt our delivery of these programs 
our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hackers  computer viruses and other security threats 
a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 
due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks hackers may target our networks 
we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
although we continually monitor the security of our technology infrastructure  we cannot assure that these efforts will protect our computer networks against security breaches 
any interruption to our schools computer systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on our student population  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

in some instances our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third party content on class discussion boards or download third party content to personal computers 
we may incur claims or liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material 
any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and could impose a strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit 
our financial performance depends  in part  on our ability to continue to develop awareness and acceptance of our schools and programs among high school graduates and working adults in a cost effective manner 
if our schools are unable to successfully market and advertise their educational programs  our schools ability to attract and enroll prospective students in such programs could be adversely affected  and  consequently  our ability to increase revenue or maintain profitability could be impaired 
some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully marketing and advertising our schools and the programs that they offer include  but are not limited to student or employer dissatisfaction with educational programs and services  diminished access to prospective students  our failure to maintain or expand our brand names or other factors related to our marketing or advertising practices  federal trade commission or federal communications commission restrictions on 
table of contents contacting prospective students  internet  mobile phone and other advertising and marketing media  costs and effectiveness of internet  mobile phone and other advertising programs  and changing media preferences of our target audiences 
in addition  we use third party lead aggregators to help us identify potential students 
the practices of some lead aggregators have been questioned by various regulatory bodies  which could lead to changes in the quality and number of the leads provided by these lead aggregators as well as the cost thereof  which could in turn result in a reduction in the number of students we enroll 
we compete with a variety of educational institutions  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our student population and revenue could be adversely impacted 
postsecondary education is a highly fragmented and competitive field 
our schools compete with traditional public and private two year and four year colleges and universities  other proprietary schools  other online education providers  and alternatives to higher education  such as immediate employment and military service 
some public and private institutions charge lower tuition for courses of study similar to those offered by our schools due  in part  to government subsidies  government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial resources not available to proprietary institutions 
our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
we expect to experience increased competition as more colleges  universities  and other postsecondary education providers increase their online program offerings 
a march nces report projects that between and enrollments in degree granting postsecondary institutions will increase to million students 
this projected year growth rate is lower than the increase nces reported for the year period of million in to million in such a decline in the overall growth rate in the postsecondary education sector would result in increased competition for students for our programs and could impact our ability to attract and retain students and affect our ability to increase our enrollments 
an increase in competition could affect the success of our marketing efforts and enable our competitors to recruit prospective students more effectively  or cause us to reduce our tuition charges and increase spending for marketing efforts  which could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows

through our schools  we are committed to providing high quality education  enabling students to graduate and pursue rewarding career opportunities 
during  we reduced the number of strategic business units from six to four university schools  career schools  international and transitional schools 
the creation of the transitional schools business unit was a result of the decision made in the fourth quarter of to teach out a number of campuses  which are now included in our transitional schools reporting segment  along with certain additional campuses which were previously in the process of being taught out 
these campuses employ a gradual teach out process  enabling them to continue to operate while current students complete their course of study  they no longer enroll new students 
the results of operations for schools within the transitional schools segment will be reported within continuing operations for all periods presented until they complete their teach out 
as schools within transitional schools cease operations  the results of operation for all periods presented will be reflected within discontinued operations 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we completed the teach out of le cordon bleu pittsburgh 
accordingly  the results of operations for this school are now reported within discontinued operations 
all prior period results have been recast to reflect our reporting segments on a comparable basis 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the md a is intended to help investors understand the results of operations  financial condition and present business environment 
the md a is organized as follows overview consolidated results of operations 
table of contents segment results of operations summary of critical accounting policies and estimates liquidity  financial position and capital resources overview throughout  we continued to experience declining revenues and deleveraging of our operations which resulted in reporting a decline in revenue and an operating loss of million for the year ended december  the operating loss includes goodwill and asset impairment charges of million 
we believe the decline in operating performance can be attributed to a number of factors including ongoing regulatory scrutiny of the postsecondary education industry  weak economic conditions  initiatives such as the capping of enrollment in certain programs  implementation of new entrance requirements and the decision to teach out certain programs and campuses as well as lengthening of the student decision making process 
to address the decline in operating performance  we made progress in a number of key areas which we believe will position the company for a return to profitable growth in the future 
many of the actions taken in were foundational in nature  focused  on repositioning the company to be more competitive in the ever changing postsecondary education industry 
the areas of focus in  included resolving current regulatory challenges across our institutions  simplifying the organization  and creating advantage in the marketplace through differentiating our very strong education brands 
regulatory challenges in may  we received notification from acics that it acted to immediately vacate the show cause directive with respect to our past determination of placement rates applicable to all cec campuses accredited by acics 
this decision allowed our campuses to request to submit new program applications for consideration by acics 
in november  the company reported its placement rates for the acics reporting year 
as of the date of this filing  a number of campuses have varying levels of additional reporting and other actions required as a result of reporting placement rates and or retention rates below the required levels 
see item  business  for additional information 
throughout  we continued to take action towards improving the placement of our graduates 
those actions included adding additional career services personnel within our campuses 
these individuals are focused on assisting our students with finding jobs following completion of their academic program 
we continue to use the tools and outreach resources made available to career services advisors  including agreements with two career search providers  and increased interactions with local businesses in order to identify job opportunities and forge partnerships with our campuses to improve employment outcomes 
we have also placed enrollment caps on certain of our programs 
we believe these efforts will help improve the pace of placements for our graduates  however  the challenging employment environment remains 
we entered at a lower than anticipated pace in helping our students achieve job placements for the reporting year due to a transition period while the changes mentioned above were implemented 
this transition period affected our overall annual rates reported for the reporting year 
in addition  during we made changes to improve our position across certain campuses 
those changes include the introduction of pre enrollment testing  increasing tuition levels within all health education campuses  counseling students to carefully evaluate the amount of necessary title iv program borrowing  emphasizing employer paid and other direct pay education programs  and for certain programs  instituting 
table of contents program caps and discontinuations 
in addition  as of december   we had delayed the disbursement and subsequent receipt of title iv funds until the first quarter of  of approximately million for certain campuses 
as a result of our initiatives  we expect that all of our institutions will be in compliance with the rule as of december  also  to participate in title iv programs  our schools must either satisfy standards of financial responsibility prescribed by ed  or be subjected to additional oversight  required to post a letter of credit in favor of ed or placed on provision certification 
these regulations require each eligible higher education institution to  among other things  satisfy a quantitative standard of financial responsibility that is a weighted average composite score of three annual tests which assesses the financial condition of the institution 
our preliminary calculation of the composite score for the consolidated entity for the year ended december  is in the third quarter  the us department of veterans affairs concluded its review of all of the ctu campuses and assessed an aggregate potential student liability of approximately million related to this compliance review 
we had previously recorded an estimated liability of million related to this matter 
we paid million on behalf of students during the year and we believe this matter is now resolved 
in january  ctu announced that the principal accreditor of the university and its programs  hlc  acted to continue its accreditation 
the next reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled for ctu will have a comprehensive review in and was asked to provide two interim monitoring reports to hlc  which will be completed by july while we are pleased with the progress that has been made during  we remain committed to continuously improving our relations with our accrediting bodies  ed and the states in which we operate as well as to remain compliant in the execution of our mission 
teri cotton santos who joined the company as senior vice president  chief ethics and compliance officer in along with the efforts of our regulatory affairs department will lead the company s continued commitment to a culture of compliance across the organization 
simplified organization during  our simplification efforts included the continued centralization of certain functions  including admissions  financial aid and administrative support functions into our shared services organization  most notably within health education 
we continue to seek opportunities across all of our ground campuses to leverage the use of shared services where possible 
in addition  we reduced the number of strategic business units from six to four university  career schools  transitional schools and international 
under the leadership of dan hurdle  chief career schools officer  and jason friesen  chief university education officer  we will concentrate and enhance resources on academic focus  consolidate and align similar institutions and ultimately better position the company in a competitive marketplace through fewer  stronger institutional brands 
on november   we made the decision to eliminate approximately positions across our domestic campuses and campus support center 
this action is a result of further simplifying the organization through the implementation of standardized operating structures  increased efficiencies in how student support services are provided and eliminating redundancies across the organization 
as previously disclosed  we have focused on reducing costs throughout the organization in response to declining student populations throughout the year 
this workforce reduction was not only focused on ensuring our cost structure aligns with the current levels of student population  but also represents a change to the underlying operating structure of our ground campuses  most notably within our career schools 
the eliminated positions affected current employees as well as unfilled positions 
we recorded a pretax charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to these actions  which were completed in january  and are expected to result in annual savings of approximately million 
in addition  on november   we made the decision to teach out domestic campuses 
this decision furthers our strategic imperative of investing in a smaller number of ground based campuses  focusing on those 
table of contents locations that have the strongest likelihood of delivering strong student outcomes  operational efficiency and strength in the market 
these campuses  along with an additional five domestic campuses which were in the process of being taught out  comprise the transitional schools reporting segment 
the campuses were identified after careful analysis of a number of factors including operating performance  student outcomes and strategic implications 
consistent with our commitment to students  we are working with each of the campuses affected to ensure that existing students are afforded the ability to complete their course of study 
we anticipate that a majority of the campus closures will be completed by the second quarter of a portion of these campuses will have remaining lease obligations following the completion of the teach out  with the longest lease term being through the total gross remaining lease obligations for the transitional schools once they complete the close process is expected to be approximately million 
at the time each campus completes the close process  a charge will be recorded representing the net present value of the remaining lease obligation reduced by an estimated amount for sublease income 
the final amount related to each campus will be finalized at the campus closure date 
pretax asset impairment charges of million and million of pretax charges related to severance and related benefits were recorded during related to the decisions to close these campuses 
finally  in february  the company engaged a third party to help re engineer our organizational structure to align with our expected student population levels 
this project is about looking at our systems  procedures  processes and interdependencies to determine how we can become a more efficient organization better aligned with current and anticipated student enrollment levels 
as of the date of this filing  we are in the early stages of the process  but expect the outcome of the project to provide additional savings in both and beyond but more importantly to position the organizational structure in support of the company s strategic vision 
creating advantage in the marketplace through differentiating our very strong education brands as it pertains to the differentiation of our institutions  during the first quarter of  ctu rolled out its are you in brand campaign and we began utilizing a number of new marketing and admissions initiatives  including social media and viral marketing within aiu 
we have defined the addressable market segmentation for both aiu and ctu as a result of considerable market research 
we intend to provide program offerings and an overall student experience which is relevant to the student segment that each institution is addressing 
as it relates to career schools  we remain committed to reduce the number of brands by which we operate over the next few years  focusing on those brands which can be more prominently established in the marketplace and more strongly differentiated 
within our international business  we continue to increase our student offerings both through organic growth as well as with the addition of two acquisitions  luxury attitude and ecoles superieures de commerce chambery 
strategically  we remain committed to providing students with program offerings which will allow them to further advance their career aspirations 
in doing so  we are mindful to offer programs which match market demands so as to meet both internal and external standards for student outcomes and other regulatory requirements 
we have also introduced steps to improve our ability to identify students who are more likely to be interested in and ultimately successful in completing their program of study 
a part of our strategy also includes improving our ability to identify prospective students directly through our institutions websites and channels other than through our current level of reliance on lead aggregators 
our investment in the ctu branding campaign and the use of viral campaigns within aiu represent examples of actions taken in the recent past to shift how prospective students are made aware of our program offerings 
we also are working with a third party consultant to provide insights into other ways in which we can reach prospective students  assist in their decision to enroll in one of our institutions and ultimately successfully complete their respective course of study 

table of contents in addition  as previously disclosed  the company was one of several educational institutions who joined the foundation for education success 
the foundation was charged with developing and monitoring codes of conduct for the for profit postsecondary education industry 
one of the keystone codes of conduct included a day free trial period for new student starts to allow students time to assess the curriculum  faculty and learning methods without incurring any financial obligation during this trial period 
beginning in november  aiu online and ctu online rolled out the day free trial period for all new student starts 
the introduction of this free trial period exemplifies our commitment to student success by ensuring that students are ready  motivated and capable of succeeding at our universities 
we expect to roll out the day trial period at our ground campuses and career schools in the coming months  capitalizing on our experience and learnings from our online university students experience 
finally  consistent with our belief that learning is dependent upon instructional methodologies that facilitate student engagement with the instructor  with other students and with course content  whether instruction occurs within a physical or virtual classroom  we continue to invest in our methods for delivering education 
our investment in leading technology and its application to provide superior online education continues 
during the fourth quarter of we began to pilot certain strategies that focus on the concept of personalized learning which recognizes and addresses the student s individual strengths  knowledge and readiness  and adjusts the course content and timing to match these individual characteristics as the student progresses through the course 
we believe this application of technology will improve student outcomes 
our vision remains clear to be a premier  respected  large scale provider of postsecondary educational services based on leading edge technology  distinguished pedagogy  differentiated institutional offerings and superior student outcomes 
we believe these actions will provide the platform for which to return our business to its profitable growth over the long term 
however  in the near future  we continue to operate in a very challenging environment as new student demand continues to slow  new students become more hesitant to take on debt given the uncertainty in the labor market  we implement a number of program changes in response to the regulatory environment  and our industry continues to remain in the forefront of negative publicity 
all of these factors have negatively impacted our results of operations for  most notably affecting our domestic career education ground based institutions  comprised of career schools and transitional schools  which collectively reported a thirty eight percent decline in student population as compared to the prior year 
as discussed previously  our design technology and health education reporting segments  which are components of the career schools business unit  have experienced an elevated level of risk of exposure to goodwill impairment due to the current regulatory environment  reduced new student interest and changes to their business models 
during  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to these two reporting segments 
in addition  in connection with our annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets  we recorded trade name impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of  primarily related to our le cordon bleu and sanford brown trade names 
as we continue through our transformation  the transitional schools are expected to continue to report operating losses as we work with students to complete their programs of study 
we are estimating that the operating loss for transitional schools will be approximately million  excluding the impact of remaining lease obligation charges and other unusual items 
the steps we are taking to return the company to profitability are clear  however  it will take time to have a meaningful impact on our overall operating results 
as such  the company will continue to closely monitor its financial condition  including available cash flows for operations 
see liquidity  financial position  and capital resources below for a discussion of our cash balances and related liquidity considerations 
on february   we received the necessary approvals from our institutional accreditor  hlc  for the pending sale of aiu london 
pursuant to our previously signed purchase agreement  the transaction was contingent upon approval from hlc and notification to the department of education 
as we have received the necessary approval from hlc  we expect this transaction to be completed during the first half of and expect to record a pretax charge of approximately million within our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income related to this transaction 
a number of factors were considered when agreeing to this 
table of contents sale  including the enrollment trends at the campus over the last several years and the opportunity the sale would present to faculty  staff and students 
we believe this agreement provides aiu london faculty  staff and students a unique opportunity to affiliate with a dynamic british institution

table of contents year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenue the decline in revenue as compared to the prior year was a result of lower revenue across all of our domestic segments  most notably within transitional  culinary arts  health education and aiu 
this decline was driven by fewer students enrolled within our domestic institutions as of the beginning of the year and fewer new student starts across our domestic institutions in as compared to we believe our domestic institutions continue to be impacted by external factors including economic conditions  negative publicity  extended student decision making timelines and changes in regulatory requirements 
these factors  coupled with initiatives such as capping enrollment in certain programs  implementing new entrance requirements and the decision to teach out certain programs and campuses resulted in the continued decline in new student interest  causing decreases in both student population and new student starts as compared to the prior year 
international s revenue increase of million was negatively impacted by million in unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
educational services and facilities expense the decrease in educational services and facilities expense as compared to the prior year is primarily driven by lower academic costs  most notably bookstore and faculty costs as a result of lower student population across all of our domestic institutions 
we continue to closely monitor the variable costs while maintaining optimal student teacher ratios 
as a percentage of revenue  educational services and facilities expense increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to fixed costs  including occupancy costs and certain academic expenses  remaining relatively flat as compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expense the decline in general and administrative expense as compared to the prior year is mainly due to lower administrative  bad debt and admissions expenses 
the current year administrative expense includes a million insurance recovery recorded within corporate and other related to the settlement of claims under certain insurance policies 
the prior year administrative expense included million of legal costs related to various regulatory matters  which was partially offset by a million insurance recovery related to previously settled legal matters 
in addition  the current year expense includes million of severance and related costs as a result of our decision to teach out several campuses and reduce our workforce to better align with our current student population 
the prior year results included million of employee separation costs

the decline in bad debt expense is attributable to both the decline in revenue as compared to the prior year  as well as the impact of our decision in prior years to no longer offer extended payment plans to new students 
student receivables under extended payment plans have historically experienced lower repayment rates 
as of december   the consolidated amount of outstanding student receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  related to extended payment plans was million 
admissions costs decreased as compared to the prior year due to cost reductions made in response to decreasing enrollments

prior year operating income of million included million of goodwill and asset impairment charges  million of legal costs related to various regulatory matters  partially offset with a million insurance recovery related to the settlement of certain legal matters 
benefit from provision for income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate for continuing operations was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the current year tax benefit includes million of non deductible goodwill and asset impairment charges which decreased our negative effective tax rate by approximately for the year ended december  the current year effective tax rate also benefited from favorable tax adjustments related to the resolution of various state tax exposures and the expiration of the statute of limitations on other federal and state tax exposures which collectively increased our negative effective tax rate by 
our effective income tax for includes million of non deductible goodwill and asset impairment charges which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 
in addition  the effective tax rate benefited from both the conversion of a foreign operation to a disregarded entity for us tax purposes and favorable tax credit adjustments

all current and prior period financial statements include the results of operations and financial position of lcb pittsburgh as a component of discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our istituto marangoni schools in milan  paris and london for which we recorded a pretax gain of approximately million  which represents the difference between the net proceeds received and the book value of the net assets sold 
see note discontinued operations of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenue total revenue decreased from the prior year driven by decreased revenue in all operating segments  with the exception of international 
we experienced a decline in new student interest across all of our domestic institutions  resulting in a decline in new students starts of as compared to the prior year 
this decline in new student starts  as well as increased attrition rates  drove a decrease in student population as compared to the prior year  which contributed to the decline in revenue year over year 
additionally  aiu and culinary arts continued to experience lower revenue per student as compared to the prior year due to deceleration in the aiu student s pace of study and a change in degree mix of culinary arts students resulting from the business model changes that were implemented in the third quarter international s revenue increase of million was positively impacted by million in favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
educational services and facilities expense educational services and facilities expense increased as a percentage of revenue as compared to  despite a decline in revenue 
this increase is due to higher academics expense most notably with transitional schools and international 
transitional schools increase is primarily due to start up campuses increasing their 
table of contents staffing levels and decreasing student teacher ratios 
as class size declines  due to lower new student starts  the academic cost per student increases 
international s academics expense increased as compared to the prior year as a result of the increase in student population and continued investments associated with higher levels of accreditation 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower administrative and bad debt expenses 
the decline in administrative expense is driven by results including million in legal settlement costs and higher performance based compensation expense 
both and results also include employee separation costs of million and million  respectively 
admissions expense decreased due to cost reductions made in response to decreasing new student leads and enrollments 
in addition  advertising expense decreased slightly due to a change in marketing strategy and lower spending in certain marketing channels 
the decrease in bad debt expense as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the impact our previously offered extended payment plans had on our overall bad debt expense 
in the first quarter of  we ceased offering extended student payment plans to new students and our results included additional bad debt expense related to increased reserve rates applied against our outstanding student receivables under extended payment plans 
in addition  bad debt expense decreased with the overall decline in revenue as compared to the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to the capital expenditures incurred in related to our new campus support center 
in addition  amortization expense increased as compared to the prior year due to the reclassification of certain accreditation rights intangible assets from indefinite lived to definite lived and thus the recognition of amortization expense related to these intangible assets in the current year 
goodwill and asset impairment during  we recorded goodwill and asset impairment charges  which consisted primarily of million recorded within culinary arts  million recorded within health education  and million recorded within transitional schools 
these goodwill and asset impairment charges primarily resulted from our annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of included in health education s impairment charges was a million asset impairment charge for certain accreditation rights 
the goodwill and asset impairment charges for included million recorded within culinary arts related to the impairment to the le cordon bleu trade name 
in addition  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million within corporate and other related to the impairment of an investment and uncollectability of a loan receivable 
operating income operating income decreased million as compared to  primarily due to the million of goodwill and asset impairment charges recorded in the prior year operating income included million of goodwill and asset impairment charges  million of settlement expense and additional bad debt expense related to the increase in reserve rates related to our extended student payment plans 
the decline in revenues in  across all of our domestic segments  more than offset the decline in operating expenses 

table of contents provision for income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate for continuing operations was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the income tax provision includes million of non deductible goodwill and asset impairment charges which increased our effective tax rate by approximately from the prior year

lower student population at the beginning of the year  as well as lower new student starts during the current year  resulting from the continued decline in new student interest  contributed to this decline 
current year operating income for the segments decreased million as compared to the prior year driven by the declines in revenue  as well as a million increase in advertising expense within ctu  primarily related to the brand campaign launched in the first quarter of operating margins declined resulting from these factors as well as the deleveraging of operations 
the prior year operating income included a million charge related to the reimbursement of funds to the us department of veteran affairs  which was subsequently settled for million during administrative and academic expenses were lower when compared to the prior year  as cost reduction efforts related to salary and related expenses were implemented in response to the continued decline in student population 

table of contents career schools 
current year revenue decreased approximately as health education  culinary arts and design technology each experienced declines in revenue as compared to the prior year 
a variety of factors contributed to this decrease in revenue  including the decline in new student interest as a result of external factors including negative publicity  economic conditions and the changing regulatory environment  and a lower student population at the beginning of the year 
culinary arts also experienced a decrease in revenue per student due to a change in the student mix as more students participate in the certificate program versus the associate program 
the current year operating loss of million for career schools included million of goodwill and asset impairment charges of which million was recorded during the second quarter of as a result of our interim impairment test 
the remaining million related to impairments of million and million for our trade names within culinary arts and health education  respectively 
these impairment charges  combined with the declines in revenue  drove a decrease in operating margins as compared to the prior year 
the prior year operating loss of million included million of goodwill and asset impairment charges  primarily related to goodwill impairment charges of million and million within culinary arts and health education  respectively  as well as a million trade name impairment charge within culinary arts 
certain expenses  including academics and admissions expenses decreased as compared to the prior year  as we continue to reduce variable costs to correspond to the decline in student population 
the decrease in bad debt expense as compared to the prior year was a result of the decrease in revenue as well as the discontinuation in prior years of offering extended payment programs 
international 
current year revenue increased million as compared to the prior year 
revenue was negatively impacted by million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  revenue would have increased as compared to the prior year  as a result of the increased new student starts and student population 
operating income decreased million as compared to the prior year 
higher operating expenses  primarily academic and occupancy costs  drove the decrease in operating margin by approximately basis points from the prior year 
the increase in academic expense resulted from the continued investment at certain institutions within inseec group as it prepares to seek internationally recognized programmatic accreditation 
the increase in student population drove the increase in occupancy costs  as compared to the prior year  due to the expansion of facilities to accommodate the growing student population 
operating income was negatively impacted by million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
transitional schools 
this segment includes our schools that are currently being taught out 
see the campus locations table within item  business  for a listing of schools 
the decline in revenue and the increase in operating loss as compared to the prior year is a result of the decrease in both student population at the beginning of the year and new student starts during the year 
in addition  severance and fixed asset impairment charges totaling approximately million were recorded during in association with the teach out of these campuses 
we anticipate that the majority of these campus closures will be completed by the second quarter of as each campus completes the close process  a charge will be recorded representing the net present value of the remaining lease obligation  if any  reduced by an estimated amount of sublease income 
corporate and other 
this category includes unallocated costs that are incurred on behalf of the entire company 
corporate and other costs decreased million as compared to the prior year 
the current year results included an insurance recovery of million related to the settlement of claims under certain insurance policies 
the prior year included a million insurance recovery related to previously settled legal matters and a million gain on the sale of real estate  partially offset by legal expenses recorded within administrative expense 

table of contents year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  university schools 
current year revenues decreased approximately as both ctu and aiu experienced declines in revenue as compared to the prior year 
lower student population and a decrease in new student starts resulted from weakened new student interest  an increase in student attrition rates and  within aiu  a focused marketing initiative that concentrated less on new student interest leads from potential students with a lower propensity to start or persist in our programs 
in addition  within aiu  students are taking fewer credit hours during each session as compared to prior periods due to changes in curriculum structure and pacing options for our online offerings  and as a result  revenue decreased during operating income decreased by million as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in revenues more than offset the overall decreases in operating expenses as compared to the prior year 
administrative expense decreased as compared to the prior year due to a change in the organizational structure for ctu  which resulted in a reduction in headcount 
admissions expenses decreased within both aiu and ctu as compared to the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in admissions personnel 
advertising expense decreased within aiu due to a change in marketing strategy focused less on new student interest leads from potential students with a lower propensity to start or persist in our programs 
the prior year administrative expense included a charge of approximately million related to the settlements of legal matters within aiu 
career schools 
current year revenue decreased across all three reporting segments as compared to the prior year 
culinary art s decrease of was  in part  due to a change in the business model which was introduced in july whereby our culinary arts schools began offering primarily certificate programs to new students 
the certificate program generates lower revenue per student as compared to the associate program as the tuition charged for this program is lower than that of the associates program 
in addition  all three reporting segments experienced an overall decrease in new student starts  as well as an increase in student attrition rates  which drove the decline in student populations as compared to the prior year which contributed to the decline in revenue 
operating loss of million included million goodwill and asset impairment charges 
bad debt expense decreased as compared to the prior year due to our decision to cease offering extended payment plans to new students effective in the first quarter as well as an overall decline in revenue as compared to the prior year 
results included a million trade name charge for le cordon blue and a million charge within culinary arts for the settlement of a legal matter 
international 
revenue increased million  or as compared to the prior year driven by an increase in student population and new student starts  as well as a million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
operating income increased million  or as compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue was partially offset by higher operating expenses  primarily academics  as we continue our investment associated with higher levels of accreditation  as well as the support of the growing student population 
in addition  we invested additional resources for advertising as part of our marketing strategy 
operating income was favorably impacted by million due to foreign currency exchange rates 
transitional schools 
this segment includes our schools that are currently being taught out 
the operating loss of million for was a result of million of goodwill and asset impairment charges and an increase in academics expense primarily due to startup campuses increasing their staffing levels 
corporate and other 
this category includes unallocated costs that are incurred on behalf of the entire company 
corporate and other costs decreased million as compared to the prior year 
results included a million insurance recovery related to previously settled legal matters and a million gain on the sale of real estate property which were partially offset with increased legal fees related to various regulatory matters 
the prior year results included million of bad debt expense incurred from our previously terminated recourse loan program  million of lease termination charges related to our former corporate headquarters and higher compensation expense related to performance based incentive programs 

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements which includes a discussion of these and other critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue  which is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our schools  is generally segregated into two categories tuition and registration fees and other 
tuition and registration fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our schools 
generally  we bill students a one time registration fee at the beginning of their program and recognize the registration fee revenue on a straight line basis over that program period  which includes any applicable externship period 
our schools charge tuition at varying amounts  depending on the school  the type of program and specific curriculum 
a majority of our schools bill students a single charge that covers tuition and required program materials  such as textbooks and supplies  which we treat as a single accounting unit 
generally  we bill student tuition fees  including those treated as a single accounting unit  at the beginning of each academic period  and recognize the tuition fees as revenue on a straight line basis over either the academic term or program period  which includes any applicable externship period 
the tuition fees earnings method is determined by the type of program a student is enrolled in 
typically  schools that offer our culinary arts and our health programs earn tuition fees over the entire course of the program while the remainder of our schools earn tuition fees over each academic term 
the portion of tuition and registration fees payments received from students but not yet earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reported as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets  as we expect to earn these revenues within the next year 
deferred tuition revenue is stated net of outstanding student receivables on a student by student basis as of the end of the reporting period 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term or program period  we refund the portion of tuition and registration fees already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
generally  the amount to be refunded to a student is calculated based upon the period of time the student has attended classes and the amount of tuition and registration fees paid by the student as of their withdrawal date 
these refunds typically reduce deferred tuition revenue and cash on our consolidated balance sheets as we generally do not recognize tuition revenue in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income until the related refund provisions have lapsed 
the portion of deferred revenue we are entitled to retain once a student withdraws is immediately recognized as revenue with a corresponding charge to bad debt expense for any amount deemed to be uncollectible 
our schools academic year is generally at least weeks in length but varies both by school and program of study and is divided by academic terms or payment periods 
academic terms or payment periods are determined by regulatory requirements mandated by the federal government and or appropriate accrediting body  which also vary by school and program 
academic terms are determined by start dates  which also vary by school and program 
our students finance costs through a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  school payment plans  private loans and grants  private and institutional scholarships and cash payments 
other revenue consists primarily of bookstore sales for schools not using single charge billing  contract training revenue and restaurant revenue 
other revenue is billed and recognized as revenue as services are performed or goods are delivered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our schools for tuition and certain other educational costs 
based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts with respect to student receivables which we estimate will ultimately not be collectible 
as such  our results from operations only reflect the amount of revenue that is estimated to be reasonably collectible 
our standard allowance estimation methodology considers a number of factors that  based on our collections experience  we believe have an impact on our credit risk and the realizability of our student receivables 
among these factors are a student s status in school or out of school  anticipated funding source third party  internal short term and extended payment plans  whether or not an out of school student has completed his or her program of study  and our overall collections history 
out of school students include students who have withdrawn from or completed their programs of study 
all other students are classified as in school students 
we monitor our collections and write off experience to assess whether or not adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our student receivables  as noted above  or modifications to our credit standards  collection practices  and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our results from operations 
additionally  we monitor certain internal and external factors  including changes in our academic programs  as well as changes in the current economic  legislative and regulatory environments 
a one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross earned student receivables from continuing operations as of december   would have resulted in a change in pretax income from continuing operations of million during the year then ended 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs  or the ability of our students or schools to participate in title iv programs  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition  including the realizability of our receivables 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under fasb asc topic goodwill is evaluated using a two step impairment test at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit can be a strategic business unit or business within a strategic business unit 
the first step compares the book value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value  as determined by its discounted cash flows 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record 
in the second step  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results and cash flows  market assumptions and comparative market multiple methods 
determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors  such as marketplace participants  relative market share  new student interest  student retention  future expansion or contraction expectations  amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to recent historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the 
table of contents estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
in addition to cash flow estimates  our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions 
these assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in risk factors in item a on form k 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of goodwill impairment charges 
as of december   the only reporting units with remaining goodwill as of december  are ctu  aiu and international  which together had million of goodwill remaining 
the fair values of our ctu  aiu and international reporting units exceeded their carrying values by substantial amounts fair value exceeded carrying value for these reporting units by a range of to and thus  did not indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  during the year ended december   we recorded million of trade name impairment charges for several of our trade names  including le cordon bleu  sanford brown  international university of monaco and missouri college 
the decline in fair value for our domestic trade names was primarily a result of the overall decline in new student interest due to economic conditions  negative publicity regarding the industry and a decrease in market demand for certain areas of focus 
these factors are expected to negatively impact our future operating results and  as a result  the fair value calculation for these trade names declined below their respective carrying values 
in addition  the decline in fair value for our international university of monaco trade name was primarily a result of reduced online product offerings and a slower rate of local and regional market expansion than expected 
we calculate the fair value of each of our trade names in accordance with fasb asc topic fair value measurement  by utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach 
the assumptions utilized in determining fair value include utilizing projected revenue growth rates  discount rates of approximately  royalty rates ranging from to and terminal growth rates of approximately 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in deriving those estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we evaluate the merits of each significant assumption used  both individually and in the aggregate  to determine the fair value of each trade name for reasonableness 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
however  for sensitivity purposes  and with all other inputs remaining equal  a change in the royalty rates assumed in the calculation for these four trade names would result in a change in the fair value of approximately million 
a change in the discount rates utilized in the calculation for these trade names would result in a change in the fair value of approximately million 
we continue to monitor the operating results and revenue projections related to our trade names on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and trade name impairment 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
long lived assets we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
if such adverse events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
see note property and equipment of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the estimated fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or 
table of contents related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets 
see note property and equipment of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of long lived asset impairment considerations and related charges 
contingencies during the ordinary course of business  we are subject to various claims and contingencies 
in accordance with fasb asc topic contingencies  when we become aware of a claim or potential claim  we assess the likelihood of any related loss or exposure 
the probability of whether an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred  and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  is analyzed  and if the loss contingency is both probable and reasonably estimable  then we accrue for costs  including direct costs incurred  associated with the loss contingency 
if no accrual is made but the loss contingency is reasonably possible  we disclose the nature of the contingency and the related estimate of possible loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made 
for all matters that are currently being reviewed  we expense legal fees  including defense costs  as they are incurred 
loss contingencies include  but are not limited to  possible losses related to legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters  and our assessment of exposure requires subjective and judgmental assessment 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic income taxes 
topic requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the income tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
topic also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred income tax assets the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is required to be established or maintained when  based on currently available information  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
topic provides that important factors in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized are whether there has been sufficient taxable income in recent years and whether sufficient taxable income is expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets  we considered  among other things  historical levels of taxable income  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
topic further clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 

table of contents liquidity  financial position  and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  of which million was restricted and million was held by our foreign subsidiaries  including our not for profit schools 
our cash flows from operations have historically been adequate to fulfill our liquidity requirements 
we historically have financed our operating activities  organic growth and acquisitions primarily through cash generated from operations  existing cash balances and credit facility borrowings 
the recent declines in operating performance have resulted in a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
as we execute on our strategic imperatives  we expect that there will be continued pressure on our domestic operating cash flows in the short term 
we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy the cash requirements associated with  among other things  our working capital needs  capital expenditures and lease commitments through at least the next months primarily with cash generated by operations and existing cash balances 
restricted cash balances as of december  total approximately million and is comprised of million to provide securitization for borrowings under our credit agreement  million of certificates of deposit to provide securitization for the letters of credit previously covered under our expired us credit agreement and million of funds related to a legal matter 
in addition  included in cash and cash equivalents within our consolidated balance sheets are amounts related to certain of our european campuses that are operated as not for profit schools 
the cash and cash equivalents related to these schools require that the funds be utilized for these particular not for profit schools 
the amount of not for profit cash and cash equivalents was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
restrictions on these cash balances have not affected  nor do we believe will affect  our ability to fund our daily operations 
as of december  and december   our foreign subsidiaries  including our not for profit schools  held cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million and million  respectively 
we have not provided for additional us income taxes on approximately million of foreign subsidiary earnings as these earnings are considered permanently invested in those businesses as of december  such earnings could become taxable upon sale  conversion or liquidation of these non us subsidiaries  upon dividend repatriation of cash balances or upon a change in management s intent to consider these earnings permanently invested 
in connection with our sale of the istituto marangoni schools in the fourth quarter of  we repatriated approximately million during we currently have no further plans to repatriate additional cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to support our operations and continued growth plans outside the united states through funding of capital expenditures  acquisitions  operating expenses or other similar cash needs of these operations 
further  we do not currently forecast a need for these funds in the united states because the company s us operations are supported by the cash generated by its us operations 
at december   approximately million of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were held by our us operations 
currently  we would only plan on repatriating part or all of the remaining foreign cash when it would be tax efficient through the utilization of foreign tax credits  when earnings qualify as previously taxed income  upon material changes in us or foreign tax laws related to repatriation  upon divestiture of the related asset  or in the event of a material domestic capital requirement 
the discussion above reflects management s expectations regarding liquidity  however  we are not able to assess the effect of loss contingencies on future cash requirements and liquidity 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
further  as a result of the significance of the title iv program funds received by our students  we are highly dependent on these funds to operate our business 
any reduction in the level of title iv funds that our students are eligible to receive or any impact on timing or our ability to receive title iv program funds would have a significant impact on our operations and our financial condition 
see item a  risk factors 
in particular  to participate in title iv programs  our schools must either satisfy standards of financial responsibility prescribed by ed  or be subjected to additional oversight  required to post a letter of credit in favor 
table of contents of ed or placed on provisional certification 
these regulations require each eligible higher education institution to  among other things  satisfy a quantitative standard of financial responsibility that is a weighted average composite score of three annual tests which assess the financial condition of the institution 
if the institution achieves a composite score of at least  it is considered financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight 
see item  business student financial aid and related federal regulation compliance with federal regulatory standards and effect of federal regulatory violations financial responsibility standards  for more information regarding ed s standards of financial responsibility 
ed applies its quantitative financial responsibility tests annually based on an institution s audited financial statements and may apply the tests to the parent company on a consolidated basis 
our composite score for the consolidated entity for the year ended december  was recent profitability declines have placed downward pressure on our financial responsibility composite scores for the year ended december   and are expected to continue to do so for the year ended december  our preliminary calculation of the composite score for the consolidated entity for the year ended december  is the company continuously monitors compliance with ed s standards of financial responsibility 
to the extent the future operating results of the company decline more than is anticipated in  it may require us to seek further cost reductions  raise equity  sell assets or implement other significant changes to our business to remain compliant with the annual financial responsibility tests 
ed has significant discretion in determining the monitoring and reporting procedures applicable to an institution with a composite score below  the amount of any required letter of credit and the terms of any provisional certification 
if in the future we are required to satisfy ed s standards of financial responsibility on an alternative basis  including potentially by posting irrevocable letters of credit  we may not have the capacity to post these letters of credit

our students derive the ability to pay tuition costs through the use of a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  state grant programs  private loans and grants  school payment plans  private and institutional scholarships and cash payments 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our us schools cash receipts from tuition payments come from title iv program funding 
we regularly monitor compliance with the rule under the the higher education opportunity act heoa in order to minimize the risk that any of our institutions would derive more than the applicable thresholds of its revenue from title iv programs for any fiscal year 
the company has implemented several initiatives in order to assist certain of our institutions in complying with the rule  including tuition increases  counseling students to carefully evaluate the amount of necessary title iv program borrowing  emphasizing employer paid and other direct pay education programs  the use of externally funded scholarships and grants  and  for certain campuses  increasing the level of accredited non title iv programs in our schools and delayed until the first quarter of the disbursement and subsequent receipt of million of title iv funds as of december  for further discussion of title iv program funding and alternative private loan funding sources for our students  see student financial aid in item  business  of this report

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use various techniques to manage our market risk  including  from time to time  the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our municipal bond investment in auction rate securities ars has a stated term to maturity of greater than one year 
we classify our investment in ars on our consolidated balance sheets within other non current assets 
an auction can fail when the number of sellers of the security exceeds the buyers for that particular auction period 
in the event that an auction fails  the interest rate resets at a rate based on a formula determined by the individual security 
the ars for which an auction has failed continues to accrue interest and is auctioned on a set interval until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or it matures 
as of december   we have determined this investment is at risk for impairment due to the nature of the liquidity of the market over the past year 
as a result  we recorded a cumulative unrealized loss reflected within other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet of approximately million as of december  we believe this impairment is temporary  as we do not intend to sell the investment and it is unlikely we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
interest rate exposure any outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement bear annual interest at fluctuating rates as determined by the base loan rate or the london interbank offered rate libor for the relevant currency  plus the applicable rate based on the type of loan 
as of december   we had borrowings under this agreement of million 
the weighted average interest rate of borrowings under our credit agreement was as of december  our financial instruments are recorded at their fair values as of december  and we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in interest rates is not significant 
foreign currency exposure we are subject to foreign currency exchange exposures arising from current and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into us dollar balance sheet accounts 
specifically  we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the value of the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
as a percentage of total continuing operations for the year ended december   our international operations represented approximately of revenue and contributed million of operating income 
total assets of our international operations represent of total consolidated assets as of december  our current year results included an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchanges rates of million and million related to revenue and operating income  respectively  versus the prior year 
as our international operations contribute a larger percentage to our consolidated results of operations  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will increase
