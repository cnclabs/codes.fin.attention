table of contents industry the company operates in the permanently outsourced infrastructure services industry 
the company s customers are leading media and telecommunication companies and large municipalities in the wireless telecommunications  public safety  satellite television and broadband cable industries in the united states and canada 
customers in these industries have historically outsourced a significant portion of their fulfillment  engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  to provide flexibility in workforce sizing and to focus on their core competencies  thereby creating a large market for permanently outsourced infrastructure service providers such as the company 
the company believes the following trends will impact the industry faster technology upgrade cycles the evolution of technology has become more rapid  creating demand for increasingly faster and more robust voice  video and data services 
to support these next generation services  communication service providers have been investing a significant amount of capital to increase the capacity and performance of their data networks 
in addition  technologies such as long term evolution lte  distributed antenna systems das and worldwide interoperability for microwave access are being developed to support the proliferation of increasingly data intensive mobile devices such as smart phones  laptops and tablets 
similarly  broadband cable and satellite television companies continue to develop differentiating technologies supporting services such as high definition television  digital video recorders and video on demand  all of which require enhanced data transfer capabilities 
providers of these services have historically outsourced the design  construction and maintenance of their networks to third parties in order to minimize their fixed costs and number of employees 
as these providers roll out new technologies and capabilities  the company believes the demand for permanently outsourced infrastructure services will increase 
to achieve a high performance standard  the company has developed a harmonized set of technology enabled  real time monitoring and reporting capabilities  which the company refers to as its premium real time operating system  or pros 
the company relies on pros to provide detailed  real time reports on various performance metrics 
the company believes this enables management to respond rapidly to optimize operational performance and achieve operational excellence 
vendor consolidation broadband cable service providers and other telecommunication companies are consolidating their vendor bases in order to benefit from the accountability  scale and higher performance standards that a smaller number of fully integrated service partners can provide 
the company believes that this trend  although at differing stages among its customers  will provide the company opportunities for substantive growth  even if the end user market for its customers services is or becomes saturated 
the company expects that its investments in technology and infrastructure and its ability to scale its operations will position it as a logical partner for its customers as this trend continues  as well as an attractive alternative for other telecommunication companies that are searching for better performing service partners

the company believes that the opportunity for growth is significant  with the telecommunications industries constantly releasing upgrades and new products 
these network upgrades require increased design  construction  maintenance and repair services  a substantial portion of which the company expects will be provided by permanently outsourced infrastructure service providers 
public safety industry trends the company believes that growth in the deployment of networks and infrastructure for public safety and municipal wireless systems is being driven by  among other things  security and safety concerns arising from terrorism threats  natural disasters and other emergencies  and the critical interoperability needs of first responders and other responsible parties 
the substantive growth in this market is being driven by both small municipal projects and large comprehensive projects 
small municipal projects can encompass any of a number of improvements in the areas of dispatch  radio or wireless infrastructure and can range between million to million

these vendors have also trended toward focusing efforts on content management and have correspondingly grown their demand for outsourced services 
we continue to pursue differentiation from our competition through exceptional customer service levels and a superior end user customer experience 
we are focused on developing our installation base in urban areas where greater efficiencies through customer density can be developed 
in addition  we believe that downstream demand from other communications providers  such as internet service providers and telecommunications resellers  which utilize backhaul infrastructure to provide their services  will continue to increase 
as demand for these services increases  communication service providers will need to invest capital to improve their networks to accommodate the demand for increased capacity and increased service offerings  which we expect should in turn increase the demand for our fulfillment and maintenance services

we believe the opportunity for growth within our wireless business continues to be significant as the telecommunications industry continues to augment network capacity for continued data demand growth related to the proliferation of mobile devices and the increased product and services offerings for these devices 
the increase in data usage will also drive small cell and das deployment across dense user areas  additionally increasing demand for our design and engineering expertise 
as the wireless carriers invest additional capital to upgrade or enhance their existing networks  we expect additional opportunities to provide site acquisition  engineering and construction services 
furthermore  as we continue to grow and expand our presence in the wireless business  we believe that we will have new opportunities to provide ongoing maintenance services  as well as optimization services to further improve network quality and increase spectrum efficiency for the wireless carriers

table of contents item a 
risk factors the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k  should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us 
although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business  there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our future performance or financial condition 
in addition  more detailed information regarding various risks and uncertainties facing us are included under items and of this annual report on form k 
solely for purposes of the risk factors in this item a  the terms company  we  our  and us refer to unitek global services  inc and its subsidiaries risks related to investing in our common stock and to our business our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 
as of december   our total indebtedness  including capital lease obligations  was approximately million 
this amount has increased to approximately million as of august   including amounts borrowed to cash collateralize letters of credit 
our current debt also bears interest at rates significantly higher than historical periods 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders 
it will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
in addition  it could increase our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  prevent us to engage in acquisitions  internal expansion efforts or other strategic and business development initiatives  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  and make us more vulnerable to a general economic downturn than a company that is less leveraged 
an event of default under either of our credit facilities could result in  among other things  the acceleration and demand for payment of all the principal and interest due and the foreclosure on the collateral 
as a result of such a default or action against collateral  we could be forced to enter into bankruptcy proceedings  which may result in a partial or complete loss of your investment 
our debt agreements contain financial covenants that may be difficult to satisfy 
we have entered into new debt agreements that contain financial covenants requiring us to satisfy certain levels of earnings  ratios concerning earnings compared to total debt and limitations on total allowable debt 
satisfying such covenants may be difficult if our operations do not generate sufficient cash and earnings 
if we do not satisfy the covenants  it would result in an event of default and we may not be able to cure the default  which could have substantial adverse impacts on us  including without limitation the acceleration by our lenders of their indebtedness 
we have had a history of losses 
we experienced net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we cannot predict if we will ever achieve profitability  and if we do  be able to sustain such profitability 
further  we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons  including due to the other risks described in this form k  and we may encounter unforeseen expenses  difficulties  complications and delays and other unknown events 
accordingly  we may not ever be able to achieve profitability 
our past failure to file reports on form k and form q in a timely manner will result in our ineligibility to register securities on form s as a result of our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  and our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended march  and june   we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the exchange act  as amended  for a period of twelve months and any portion of a month from the due date of the last untimely report 
the need to use other forms  such as form s  to register our securities could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to raise capital  and could render our use of our securities to complete acquisitions less attractive to potential sellers 
accordingly  our ability to raise additional capital and to grow through acquisitions may be limited 

table of contents we will have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenses relating to the audit committee investigation for lawyers  investigators and interim financial staff and may continue to have increased exposure to contingent liabilities because of historical improper accounting practices identified by our audit committee investigation 
as described in the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item  and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  our audit committee conducted an investigation into the improper recognition of revenue using percentage of completion accounting with the assistance of independent legal counsel and other independent professional staff 
certain senior executives were terminated and we have had to rely on consultants to supplement our financial staff 
to date  we have incurred over million on such expenses including incremental audit fees 
in addition  our expenses for legal counsel are expected to increase due to recent litigation relating to disclosure made by us regarding our improper accounting practices on april  we also reported to the sec the results of the audit committee investigation 
we may be subject to enforcement actions as a result of such events  which may impact us adversely 
we may also be the subject of other regulatory or enforcement actions 
no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from any litigation  regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions 
the conduct of the investigation has been  and the resolution of any such matters may be time consuming  expensive  and may distract management from the conduct of our business 
furthermore  if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation  regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in an individual quarter or annual period 
our stock may no longer trade on the nasdaq stock market which may limit the liquidity of our common stock 
on april   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market stating that we were not in compliance with the continued listing requirements of nasdaq listing rules because we did not timely file our annual report on form k for the year ended december  nasdaq subsequently granted the company an october  deadline for the filing of the form k and other reports 
we have received similar notices with respect to our failure to file our quarterly reports on form q for the fiscal quarters ended march  and june  we cannot guarantee that we will become compliant before the deadline 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq stock market  investors may experience a reduced ability to sell shares of our common stock that they hold or purchase shares 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers and  if our relationships with such customers were harmed  it is unlikely that we could continue in business 
during the year ended december   our three largest customers as a percentage of revenues were directv  at t and comcast 
our contracts with our major customers give our customers the right to either terminate their contract  or reduce the amount of work that we will perform under their contract  on relatively short notice  with or without cause 
during fiscal  we received a letter from directv providing day notice of the termination of its master services agreement with us 
directv agreed to withdraw the notice of termination upon our satisfaction of certain conditions and  following satisfaction of these conditions in july  directv withdrew its notice of termination 
at t has reduced the amount of work that we will be performing  the impact of which is expected to be approximately million in revenue 
if these or other customers terminate their contracts with us or reduce the amount of work that we will perform under the contract  it could materially reduce our operating results 
we believe that we will continue to be at risk because a limited number of customers will continue to be the source of a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
a key factor in maintaining relationships with such customers is performance on individual contracts and the strength of our professional reputation 
to the extent that our performance does not meet customer expectations  or our reputation or relationships with one or more key customers are impaired due to another reason  we may lose future business with such customers  and as a result  our ability to generate income would be adversely impacted 
our construction and construction related contracts  and the accounting for those contracts  depend upon significant judgments and estimates that may differ from actual results in future periods 
the pricing of our construction and construction related contracts is established  in part  based on cost and scheduling estimates 
such estimates  in turn  are based on a number of other assumptions  including future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  prices of equipment and materials and other variables 
these assumptions can be difficult to ascertain because of the wide fluctuation in prices for equipment  fuel and other costs associated with our services 
if pricing or cost estimates prove to be incorrect  we may incur cost overruns and incur losses on contracts which would reduce our profitability 
our accounting for those contracts relies heavily upon those same estimates and judgments  as well other judgments and estimates  including estimates of progress toward completion  judgments about whether we can recover costs related to change orders from our customers  and estimates of the fair value of non construction related products or services that may be bundled into a construction contract 
if our accounting estimates ultimately prove to be incorrect  our profitability could be more volatile during the contract period or be reduced  or both 

table of contents we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  because management estimates  by their nature  involve judgment regarding future uncertainties  actual results may differ from those estimates if conditions change or if the assumptions used in making these estimates ultimately prove to be incorrect 
as described in the explanatory note appearing at the beginning of this form k  certain of our estimates related to revenue recognition were identified as containing errors as part of our restatement and materially reduced our results of operations 
our results of operations could be materially reduced again if future changes in our estimates and judgments are required 
our disclosure controls and procedures were determined to be deficient as of december   due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our inability to timely file periodic reports with the sec 
these material weaknesses result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected 
the sarbanes oxley act of and sec rules require that management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures 
among other things  management must conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
based on our management s assessment  we believe that  as of december   our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective 
the specific material weaknesses are described in item a of this form k management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to remediate these material weaknesses will be successful or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial report will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in additional material weaknesses  or could result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
these misstatements could result in a restatement of our financial statements  cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  leading to a decline in our stock price 
for more information relating to our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures  and remediation efforts undertaken by us  see part iii  item a of this form k 
we may incur goodwill and other intangible impairment charges which could reduce our profitability 
the profitability of individual reporting units or other assets may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues within a limited number of customers  and the level of overall economic activity 
during times of economic slowdown  our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than our company as a whole 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of our reporting units could decline resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
we review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that their carrying amount may not exceed their fair value 
we review other long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
should any of these tests result in an impairment  we could recognize a charge that would materially reduce our results of operations 
during the third quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell the net assets of our wireline telecommunications business unit the wireline group which resulted in the performance of interim tests of impairment 
as a result of those tests  we impaired property and equipment by million and goodwill by million 
we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of september   the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter 
when we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  we determined that the fair value of the wireless reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
accordingly  we performed the second step in the analysis and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its implied fair value  and we recognized an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
in the fourth quarter of  the carrying value of goodwill for the wireless reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value and we recorded a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million 

table of contents if we are unable to close out our projects  we are unable to bill our customers 
our business requires us to expend substantial amounts of money on a project prior to being paid by our customers 
in order to receive payment  we are required to comply with a close out process which can be time consuming and complex 
if we are unable to timely close out our projects  we are unable to bill our customers for costs that have already been expended  which negatively impacts our liquidity situation 
if we are unable to recruit and retain key managers and employees  our business may be adversely affected 
as a result of the audit committee investigation  a number of senior executives were terminated 
in addition  certain corporate staff members have left our company because of the uncertainty caused by the audit committee investigation 
as a result  we have had to rely on a number of consultants for corporate positions 
we depend on the senior management of our subsidiaries  the loss of any of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy 
although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers  we cannot guarantee that any key management personnel will remain employed by us 
in addition  the services we deliver to our customers could be delayed or interrupted if we are unable to attract  train and retain highly skilled employees or subcontractors  particularly fulfillment installation and wireless technicians 
competition for these technicians is intense 
because of the complex and technical nature of some of our services  any failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially harm our business 
we maintain a workforce based upon current and anticipated workloads 
if we do not receive future contract awards or if these awards are delayed  we may incur significant costs in adjusting our workforce demands 
our estimates of future performance depend on  among other matters  whether and when we will receive certain new contract awards 
while our estimates are based upon good faith judgment  they can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information 
in the case of larger projects  where timing is often uncertain  it is particularly difficult to project whether and when we will receive a contract award 
the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching workforce size with contractual needs 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we could incur significant costs resulting from retaining more staff than is necessary or redundancy of facilities 
similarly  if we underestimate the workforce necessary for a contract  we may not perform at the level expected by the customer and harm our reputation 
each of these may negatively impact our operating performance and financial results 
if we are unable to meet our customer s billing requirements  or if our customers delay or default on their payments to us  we may be unable to cover our expenditures related to those projects 
because of the nature of some of our contracts  we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from our customers in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment or obtain advances from our line of credit 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project or projects to which we have devoted significant resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations and negatively impact the financial covenants with our lenders 
our estimated future revenue is subject to reduction and potential cancellation 
our estimated future revenue consists of uncompleted portions of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other contracts  which in most cases can be terminated or cancelled on short notice  with or without cause 
we include in our estimate of future revenue the amount of services projected to be performed based on our historical experience with customers and our experience in procurements of this type 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
our estimates of future revenue and a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate 
if our estimated future revenue is significantly inaccurate  this could adversely affect our financial results and the price of our common stock 

table of contents provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and  as a result  depress the trading price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  or charter  and our amended and restated bylaws  or bylaws  contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings and 
provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt  or to alter or repeal our bylaws 
in addition  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  or dgcl  which  subject to some exceptions  prohibits business combinations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder  which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of or more of a delaware corporation s voting stock  for a three year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
section could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 
these anti takeover defenses could discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those you desire 
if our customers perform more tasks themselves  our business will suffer 
our success also depends upon the continued trend by our customers to outsource their network design  deployment  project management and fulfillment service needs 
if this trend does not continue or is reversed and telecommunication service providers and network equipment vendors elect to perform more of these tasks themselves or provide kits for their customers to self install  our operating results may be adversely affected due to the decline in the demand for our services 
the nature of our construction businesses exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes that may negatively affect our results of operations 
we engage in construction activities  including engineering and oversight of engineering firms 
design  construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties 
any liability in excess of insurance limits at locations constructed by us could result in significant liability claims against us  which claims may negatively affect our results of operations 
in addition  if there is a customer dispute regarding performance of project services  the customer may decide to delay or withhold payment to us 
if we are ultimately unable to collect on these payments  our results of operations would be negatively impacted 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results relating to our ability to generate additional revenue and manage expenditures and other factors  some of which are outside of our control  which could cause rapid declines in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have varied considerably in the past  and may continue to do so  due to a number of factors 
many of these factors are outside of our control and include  without limitation  the following our ability to attract new customers  retain existing customers and increase sales to such customers  the commencement  progress  completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter  the cyclical nature of the telecommunications industry  the cost of raw materials we require for our projects  and satellite television  broadband cable and wireless telecommunications market conditions and economic conditions generally 
due to these factors and others  our results for a particular quarter  and therefore  our combined results for the affected year  may not meet the expectations of investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 

table of contents legal proceedings and other claims could reduce our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
there has been a consolidated class action law suit filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against us and certain of our current and former officers entitled in re unitek global services  inc securities litigation  civil action no 
the case alleges that we made misstatements and omissions regarding our business  our financial condition and our internal controls and systems in violation of the sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule b thereunder 
we also reported to the sec the results of the audit committee investigation 
we may be subject to enforcement actions as a result of such events  which may impact us adversely 
in addition  we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these actions may seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  workers compensation  employment discrimination  wage and hour disputes  breach of contract  property damage  consequential and punitive damages  civil penalties  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
in addition  we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide 
claimants may seek large damage awards 
if not covered by insurance  defending claims against us can involve significant legal costs 
when appropriate  we establish reserves for litigation and claims that we believe to be adequate in light of current information  legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage  and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to developments 
if reserves are inadequate  insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable  or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure  we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity 
an adverse determination on any such claim or lawsuit could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
separately  claims and lawsuits alleging wrongdoing or negligence by us may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
we maintain high deductible liability insurance policies  which exposes us to a substantial portion of the costs of claims and lawsuits 
we maintain high deductible insurance policies for workers compensation  general liability  automobile  medical and dental claims 
because most claims against us do not exceed our deductibles  we are effectively self insured for substantially all claims 
we establish insurance reserves for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
our insurance reserves incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we update our estimates and the appropriateness of our reserves quarterly based upon known facts  historical trends and our judgments regarding future claims 
insurance claims may take several years to completely settle 
consequently  actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims 
a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim  including the length of time the claim remains open  trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation 
furthermore  claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections 
we believe that our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations and liquidity 
we may not be allowed to renew our casualty insurance coverage after september  on satisfactory terms 
our casualty insurance coverage expires on september  if our financial position worsens  we may not be able to obtain a policy that will provide coverage after october  on substantially similar terms as the current policy 
if we need to access the secondary market for such insurance  it may result in a significant increase in premiums or usage of liquidity 
government regulations may adversely affect our business 
our customers are subject to various regulations of the fcc and other international regulations 
these regulations require that networks meet certain radio frequency emission standards and not cause interference to other services  and in some cases accept interference from other services 
fcc regulations could cause our customers to slow down or delay development and deployment plans for network build outs  which could impact our financial results 

table of contents significant shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will increase our operating expenses and therefore adversely affect our results of operations 
the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable  and can fluctuate significantly based on international  political and economic circumstances  as well as other factors outside our control  such as actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  regional production patterns  weather conditions and environmental concerns 
recently  the costs of gasoline  diesel fuel and other petroleum based fuel products have been volatile 
we purchase fuel to run our fleet of trucks and equipment used in our operations  and as fuel prices increase  our operating expenses increase 
we may implement a fuel surcharge program or receive additional fuel charge concessions from our customers designed to offset increased fuel expenses  however  these are not guaranteed and may not fully offset the increased costs associated with rising fuel prices 
we do not currently engage in fuel hedging transactions or purchase gasoline or fuel future contracts in an effort to mitigate the risk of future fuel price increases 
while we may in the future initiate such programs  there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so or that any such programs will be successful 
increases in our insurance premiums or collateral requirements  such as construction bonds or letters of credit  could significantly reduce our profitability  liquidity and availability under our credit facilities 
because of factors such as increases in claims  projected significant increases in medical costs and wages  lost compensation and reductions in coverage  insurance carriers may be unwilling to continue to provide us with our current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations 
an increase in premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability and liquidity as well as reduce availability under our credit facilities 
our operating results can be negatively affected by weather conditions 
we perform most of our services outdoors 
adverse weather conditions may affect productivity in performing services or may temporarily prevent us from performing services for our customers 
the effect of weather delays on projects that are under fixed price arrangements may be greater if we are unable to adjust the project schedule for such delays 
a reduction in productivity in any given period or our inability to meet guaranteed schedules may adversely affect the profitability of our projects 
risks related to our industry changes in technology or consumer preferences and demand could weraken our competitiveness in the marketplace we are dependent upon meeting the demands of our customers and the public 
new technologies are rapidly being developed to enhance the public s entertainment experience 
there can be no assurance that our major customers products will continue to be popular or if our major customers adopt new technologies  that we will will have the skill set to be able to deploy such technologies 
competition in the industries we serve could reduce our market share and impact operating results 
we serve markets that are competitive and highly fragmented and in which a large number of multinational companies compete for large  national projects  and an even greater number of small  local businesses compete for smaller  one time projects 
many of our competitors are well established and have larger and better developed networks and systems  longer standing relationships with customers and suppliers  greater name recognition and greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
these competitors can often subsidize competing services with revenues from other sources and may be able to offer their services at lower prices 
these or other competitors may also reduce the prices of their services significantly or may offer backhaul connectivity with other services  which could make their services more attractive to customers 
competition may place downward pressure on contract prices and profit margins 
intense competition is expected to continue in these markets and  if we are unable to meet these competitive challenges  we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our operating performance and financial results 
we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the telecommunications industry and  specifically  the capital expenditures of the major telecommunications providers 
the demand for our outsourced infrastructure services is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering  procurement  construction and management needs 
the wireless telecommunications market  which is one of the industries in which we compete  is particularly cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the telecommunications industry 
during times of economic slowdown  some of our customers reduce their capital expenditures 
further  customers  primarily in our wireless communications subsidiaries  sometimes defer or cancel pending projects 
as a result  demand for our services may decline during periods of economic downturns and could adversely affect our operations and financial performance
