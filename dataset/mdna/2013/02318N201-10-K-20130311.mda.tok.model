table of contents part i item business ambient corporation is a leading provider of smart grid communications technology for utilities 
our innovative platform enables utilities to deploy and integrate multiple smart grid applications and technologies  in parallel on a single communications infrastructure  supporting smart metering  distribution automation  distribution management  demand response  distributed generation and more 
the term smart grid refers to the use of advanced technologies to upgrade the electric power grid  or the grid  effectively making the grid more intelligent and efficient 
the grid was largely designed and built decades ago to reliably distribute electricity from generators to customers in a manner resulting in sizable capital investments and operating costs 
a number of factors are increasingly straining the grid  including growing electricity demand  two way power flow requirements  the implementation of renewable and distributed energy sources and advanced pricing plans 
as such  the aging grid is prone to reliability  security  availability and power quality issues  costing utilities and consumers billions of dollars each year 
technology is now revolutionizing the grid and transforming it into an efficient  communicating energy service platform 
we believe that the smart grid will address the current shortcomings of the grid and deliver significant benefits to utilities and consumers of energy  including reduced costs  increased power reliability and quality  accommodation of renewable energy technologies  consumer empowerment over energy consumption and a platform for continued integration of new technologies 
the ambient smart grid communications and applications platform  which includes hardware  software and firmware  enables utilities to effectively manage smart grid applications 
our communications platform provides utilities with a secure  two way  flexible and open internet protocol  or ip  architecture that efficiently networks smart grid applications and different technologies within each application and supports multiple communications technologies currently used by utilities  such as wi fi  radio frequency rf  cellular technologies  power line communications plc  serial and ethernet 
we believe that the ambient smart grid communications platform delivers significant benefits to utilities  including support of a single network  an open  scalable and interoperable platform  preservation of utility investments  third party application hosting  remote and distributed intelligence  secure communications  and reduced overall implementation and operating costs 
the ambient smart grid products and services include communications nodes  a network management system  ambientnms  integrated applications  and maintenance and consulting services 
the communications nodes are physical boxes that contain the hardware and software needed for communications and data collection in support of smart grid assets 
we have configured our communications nodes to act as individual data processors and collectors that receive signals from other networked devices  enabling smart grid applications 
duke energy  our marquee customer  has deployed to date approximately  of our communications nodes that receive data from smart electric and gas meters  using a variety of communications technologies  and process and transmit these data to the utility back office over a cellular carrier network for further processing 
furthermore  our communications nodes  in the fourth generation of development  also accommodate integrated applications that include our own developed technology and third party technology  thereby substantially increasing their functionality 
by enabling such system interoperability  our communications platform both reduces implementation and ongoing communications costs and improves overall power management efficiencies 
we believe that  to date  no other single solution or technology has provided the necessary flexibility in a cost effective manner  enabling a comprehensive digital communications platform while leveraging standards based technologies 
we developed our communications platform to fill this void 
our long standing relationship with duke energy  which we believe has one of the most forward looking smart grid initiatives in north america  has been the source of substantially all of our revenue since we entered into a long term agreement in september with duke energy to supply the utility with our ambient smart grid communications platform and license our ambientnms through furthermore  we also intend to leverage our success with the duke energy to secure additional customers in the global utility market place 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in june  our common stock currently trades on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol ambt 
industry overview the electric power distribution grid the grid was largely designed and built decades ago  and is increasingly becoming strained 
much of the current grid infrastructure  both in the united states and abroad  is over years old and simply is not designed to accommodate the dynamic electricity distribution requirements of today or the future 
as a result  the aging grid is prone to reliability  security  availability and power quality issues  costing utilities and consumers billions of dollars each year 

table of contents the smart grid we believe that grid modernization will address the shortcomings of the current grid as well as deliver significant benefits to utilities and consumers of energy 
the smart grid encompasses multiple technologies and applications  and represents significantly more than just smart electric meters 
the us energy independence and security act of provided the following  thorough definition of the smart grid the term smart grid refers to a modernization of the electricity delivery system so it monitors  protects and automatically optimizes the operation of its interconnected elements from the central and distributed generator through the high voltage network and distribution system  to industrial users and building automation systems  to energy storage installations and to end use consumers and their thermostats  electric vehicles  appliances and other household devices 
the smart grid will be characterized by a two way flow of electricity and information to create an automated  widely distributed energy delivery network 
it incorporates into the grid the benefits of distributed computing and communications to deliver real time information and enable the near instantaneous balance of supply and demand at the device level 
in brief  the term smart grid refers to the use of advanced communications technologies and modern computing capabilities to upgrade and modernize the electric power grid and even other utility infrastructures  such as gas and water  effectively making the grid more intelligent and efficient 
we believe that the implementation of intelligent and seamless communication across the grid represents the largest expected wave of information technology spending  similar to the previous telecommunications and internet investment cycles 
smart grid applications the smart grid will connect millions of devices that generate  distribute  control  monitor and use energy  thereby enabling utilities and consumers to dynamically interact with the energy supply chain 
the smart grid is more than just smart meters  and we believe that fully realizing the benefits of the smart grid will require the implementation of a variety of technologies and applications 
for all smart grid applications to work seamlessly together  a flexible and open communications platform is needed for the interoperability of each connected smart grid application  including the following smart meters 
smart meters encompass the meters themselves  related communications equipment and data management systems that record and monitor real time energy consumption information at regular intervals 
smart meters allow for two way communication of data between the smart meter and a utility s back office  providing utilities with valuable information to measure and control production  transmission and distribution more efficiently and providing consumers with information to make informed choices regarding energy consumption 
this technology further enables a utility to reduce the costs of operating its distribution system by automating various functions that are currently performed manually  such as reading customer meters and turning power on and off at the customer meter 
distribution automation 
distribution automation encompasses utilities deploying control devices and communications infrastructure to monitor and control energy distribution in real time  enabling intelligent control over grid functions at the distribution level 
utilities use distribution automation applications to directly control the flow of electricity from individual substations to consumers in order to improve the quality of power generation  reduce the frequency  duration and scale of power outages  reduce energy losses and ultimately optimize operating efficiency and reliability of the grid 
demand response 
demand response is an initiative in which utilities provide incentives to consumers to reduce energy usage during times of peak demand 
demand response includes technology that can manage the consumption of electricity in conjunction with supply and demand fluctuations  enabling variable pricing and providing information to encourage consumers to make more active decisions about their energy usage 
utilities can use demand response to enable consumers to reduce  or provide direct utility control of  electricity use  particularly during high price demand periods  by sending time differentiated prices to customers via the meter and recording customers actual real time usage 
demand response technology enables utilities to better manage their distribution network  delivering electricity more efficiently and potentially reducing peak and baseload generation requirements 
network management systems 
utilities require back office software and computer hardware systems to monitor and manage the vast numbers of devices and information collected by those devices from various smart grid applications 
network management systems control smart grid devices and collect and process data in the back office relying on two way communications 
our solution ambient smart grid communications and applications nodes 
communications nodes are physical boxes that contain the hardware and software needed for communications and data collection in support of grid assets 
we configured our communications nodes to act as individual data processors and collectors that receive signals from other networked devices  enabling smart grid applications 
our communications nodes can also contain our own or third party embedded applications 
we are currently in the final testing and evaluation of our fourth generation communications nodes 
the following is a graphical depiction of how our communications nodes interact and connect with smart grid applications and a utility

ambientnms is a network management system that manages large numbers of communications nodes  devices and customers on a network 
a utility can use the ambientnms to effectively manage its entire grid distribution system  providing valuable information over a single communications network 
we customize ambientnms  providing a utility with the tools necessary to tailor its monitoring and processing and to act upon vast amounts of information on a real time basis 
for example  we have integrated our ambientnms into an industry standard distribution and outage management system doms that provides for the delivery of faster  more accurate information to power outage notification and restoration systems 
doms allows utilities to quickly assess and respond to power delivery issues in reduced response time  thereby better managing disruptions and enhancing system reliability 
ambientnms also provides the functionality to predict  and precisely control  the amount of data traffic to be used by individual devices and the communications network as a whole 
utilities can systematically push software updates to deployed communications nodes and other downstream devices 
ambient power quality monitoring pqm 
in a changing and challenging power environment with increased electricity demand and adoption of renewable and low carbon technologies  distribution grids are under stress  and utilities are under pressure to maintain and improve efficiency  reliability and avoid or defer costly infrastructure upgrades 
the ambient power quality monitoring solution ambientpqm facilitates real time visibility of distribution networks for proactive grid management to help surmount these challenges and ensure continued quality of customer service 
ambientpqm is a combination of software and hardware pqm application  ambient smart grid nodes  and sensors that enables utilities and distribution network operators to measure an array of power quality parameters on medium and or low voltage distribution grids on overhead and or underground lines and at distribution substations or transformers

duke energy relationship since  we have maintained a strategic relationship with duke energy  and we believe that we are the leading supplier of its smart grid communications technology in connection with its smart grid implementation 
with what we believe is one of the most forward looking smart grid initiatives in north america  duke energy s smart grid deployment includes digital and automated technology  such as communications nodes  smart meters and automated power delivery equipment 
the following table summarizes the evolution of our relationship with duke energy security and safety testing of our communications nodes delivery of approximately communications nodes for pilot deployment commercial agreement for  communications nodes award to duke energy of million in american recovery and reinvestment act of digital grid stimulus funds and duke energy announcement of plans to invest a total of billion in smart grid deployment initiatives over five years long term supply agreement with duke energy to supply our communications nodes and services through full scale smart grid deployment begun by duke energy in ohio  which includes smart meters  automated power distribution equipment and a communications network encompassing more than  of our communications nodes   electric meters and  gas meters deployment by duke energy of approximately  of our communications nodes deployed a cumulative total of approximately  communications nodes  including approximately  of our communications nodes in the carolinas deployed a cumulative total of approximately  communications nodes 
table of contents duke energy is actively deploying thousands of our communications nodes each month and is licensing the ambientnms system  specifically for its deployment in ohio 
we believe that we are the predominant provider of communications nodes and network management system software for duke energy s ohio deployment 
we believe that we have demonstrated that our technology is secure  two way  flexible  open  scalable  reliable and cost effective through the total deployment of over approximately  communications nodes in the field with duke energy 
we believe that duke energy will continue to predominantly use our communications platform for the remainder of its ohio smart grid deployment through furthermore  duke energy s pilot deployment of over approximately  communications nodes in the carolinas predominantly uses our communications platform as well 
throughout the past five years  we have worked with duke energy to develop our communications platform  which has enabled duke energy s ability to deploy its smart grid initiatives 
we believe that we have a substantial opportunity to grow our business with duke energy 
in addition to the communications nodes scheduled for deployment in ohio  we estimate that duke energy would potentially require hundreds of thousands of communications nodes if it implements a full deployment of smart grid communications nodes in indiana  kentucky and the carolinas 
duke energy is using information from its north carolina pilot programs and its ohio deployment to enhance its customer experience in its other service territories

table of contents manufacturing and assembly we have a master supply and alliance agreement with bel fuse inc  a global producer of high quality electronic components  for the manufacture and assembly of our communications nodes 
we leverage the capabilities of bel fuse inc with respect to its low cost  global manufacturing capabilities  supply chain management and engineering expertise 
our products are made to order and are shipped directly to our customer s warehouses in the united states 
we purchase components  such as power cords  brackets and other accessories  which typically are shipped directly to our customer 
in order to minimize total cost and limit our exposure of excess inventory  we typically do not hold significant amounts of finished goods or component materials at any given time 
competition competition in the smart grid market is increasing and involves evolving technologies  developing industry standards  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer or regulatory requirements and localized market requirements 
competitive pressures require us to keep pace with the evolving needs of utilities  to continue to develop and introduce new products  features and services in a timely  efficient and cost effective manner  and to stay abreast of regulatory factors affecting the utility industry 
we compete with a wide array of manufacturers  vendors  strategic alliances  systems developers and other businesses 
these include smart grid communications technology companies  ranging from relatively smaller companies focusing mainly on communications technology to large internet  hardware and software companies 
in addition  some providers of smart meters may add communications capabilities in the future to provide some level of connectivity to a utility s back office 
we believe that we compete effectively in the market based on a number of factors 
these factors include the proven technology of our communications platform  our successful commercial deployments with duke energy  our focus on our communications platform  our scalable and interoperable products that we have purpose built for the utility environment and our competitive cost of ownership

risk factors our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by various risks  including  but not limited to the principal risks noted below 
we currently depend on one customer for substantially all of our revenue  and any material delay  reduction or cancellation of orders from this customer would significantly reduce our revenue and have a material negative impact on our business 
duke energy accounted for substantially all of our revenue for each of our last two fiscal years 
any material delay  reduction or cancellation of orders from duke energy would have a material adverse effect on our business  including significantly reduced revenue  unabsorbed overhead and incurred net losses 
although we have a long term contract that stipulates the general terms of our relationship  duke energy does not provide us with firm purchase commitments for the duration of the contract 
instead  duke energy provides us with periodic purchase orders 
duke energy can delay  reduce or cancel purchase orders at any time prior to the anticipated lead time for delivery of the products typically three months  subject to duke energy s payment of a cancellation fee not to exceed the price of the products cancelled 
duke energy may also delay  reduce or cancel its purchase orders without penalty if we are unable to deliver the products ordered thereunder within a specified time from the scheduled delivery date 
our immediate business opportunities continue to be primarily dependent on the success of our deployments with duke energy and the future decisions of duke energy relating to its smart grid deployment in its service territories 
our goal is to increase our business with duke energy and to attract new customers 
we may not achieve this goal within an acceptable period of time or at all 
the failure to increase our business with duke energy or to attract new customers would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we have a limited history of profitability on an annual basis  and we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability in future periods 
for  we had a net loss of million and an accumulated deficit of million however  million of this amount was associated with mark to market adjustments relating to common stock warrants and derivative liabilities in 
to grow our revenue and customer base  we also plan to increase spending associated with research and development and business development  thereby increasing our operating expenses 
these increased costs may cause us to incur net losses in the foreseeable future  and we may be unable to grow our revenue and expand our customer base to maintain profitability on an annual basis 
we may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms  or at all  to meet our future capital needs 
in the future  we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities  challenges  acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on a timely basis or on favorable terms  or at all 
any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity  convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it  our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 
we depend on factors affecting the utility industry over which we exercise no control 
we expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenue from sales of products to utilities 
purchases of our products may be deferred as a result of many factors  including economic downturns  slowdowns in new residential and commercial construction  access to capital at acceptable terms  utility specific financial circumstances  mergers and acquisitions  regulatory decisions  weather conditions and interest rates 
we may experience variability in operating results on an annual and a quarterly basis as a result of these factors 

table of contents utility industry sales cycles can be lengthy and unpredictable  which can negatively impact our ability to expand the deployment of our products with duke energy and to secure new customers 
sales cycles for smart grid projects are generally long and unpredictable due to budgeting  procurement and regulatory approval processes that can take up to several years to complete 
utility customers typically issue requests for quotes and proposals  establish evaluation committees  review different technical options  require pilot programs prior to commercial deployments  analyze cost and benefit metrics  consider regulatory factors and follow their normal budget approval processes 
in addition  many electric utilities tend to be risk averse and tend to follow industry trends rather than be the first to purchase new products or services 
these tendencies can extend the lead time for  or prevent acceptance of  new products or services  including those for smart grid initiatives despite the support of the federal government through grants and other incentives 
accordingly  potential customers may take longer to reach a decision to initiate smart grid programs or to purchase our products or services 
it is not unusual for a utility customer to go through the entire sales process and not accept any proposal or quote 
this extended sales process requires the dedication of significant time by our personnel to develop relationships at various levels and within various departments of utilities and our use of significant financial resources  with no certainty of success or recovery of our related expenses 
long and unpredictable sales cycles with utility customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or our financial condition 
the market for our products and services  and smart grid technology generally  is still developing and we will have difficulty expanding our business and securing new customers if the market develops less extensively or more slowly than we expect 
the market for our products and services  and smart grid technology generally  is still developing  and it is uncertain whether our products and services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness and ability of utilities to implement smart grid technology 
many utilities lack the financial resources and or technical expertise required to evaluate  deploy and operate smart grid technology 
regulatory agencies  including public utility commissions  govern utilities activities  and they may not create a regulatory environment that is conducive to the implementation of smart grid technologies in a particular jurisdiction 
furthermore  some utilities may be reluctant or unwilling to adopt smart grid technology because they may be unable to develop a business case to justify the up front and ongoing expenditures 
if utilities do not widely adopt smart grid technologies or do so more slowly than we expect  we will have difficulty expanding our business and securing new customers  which will adversely affect our business and operating results 
because the markets for our products are highly competitive  we may lose sales to our competitors  which would harm our revenue and operating results 
competition in the smart grid market is intense and involves changing technologies  evolving industry standards  new product introductions  changes in customer or regulatory requirements and localized market requirements 
competitive pressures require us to keep pace with the evolving needs of utilities  to continue to develop and introduce new products  features and services in a timely  efficient and cost effective manner  and to stay abreast of regulatory factors affecting the utility industry 
we compete with a wide array of manufacturers  vendors  strategic alliances  systems developers and other businesses  including other smart grid communications technology companies  ranging from relatively smaller companies focusing mainly on communications technology to large internet and software based companies 
in addition  some providers of smart meters may add communications capabilities to their existing business in the future  which could decrease our base of potential customers and could decrease our revenue and profitability 
early adopters  or customers that have sought out new technologies and services  have largely comprised the target market for our products 
because the number of early adopters is limited  we will need to expand our target markets by marketing and selling our products to mainstream customers to continue our growth 

table of contents some of our present and potential future competitors have  or may have  greater name recognition  experience and customer bases as well as substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing  manufacturing and other resources than we possess and that afforded them competitive advantages 
these potential competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  obtain more favorable pricing from suppliers and manufacturers and exert more influence on sales channels than we do 
competitors may sell products at lower prices in order to obtain market share 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services than we can 
competitors may introduce products and services that are more cost efficient  provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services 
our competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
other companies may also drive technological innovation and develop products that are equal or superior in quality and performance to our products and render our products non competitive or obsolete 
any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers  cause us to lower our prices in order to compete and reduce our market share and revenue  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to compete successfully with current or future competitors  we could experience material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
existing and future regulations concerning the electric utility industry may present technical  regulatory and economic barriers that may significantly impact future demand for our products 
international  federal  state and local government regulations and policies  as well as internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities  heavily influence the market for the electric utility industry 
these regulations and policies often relate to investment initiatives  including decisions relating to investment in smart grid technologies  as well as building codes  public safety regulations and licensing requirements 
in addition  certain of our contracts with our potential utility customers may be subject to approval by federal  state or local regulatory agencies  which may not be obtained or be issued on a timely basis 
in the united states and in a number of other countries  these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified and have a substantial impact on the market for our and other smart grid related technologies 
if such regulations or policies do not continue to gain acceptance for smart grid initiatives or the adoption of such initiatives takes substantially longer than expected  our prospects for developing new customers could be significantly limited 
duke energy and some potential utility customers have applied for government grants and may also seek to participate in other government incentive programs  and if those grants or other incentives are not received or are significantly delayed  our results of operations could suffer 
many utilities  including duke energy and some of our potential utility customers  have applied for grants and may seek to participate in other government incentive programs designed to stimulate the us economy and support environmental initiatives  including smart grid technologies 
in certain cases  such as with the american reinvestment and recovery act of  or arra  the us government has approved the funds  and the government and the utilities have entered into agreements under which the government has agreed to award funds to the utilities  but significant portions of the funds have not yet been distributed 
furthermore  such funds must be spent by the end of or awards will not be further funded  which could reduce the demand for smart gird related products beyond duke energy has applied for and been granted funding under arra programs  which may account for a significant portion of our current and anticipated future revenue and billings 
duke energy and our potential utility customers that seek these government grants or incentives may delay or condition the purchase of our products and services upon receipt of such funds or upon their confidence in the future disbursement and tax treatment of those funds 
if duke energy and our potential utility customers do not receive these funds or if their receipt of funds is significantly delayed  our operating results could suffer 
similarly  the receipt of government funds or incentives may be conditioned upon utilities meeting milestones and other requirements  some of which may not be known until a future point in time 
if our products and services do not meet the requirements necessary for receipt of government funds or other incentives  duke energy and our potential utility customers may delay or condition the purchase of our products and services until they meet these requirements  and our results of operations could suffer 
furthermore  there may not be government funds or incentives for utilities in future periods 
as a result  duke energy and our potential utility customers may not have the resources or incentives to purchase our products and services in those future periods 
the adoption of industry standards applicable to our products or services could limit our ability to compete in the marketplace 
standards bodies  which are formal and informal associations that seek to establish voluntary  non governmental product and technology standards  are influential in the united states and abroad 
we participate in voluntary standards organizations in order to both help promote non proprietary  open standards for interoperability with our products and to prevent the adoption of exclusionary standards 
however  we are not able to control the content of adopted voluntary standards and do not have the resources to participate in all voluntary standards processes that may affect our markets 
the adoption  or expected adoption  of voluntary standards that are incompatible with our products or technology or that favor our competitors products or technology could limit the market opportunity for our products and services or render them obsolete  any of which could materially and adversely affect our revenue  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if we become subject to product returns and product liability claims resulting from defects in our products  we may fail to achieve market acceptance of our products  and our business could be harmed 
we develop complex products for use in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of months from the date of sale 
despite testing by us and customers  our products may contain or may be alleged to contain undetected errors or failures 
in addition  a customer or its installation partners may improperly install or implement our products 
the integration of our products in smart grid networks or applications may entail the risk of product liability or warranty claims based on disruption to these networks or applications 
any such manufacturing errors or product defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
additionally  these defects could result in financial or other damages to a customer  cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
the occurrence of these problems would likely harm our business 
we currently maintain property  general commercial liability  errors and omissions and other lines of insurance 
such insurance may be insufficient in amount to cover any particular claim  or we might not carry insurance that covers a specific claim 
in addition  such insurance may not be available in the future or the cost of such insurance may increase substantially 
our ability to provide bid bonds  performance bonds or letters of credit may be limited and could negatively affect our ability to bid on or enter into significant long term agreements 
we may be required to provide bid bonds or performance bonds to secure our performance under customer contracts or  in some cases  as a prerequisite to submit a bid on a potential project 
our ability to obtain such bonds will depend upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and reputation  and external factors beyond our control  including the overall capacity of the surety market 
surety companies consider those factors in relation to the amount of our tangible net worth and other underwriting standards that may change from time to time 
surety companies may require that we collateralize a percentage of the bond with our cash or other form of credit enhancement 
events that affect surety markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future  or being available only at a significantly greater cost 
in addition  utilities may require collateral guarantees in the form of letters of credit to secure performance or to fund possible damages as the result of an event of default under any contracts with them 
if we enter into significant long term agreements that require the issuance of letters of credit  our liquidity could be negatively impacted 
our inability to obtain adequate bonding or letters of credit and  as a result  to bid or enter into significant long term agreements  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively compete and could impact our future business 
we currently rely on a single contract manufacturer to produce our products  and a loss of our sole contract manufacturer or its inability to satisfy our quality and other requirements could severely disrupt the production and supply of our products 
we utilize one contract manufacturer for all of our production requirements 
this manufacturing is conducted in china by a us based company that also performs services for numerous other companies 
we depend on our manufacturer to maintain high levels of productivity and satisfactory delivery schedules 
our reliance on our manufacturer reduces our control over the manufacturing process  exposing us to risks  including reduced control over quality assurance  product costs and product supply 
any financial  operational or other difficulties involving our manufacturer could adversely affect us 
we currently do not have guarantees of production capacity  prices  lead times or delivery schedules with our contract manufacturer 
since our manufacturer serves other customers  a number of which have greater production requirements than we do  our manufacturer could determine to prioritize production capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate production for us on short notice 
we could also encounter lower manufacturing productivity and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products 
any of these problems could result in our inability to deliver our products in a timely manner and adversely affect our operating results 
the loss of our relationship with our manufacturer or its inability to conduct its manufacturing services for us as anticipated in terms of cost  quality and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery  quality and performance requirements 
if this were to occur  the resulting decline in revenue would harm our business 
if any one of these risks materializes  it could significantly impact our operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under purchase orders with duke energy as well as future orders from duke energy or other customers 
qualifying new manufacturers is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operational problems 
if we had to transition to an alternative contract manufacturer we could experience operational delays  increased product costs and increased operating costs which could irreparably harm our relationship with duke energy  harm our reputation and could potentially impact our ability to secure new customers 

table of contents shortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs  thereby harming our results of operations 
the inability of our manufacturer to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders 
any delay in or loss of sales could adversely impact our operating results 
some of the materials used in the production of our products are available from a limited number of foreign suppliers  particularly suppliers located in asia 
in most cases  neither we nor our manufacturer has long term supply contracts with these suppliers 
as a result  we are subject to increased costs  supply interruptions and difficulties in obtaining materials 
security breaches involving our smart grid products or services  publicized breaches in smart grid products and services offered by others or the public perception of security risks or vulnerability created by the deployment of the smart grid in general  whether or not valid  could harm our business 
the security technologies we have integrated into our communications platform and products that are designed to detect unauthorized activity and prevent or minimize security breaches may not function as expected and our products and services  those of other companies with whose products our products and services are integrated or interact  or even the products of other smart grid solutions providers may be subject to significant real or perceived security breaches 
our communications platform allows utilities to monitor  compile and analyze sensitive information related to consumers energy usage  as well as the performance of different parts of the electric power distribution grid 
as part of our data transfer and managed services  we may store and or come into contact with sensitive consumer information and data when we perform operational  installation or maintenance functions for a utility customer 
if  in handling this information  we  our partners or a utility customer fails to comply with privacy or security laws  we could face significant legal and financial exposure to claims of government agencies  utility customers and consumers whose privacy is compromised 
even the perception that we  our partners or a utility customer has improperly handled sensitive  confidential information could have a negative effect on our business 
in addition  third parties may  through computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and other means  attempt to breach our security measures or inappropriately use or access our ambientnms or the communications nodes we have in the field 
if a breach is successful  sensitive information may be improperly obtained  manipulated or corrupted  and we may face legal and financial exposure 
in addition  a breach could lead to a loss of confidence in our products and services  and our business could suffer 
our current and anticipated future products and services allow authorized personnel to remotely control equipment at residential and commercial locations  as well as at various points on the grid 
for example  our software could allow a utility to remotely connect and disconnect electricity at specific customer locations 
if an unauthorized third party were to breach our security measures and disrupt  gain access to  or take control of  any of our products or services  our business and reputation could be severely harmed 
our products and services may also be integrated or interface with products and services sold by third parties  and rely on the security of those products and their secure transmission of proprietary data over the internet and other networks 
because we do not have control over the security measures implemented by third parties in their products or in the transmission of data over the internet and other networks  we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such third party products and transmissions 
concerns about security or customer privacy may result in the adoption of state or federal legislation that restricts the implementation of smart grid technology or requires us to make modifications to our products  which could significantly limit the deployment of our technologies or result in significant expense to modify our products 
although we have not experienced security breaches associated with our product  any real or perceived security breach could seriously harm our reputation and result in significant legal and financial exposure  inhibit market acceptance of our products and services  halt or delay the deployment by utilities of our products and services  cause us to lose sales  trigger unfavorable legislation and regulatory action and inhibit the growth of the overall market for smart grid products and services 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we use some open source software in our products and services that may subject our products and services to general release or require us to re engineer our products and services  which may cause harm to our business 
we use some open source software in connection with our products and services 
from time to time  companies that incorporate open source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and or compliance with open source license terms 
therefore  we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms 
some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost 
we monitor the use of open source software in our products and services and try to ensure that none of the open source software is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related product or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement 
however  such use could inadvertently occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code  pay damages for breach of contract  re engineer our products  discontinue the sale of our products in the event re engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations  and  as a result  we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenue and other operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
there can be no assurance that our revenue will increase or will not decrease on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results and cause our stock price to fluctuate include the following long  and sometimes unpredictable  sales and customer deployment cycles  changes in the mix of products and services sold  our current dependence on a single customer  changing market conditions  changes in the competitive environment  failures of our products or components that we use in our products that delay deployments  harm our reputation or result in high warranty costs  contractual penalties or terminations  product or project failures by third party vendors  utility customers or competitors that result in the cancellation  slowing down or deferring of projects  liquidated damage provisions in our current or future contracts  which could result in significant penalties if triggered or  even if not triggered  could affect our ability to recognize revenue in a given period  the ability of our suppliers and manufacturers to deliver supplies and products to us on a timely basis  delays associated with government funding programs for smart grid projects  political and consumer sentiment and the related impact on the scope and timing of smart grid deployment  and economic  regulatory and political conditions in the markets where we operate or anticipate operating 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of what our future performance will be 
in future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  in which case the price of our common stock may decline 
negative economic conditions in the united states and globally may have a material and adverse effect on our operating results  cash flow and financial condition 
the economies in the united states and countries around the world have been recovering from a global financial crisis and recession  which began in  but financial markets and world economies continue to be volatile 
significant long term effects will likely result from the financial crisis and recession  including slower and more volatile future global economic growth than during the years prior to the financial crisis of a lower future economic growth rate could result in reductions in sales of our products and services  slower adoption of new technologies and an increase price competition 
any of these events would likely harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents international manufacturing and sales risks could adversely affect our operating results 
our products are produced in china by a us based  third party contract manufacturer 
we may also expand our addressable market by pursuing opportunities to sell our products in international markets 
we have had little experience operating in markets outside of the united states 
accordingly  new markets may require us to respond to new and unanticipated regulatory  marketing  sales and other challenges 
we may not be successful in responding to these and other challenges that we may face as we enter and attempt to expand in international markets 
international operations also entail a variety of other risks 
the manufacture of our products abroad and our potential expansion into international markets expose us to various economic  political and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results  including the following potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights  political  social or economic instability in certain parts of the world  unexpected changes in legislature or regulatory requirements of foreign countries  differing labor regulations  tariffs and duties and other trade barrier restrictions  possible employee turnover or labor unrest  the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws  currency exchange fluctuations  potentially adverse tax consequences  and potentially longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections 
international operations are also subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political  social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations 
one or more of these factors could adversely affect any international operations and result in lower revenue than we expect and could significantly affect our profitability 
our inability to protect our intellectual property could impair our competitive advantage  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
our success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies and products 
we rely on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyrights  trademarks  confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property  but these measures may provide only limited protection 
we generally enter into written confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with our employees  consultants  customers  manufacturers and other recipients of our technologies and products and assignment of invention agreements with our employees and consultants 
we may not always be able to enforce these agreements and may fail to enter into any such agreement in every instance when appropriate 
we license from third parties certain technology used in and for our products 
these third party licenses are granted with restrictions  therefore  such third party technology may not remain available to us on terms beneficial to us 
our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights or obtain from third parties the right to use necessary technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
patents may not issue from the patent applications that we have filed or may file in the future 
our issued patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and claims of our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength  or issued in the proper geographic regions  to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
we have not applied for  and do not have  any copyright registration on our technologies or products 
we have applied to register certain of our trademarks in the united states and other countries 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain registrations of principle or other trademarks in key markets 
failure to obtain registrations could compromise our ability to protect fully our trademarks and brands and could increase the risk of challenge from third parties to our use of our trademarks and brands 
we may be required to incur substantial expenses and divert management attention and resources in defending intellectual property litigation against us 
we cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of others 
while we are not currently subject to any infringement claim  any future claim  with or without merit  could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources  including the attention of management  and could require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or the terms of any offered licenses may be unacceptable to us 
if forced to cease using such technology  we may be unable to develop or obtain alternate technology 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing  using or selling certain of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
furthermore  parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to make  use or sell our products in the united states or abroad 
such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we are obligated under certain agreements to indemnify the other party in connection with infringement by us of the proprietary rights of third parties 
in the event we are required to indemnify parties under these agreements  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur substantial expenses and divert management resources in prosecuting others for their unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights 
other companies  including our competitors  may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies  duplicate our technologies or design around our patents and may have or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products 
effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we may do business  such as china 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our technologies and products that we regard as proprietary 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate or competitors may independently develop similar technologies 
if our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights  we could face increased competition in the market for our technologies and products 

table of contents should any of our competitors file patent applications or obtain patents that claim inventions also claimed by us  we may choose to participate in an interference proceeding to determine the right to a patent for these inventions because our business would be harmed if we fail to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
even if the outcome is favorable  this proceeding could result in substantial cost to us and disrupt our business 
in the future  we also may need to file lawsuits to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace  and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel 
our success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and key personnel 
the competition for qualified management and key personnel  especially engineers  is intense 
although we maintain noncompetition and nondisclosure covenants with most of our key personnel  we do not have employment agreements with most of them 
the loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire  train and retain key personnel  especially engineers and technical support personnel  could delay the development and sale of our products  disrupt our business and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan 
potential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives  and the failure to do so could impede our growth 
we anticipate that we will enter into strategic alliances 
among other matters  we continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology  to provide necessary know how  components or supplies  to attract additional customers  and to develop  introduce and distribute products utilizing our technology 
any strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives  and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated 
the failure of these alliances may impede our ability to introduce new products and expand our business 
failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may lead investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial data 
maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements 
in evaluating the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of our quarterly report as of and for the three and six months ended june   management concluded that there was a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for embedded derivatives associated with certain convertible debt and warrants to purchase common stock 
this material weakness led to the need for the restatement of the company s financial statements for the years ended december  through and for the first quarter of and the failure of the company to file its quarterly report on form q for the interim period ended june  on a timely basis 
as of december   we remediated the material weakness previously reported in amendment no 
on form k for the year ended december  if we fail to otherwise maintain effective controls over financial reporting in the future  it could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements 
our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and sec rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming  difficult and costly  and the failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce accurate financial statements and on our stock price 
under sec regulations adopted pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls 
in addition  we anticipate that at some point in the future  we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting that includes a statement that our independent auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
while we have spent considerable time and effort in designing  documenting and testing our internal control procedures  we may need to spend additional financial and other resources improving our processes  which may result in increased general and administrative expenses and may shift management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
despite our efforts  we can provide no assurance as to our independent auditor s conclusion with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we fail to comply in a timely manner with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of regarding internal control over financial reporting or to remedy any material weaknesses in our internal controls that we may identify  such failure could result in material misstatements in our financial statements  cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  limit our ability to raise needed capital and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents risks related to our common stock our principal stockholder exerts substantial influence over us 
vicis capital master fund  or vicis  owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of december  consequently  vicis is able to exert substantial influence over our company and control matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of all our directors  approving any amendments to our certificate of incorporation  increasing our authorized capital stock  effecting a merger or sale of our assets and determining the number of shares available for issuance under our stock plans 
as a result of vicis control  no change of control of our company can occur without vicis consent 
vicis voting control may discourage transactions involving a change of control of our company  including transactions in which you as a holder of our common stock might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over the then current market price 
vicis is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in our company to a third party and may do so without stockholder approval and without providing for a purchase of any stockholder shares of common stock 
accordingly  shares of common stock may be worth less than they would be if vicis did not maintain voting control over us 
we may issue additional capital stock in the future  which would dilute our existing stockholders 
in the future  we may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities  including shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock  resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders 
we are authorized under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to issue  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock 
we currently do not have any commitments for funding 
in addition  we may also issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel  future acquisitions  future private placements of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes 
future issuances of our common stock  or the perception that such issuances could occur  could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following our ability to execute our business plan  the gain or loss of significant orders  volume and timing of customer orders  actual or anticipated changes in our operating results  changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers  market conditions and trends within the utilities industry and the smart grid market  introductions of new products of new pricing policies by us or by our competitors  the gain or loss of significant customers  industry developments  regulatory  legislative or other developments affecting us or the utilities industry in general or the smart grid market in particular  economic and other external factors  general global economic and political instability  changes in laws or regulations affecting the utilities industry  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors  litigation involving us  the utilities industry or the smart grid market  recruitment or departure of key personnel  future sales of our common stock  price and volume fluctuations it the overall stock market from time to time  changes in investor perception  the level and quality of any research analyst coverage of our common stock  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts  the financial guidance we may provide to the public  any changes in such guidance or our failure to meet such guidance  and trading volume of our common stock or the sale of stock by our parent  management team or directors 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
public announcements by various companies concerning  among other things  their performance  accounting practices or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance 

table of contents future sales of common stock by vicis or others or other dilutive events may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  even if our business is doing well 
our existing stockholders could sell any or all of the shares of common stock owned by them from time to time for any reason 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  future sales of our common stock  or the availability of shares for future sales  will have on the market price of our stock 
as of december   we had the following outstanding securities approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  approximately million shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of then outstanding stock options at a weighted average exercise price of per share  approximately  shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of then outstanding warrants at a weighted average exercise price of per share  and approximately million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our various stock incentive plans 
we do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future  hence stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock  and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain future earnings  if any  to fund our operations and support our growth strategies 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations  financial conditions  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law  capital requirements and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
accordingly  stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment 
this appreciation may not occur 
our ability to use us net operating loss carryforwards might be limited  subjecting our corporate income to earlier taxation 
at december   we had available approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards  for us income tax purposes which expire at various dates through however  due to changes in stock ownership resulting from historical investments provided by vicis  we expect that the use of the us net operating loss carryforwards will be significantly limited under section of the internal revenue code 
as such  approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards will expire and will not be available to use against future tax liabilities 
in addition  our ability to utilize the current net operating loss carryforwards might be further limited by the issuance of common stock in future offerings 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited  our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  which could result in lower profits

overview ambient corporation is an award winning provider of smart grid communications technology for utilities 
our innovative platform enables utilities to deploy and integrate multiple smart grid applications and technologies  in parallel on a single communications infrastructure  supporting smart metering  distribution automation  distribution management  demand response  distributed generation and more 
company history we were incorporated in in the state of delaware 
through the third quarter of  we were a development stage company 
we are focused on the development of a communications platform that meets the needs of utilities  including specifically for the implementation of smart grid applications 
on july   we implemented a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of for shares the reverse split 
on august   our common stock began to trade on the nasdaq capital market under our new ticker symbol ambt 
duke energy relationship since  we have maintained a strategic relationship with duke energy 
the utility is actively deploying our communications nodes and is licensing our ambientnms for its deployment in ohio 
we believe that we are the predominant provider of communications nodes and network management system software for duke energy s ohio deployment 
we believe that we have demonstrated that our technology is secure  two way  flexible  open  scalable  reliable and cost effective through the total deployment of approximately  communications nodes in the field with duke energy 
we believe that duke energy will continue to predominantly use our communications platform for the remainder of its ohio smart grid deployment through furthermore  duke energy s pilot deployment of approximately  communications nodes in the carolinas predominantly uses our communications platform as well 
throughout the past five years  we have worked with duke energy to develop our communications platform  which has enabled duke energy s ability to deploy its smart grid initiatives 
we believe that we have a substantial opportunity to grow our business with duke energy 
in addition to the communications nodes scheduled for deployment in ohio  we estimate that duke energy would potentially require hundreds of thousands of communications nodes if it implements a full deployment of smart grid communications nodes in indiana  kentucky and the carolinas 
duke energy is using information from its north carolina pilot programs and its ohio deployment to enhance its customer experience in its other service territories 
since we established our relationship with duke energy  we have been focused on developing our technology to meet the needs of their smart grid communications platform 
based upon the success of the relationship and our ability to prove our technology  we have recently begun to expand our infrastructure to focus on new business development  marketing and sales programs and further technology development in order to expand our customer base  and we expect to increase investment in our marketing and sales efforts over the next twelve months 
backlog we define our backlog as products that we are obligated to deliver based on firm commitments relating to purchase orders received from customers 
as of december   we had backlog of approximately million  entirely from duke energy 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  investments  intangible assets and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition total revenue consists primarily of sales of hardware  software  and maintenance services 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services 
hardware sales consist of our ambient smart grid communications nodes which are physical boxes that contain the hardware and embedded software needed for communications and data collection in support of smart grid assets 
the system software embedded in our communications nodes is used solely in connection with the operation of the physical boxes 
our proprietary software ambientnms is our smart grid network management system that controls the large numbers of communications nodes  devices and customers on a smart grid 
nms software is offered on a stand alone basis 
we generally include a period of free maintenance services beginning from the sale of the communication nodes and nms software 
as such  we recognize a portion of the revenue from the sales of our products upon delivery to the customer 
the revenue allocated to the free period of maintenance services is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of performance 
we offer additional software maintenance service  on a fee basis  that entitles the purchasers of our products and ambientnms software to post contract customer support including help desk support and  unspecified updates and upgrades to our products on a when and if available basis 
maintenance services are recognized ratably over the period of performance 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of i hardware products and ii software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with applicable industry specific software accounting guidance for i standalone sales of software products  ii maintenance renewals  and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware

 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  amendments to asc topic  revenue recognition asu formerly eitf issue and asu no 
 certain arrangements that include software elements  amendments to fasb asc topic  software asu formerly eitf 
asu eliminates the residual method and requires arrangement consideration to be allocated using the relative selling price method  which requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using the best estimated selling price besp of each element when a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe 
asu removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
asu and asu are effective for arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company adopted asu and effective january  we evaluate each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it should be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting 
the delivered items or item shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if it has standalone value to the customer and there are no customer negotiated refunds or return rights 
we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each unit of accounting in a multiple element arrangement based on its relative selling price  and include our bundled hardware and software component as one unit of accounting and the free period of maintenance as a separate unit of accounting 
the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to each of the deliverables 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if it exists or third party evidence tpe if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable  we use our best estimate of selling price besp for that deliverable 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
we determine vsoe of a deliverable based on the price at which we sell the deliverable on a standalone basis to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement 
vsoe has been established for our software maintenance element 
when vsoe cannot be established for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements  we attempt to estimate the selling price of each element based on tpe 
when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe  we establish the besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 
besp has been established for our bundled hardware and software portion of the arrangement 
when establishing besp the company considers multiple factors including  but not limited to  the relative value of the features and functionality being delivered to the customer  and general pricing practices 
based on our analysis of pricing stated in contractual arrangements for our hardware products in historical multiple element transactions  we have concluded that we typically price our hardware and embedded software at the contractually agreed upon amounts 
therefore  we have determined that  for our hardware and embedded software for which vsoe or tpe is not available  our besp is generally comprised of prices based on our contractually agreed upon rates 
we have established an annual review process around vsoe  tpe and besp 
the company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software related products  including the sale of maintenance services to previously sold software  in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance 
for such multiple element software transactions  revenue is allocated to each element based on the residual method when vsoe has been established for the undelivered element 
if the company cannot objectively determine the vsoe of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements  the company defers revenue until vsoe is established for any remaining undelivered elements  or all elements are delivered and services have been performed 
inventory valuation 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
certain factors may impact the net realizable value of our inventory  including technological changes  market demand  new product introductions and significant changes to our cost structure 
we make estimates of reserves for obsolescence based on the current product mix on hand and its expected net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by us  additional inventory write downs or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we consider lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory reserves as an adjustment to the cost basis of the underlying inventory 
accordingly  we do not record favorable changes in market conditions to inventory in subsequent periods 

table of contents software development costs 
we have historically expensed costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products as incurred 
after we establish technological feasibility  we capitalize additional development costs 
no software development costs have been capitalized as of december  or stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance now codified as financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc   compensation stock compensation formerly known as sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provision of asc  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award  the expected option term  the expected volatility of our stock price over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the stock option s expected term and the annual dividend yield 
fair value of warrants 
warrants are recorded as liabilities at their estimated fair value at the date of issuance  with subsequent changes in estimated fair value recorded in other income expense in the statement of operations in each subsequent period 
fair value of the warrants is determined by management using a multiple scenario  probability weighted option pricing model using the following inputs the fair value of the underlying common stock at the valuation measurement date  the risk free interest rates  the expected dividend rates  the remaining contractual terms of the warrants  the expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock  and the probability of certain events occurring 
the assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the warrants represent our best estimates  however  these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and different assumptions are used  the warrant liabilities and the change in their estimated fair values could be materially different 
deferred income taxes 
we recognize deferred income taxes for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
at december   our deferred income tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and stock based compensation charges that have been fully offset with a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty that a tax benefit will be realized from the assets in the future 
at december   we had available approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards  for us income tax purposes which expire at various dates through however  due to changes in stock ownership resulting from historical investments  the use of the us net operating loss carryforwards are significantly limited under section of the internal revenue code 
as such  approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards will expire and will not be available to use against future tax liabilities 
warranties 
we account for our warranties under the fasb asc  contingencies 
our current standard product warranty includes a one year warranty period for defects in material and workmanship 
we currently accrue a liability of approximately of current communications node revenues for the estimated future costs of meeting our warranty obligation  based on our actual historical return rate for repair of products within the one year warranty period 
we make and revise this estimate based on the number of communications nodes delivered and our historical experience with warranty claims 
we continually monitor the rate of actual product returns for repair and the quality of our products including the quality of the products produced by our us based contract manufacturer in china 
we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  in an effort to ensure the quality of our products and reduce our warranty exposure 
the warranty obligation will be affected not only by product failure rates  but also the costs to repair or replace failed products and potential service and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if our actual product failure rates  repair or replacement costs  or service or delivery costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted in the period that such events or costs become known 
our software license agreements generally include provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software infringes upon a third party s intellectual property rights 
we have not provided for any reserves for such warranty liabilities 
our software license agreements also generally include a warranty that our software will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation 
we also warrant that we will perform services in a manner consistent with industry standards 
to date  we have not incurred any material costs associated with these product and service performance warranties  and as such we have not provided for any reserves for any such warranty liabilities in our operating results 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the year ended december  and the year ended december  total revenue 
total revenue for was million compared to million in  representing a decrease of approximately 
substantially all revenue from and was derived from one customer 
the decrease in total revenue is primarily attributable to our primary customer s decision to modify its node deployment schedule which extended installations of nodes further into we expect that our primary customer will continue to be the source of a substantial portion of our revenue for the next twelve months 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for was million compared to million in the decrease in cost of goods sold primarily reflected a decrease in sales volume to duke energy 
cost of goods sold includes all costs related to the manufacture of our products by our contract manufacturer  accruals for warranty and other overhead costs

we believe that our continued development efforts are critical to our strategic objectives of enhancing our technology while simultaneously reducing costs 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in as we continue to develop and improve our communications platform 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were approximately million compared to million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in personnel and related costs related to our increased efforts to market and commercialize our communications platform

other significant costs included professional fees for legal  accounting and other services 
in  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to increase our efforts to market and commercialize our communication platform to additional customers 
write off of deferred financing costs 
in august  we filed a form s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for a proposed public offering of our common stock  for which we had incurred approximately  in expenses as of december  such costs were capitalized and were to be charged to additional paid in capital upon completion of our proposed public offering 
in april  we voluntarily filed an application with the securities and exchange commission requesting the withdrawal of such registration statement 
we requested withdrawal of the registration statement based on then current market conditions and management s ensuing determination to not proceed with the contemplated offering at that time 
accordingly  previously capitalized deferred financing costs of approximately  were written off in the three months ended march other income  net 
other income for was approximately  compared to approximately  for the corresponding period in  primarily representing the partial recovery of loans made by us to an unrelated company during and  which had been previously written off in mark to market adjustment of warrant liability 
changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities resulted in a net non cash gain of  in and million in provision for income taxes 
as a result of our loss before taxes of million  the company did not record a provision for income taxes in as a result of our income before taxes of million in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately  in  primarily reflecting federal alternative minimum taxes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of our securities and  more recently  with revenue from sales of our products 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was approximately million and net cash provided by operating activities during was approximately million 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was due primarily to a net loss of million partially offset by stock based compensation expense of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million which were subsequently collected in january and a reduction in accounts payable of million

for the year ended december   net cash used by financing activities consisted primarily of approximately  in deferred financing costs offset by proceeds from exercises of warrants and stock options 
we believe that our business plan will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operating needs for the next months 
however  there are factors that can impact our ability continue to fund our operating needs  including our expectations regarding the continued favorable relationship with duke energy  which we expect will continue to be a substantial source of our revenue  our ability to maintain product pricing as expected  particularly in light of increased competition and its unknown effects on market dynamics  our and our contract manufacturer s ability to reduce manufacturing costs as expected  our ability to expand sales volume  which is highly dependent on the smart grid implementation plans of duke energy and other utilities  and the need for us to continue to invest in operating activities in order to remain competitive or acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our products  expand the breadth of our business  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
if we cannot effectively manage these factors  we may need to raise additional capital in order to fund our operating needs 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it  our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited and we may be required to implement spending reduction measures in order to preserve cash 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and certain other capital lease obligations  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships
