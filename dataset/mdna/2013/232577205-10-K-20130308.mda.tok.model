during the year ended december  and  respectively  we transferred million and million of demonstration equipment to fixed assets 
in march  we commenced an option exchange program in which we offered eligible option holders the opportunity to voluntarily exchange certain underwater stock options for a lesser number of new stock options with a lower exercise price 
our us employees were eligible to participate in the exchange program  and our directors and executive officers were not eligible to participate 
the exchange ratios for the exchange program were determined by using the black scholes option pricing model to approximate a value for value exchange  meaning that the value of the eligible stock options was equal to the value of the new stock options 
the exchange program  which was subject to rule e under the securities exchange act of  as amended  was completed on april  in the exchange program  eligible option holders tendered eligible options with exercise prices of or greater to purchase an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock  representing of the total shares of class a common stock underlying options eligible for exchange 
new stock options were granted to purchase an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock in exchange for the cancellation of the tendered eligible options 
the exercise price per share of each new option granted in the exchange program is  which was the closing price of our class a common stock as reported by the nasdaq global market on april  all eligible stock options were fully vested as of april   when the exchange program was completed 
because the fair value of the eligible stock options was equal to the fair value of the new stock options calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  we did not recognize any incremental stock based compensation expense as a result of the exchange program 
in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our class a common stock  from time to time  on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions under a stock repurchase program

sold  shares of our class a common stock 
in connection with the closing of the offering  all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock converted on a one for one basis into shares of class a common stock 
as a result  there are no longer any shares of our class b common stock issued or outstanding  and we may not issue shares of class b common stock in the future 
we received aggregate net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses  of approximately million in the offering

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth above are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgment and estimates by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue in accordance with the revenue recognition topic asc s  we recognize revenue from sales of aesthetic treatment systems and parts and accessories when each of the following four criteria are met delivery has occurred  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period as services are provided 
we defer  until earned  payments that we receive in advance of product delivery or performance of services 
when we enter into arrangements with multiple elements  which may include sales of products together with service contracts and warranties  we allocate revenue among the elements based on each element s relative fair value in accordance with the principles of accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple element arrangements 
this allocation requires us to make estimates of fair value for each element 
we adopted asu during the second quarter of and applied it retrospectively beginning january  accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of our receivable balances  known collectability issues and our historical experience with losses 
we work to mitigate bad debt exposure through our credit evaluation policies  reasonably short payment terms and geographical dispersion of sales 
our revenues include export sales to foreign companies located principally in europe  the asia pacific region and the middle east 
we obtain letters of credit for foreign sales that we consider to be at risk 
inventories and allowance for excess and obsolescence we state all inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out method 
we monitor standard costs on a monthly basis and update them annually and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
our inventory balance was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase in inventory relates to increased purchases to meet increased revenue requirements with the launch of new products 

table of contents we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 
our inventory allowance as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
intangible assets we capitalize and include in intangible assets the costs of developed technology and patents  customer relationships  trade names and business licenses 
intangible assets are recorded at fair value and stated net of accumulated amortization and impairments 
we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line or accelerated method  based on the useful life of the asset over which it is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we evaluate the realizability of our definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances or business conditions indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on expectations of future undiscounted cash flows for each asset group 
if the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we estimate the fair value of the assets  generally utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the assets using a risk adjusted discount rate 
to estimate the fair value of the assets  we use market participant assumptions pursuant to asc  fair value measurements 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised useful life 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
we do not amortize our goodwill  but instead test for impairment at least annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying value of the asset 
our annual test for impairment occurs on the first day of our fourth quarter 
we have adopted asu intangibles goodwill and other  an amendment to asc  which updates how an entity will evaluate its goodwill for impairment 
the guidance provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
if further testing is required  the test for impairment continues with the two step process 
the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed  wherein the reporting unit s carrying value is compared to the implied fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  impairment exists and must be recognized 
we have concluded that cynosure  inc represents one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing and we have performed a qualitative assessment on that reporting unit 
as a result of our assessment  we determined that goodwill is not impaired as of december  product warranty costs and provisions we typically provide a one year parts and labor warranty on end user sales of our aesthetic treatment systems 
distributor sales generally include a warranty on parts only 
we estimate and provide for future costs for initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we base product warranty costs on related material costs  technical support labor costs and overhead 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties by considering historical material  labor and overhead expenses and applying the experience rates to 
table of contents the outstanding warranty period for products sold 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates and warranty costs 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise our estimated warranty liability 
fair value of financial instruments asc  fair value measurements topic  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable markets data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc  stock compensation topic asc 
asc requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period 
accordingly  we review our actual forfeiture rates periodically and align our stock compensation expense with the options that are vesting 
the fair value of each stock option we granted is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires the input of various subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
our estimated expected stock price volatility is based on our own historic volatility for  and and based on a weighted average of our own historical volatility and of the average volatilities of other guideline companies in the same industry for we believe this is more reflective and a better indicator of the expected future volatility  than using an average of a comparable market index or of a comparable company in the same industry

our functional currency is the us dollar 
our policy is to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by having most of our assets and liabilities  as well as most of our revenues and expenditures  in us dollars  or us dollar linked

we sell inventory to our subsidiaries in

upon settlement of these debts  we may record realized foreign exchange gains and losses in our statements of operations 
we may incur negative foreign currency translation charges as a result of changes in currency exchange rates
