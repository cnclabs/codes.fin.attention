licenses in  a subsidiary of schering plough entered into a licensing agreement with centocor ortho biotech inc centocor  a j j company  to market remicade  which is prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
in  schering plough s subsidiary exercised an option under its contract with centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize simponi  a fully human monoclonal antibody 
the company had exclusive marketing rights to both products outside the united states  japan and certain other asian markets 
in december  schering plough and centocor revised their distribution agreement regarding the development  commercialization and distribution of both remicade and simponi  extending the company s rights to exclusively market remicade to match the duration of the company s exclusive marketing rights for simponi 
in addition  
table of contents schering plough and centocor agreed to share certain development costs relating to simponi s auto injector delivery system 
on october   the european commission ec approved simponi as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and other immune system disorders in two presentations a novel auto injector and a prefilled syringe 
as a result  the company s marketing rights for both products extend for years from the first commercial sale of simponi in the eu following the receipt of pricing and reimbursement approval within the eu 
in april  merck and j j reached an agreement to amend the agreement governing the distribution rights to remicade and simponi 
under the terms of the amended distribution agreement  merck relinquished marketing rights for remicade and simponi to j j in territories including canada  central and south america  the middle east  africa and asia pacific effective july  merck retained exclusive marketing rights throughout europe  russia and turkey the retained territories 
in addition  beginning july   all profits derived from merck s exclusive distribution of the two products in the retained territories are being equally divided between merck and j j 
j j also received a one time payment from merck of million in april competition and the health care environment competition the markets in which the company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry are highly competitive and highly regulated 
the company s competitors include other worldwide research based pharmaceutical companies  smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus  and generic drug and consumer health care manufacturers 
the company s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors  industry consolidation  patents granted to competitors  competitive combination products  new products of competitors  the generic availability of competitors branded products  new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as the company s products mature 
in addition  patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors  and the outcome can be highly uncertain 
an adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to certain products 
competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown 
the effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted 
pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively 
with its long standing emphasis on research and development  the company is well positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations 
additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control  flexibility to meet customer specifications  an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service 
the company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances  such as joint ventures and licenses  and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions 
however  the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements  even for products protected by patents 
for example  the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth for the company s products in that therapeutic category 
the highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues  scientific and technological advances  product innovation  the quality and price of the company s products  effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors 
the company s consumer care operations face competition from other consumer health care businesses as well as retailers who carry their own private label brands 
the company s competitive position is affected by several factors  including regulatory and legislative issues  scientific and technological advances  the quality and price of the company s products  promotional efforts and the growth of lower cost private label brands 
health care environment global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access 
in the united states  federal and state governments for many years also have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay 
for example  federal laws require the company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by medicaid and to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain public health service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients 

table of contents against this backdrop  the united states enacted major health care reform legislation in  which began to be implemented in various insurance market reforms have advanced and will continue through full implementation in the law is expected to expand access to health care to about million americans by the end of the decade who did not previously have insurance coverage 
with respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry  the mandated medicaid rebate increased from to  expanded the rebate to medicaid managed care utilization  and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal b drug discount program 
the law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a point of service discount to medicare part d beneficiaries when they are in the medicare part d coverage gap ie  the so called donut hole 
approximately million and million was recorded by merck as a reduction to revenue in and  respectively  related to the donut hole provision 
also  pharmaceutical manufacturers are now required to pay an annual health care reform fee 
the total annual industry fee was billion in and will be billion in the fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of sales to certain government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
the company recorded million and million of costs within marketing and administrative expenses in and  respectively  for the annual health care reform fee 
the company also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations  government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the company s sales and profit margins 
in the united states  these include i practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers  and ii us federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid  including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of and the patient protection and affordable care act of changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the united states  as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare  medicaid  and private sector beneficiaries  could result in further pricing pressures 
in addition  in the effort to contain the us federal deficit  the pharmaceutical industry could be considered a potential source of savings via legislative proposals that have been debated but not enacted 
these types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls in the medicare prescription drug program part d 
in addition  congress may again consider proposals to allow  under certain conditions  the importation of medicines from other countries 
it remains very uncertain as to what proposals  if any  may be included as part of future federal budget deficit reduction proposals that would directly or indirectly affect the company 
efforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in several european countries 
many countries have announced austerity measures  which include the implementation of pricing actions to reduce prices of generic and patented drugs and mandatory switches to generic drugs 
while the company is taking steps to mitigate the impact in the eu  the austerity measures continued to negatively affect the company s revenue performance in and the company anticipates the austerity measures will continue to negatively affect revenue performance in additionally  the global economic downturn and the sovereign debt issues in certain european countries  among other factors  have adversely affected foreign receivables in certain european countries 
while the company continues to receive payment on these receivables  these conditions have resulted in an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding thereby adversely affecting cash flows 
governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and related measures that aim to put pressure on the price of pharmaceuticals and constrain market access 
the company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in to varying degrees in the emerging markets 
the company s focus on and share of revenue from emerging markets has increased 
countries in these markets may be subject to conditions that can affect the company s efforts to continue to grow in emerging markets  including potential political instability  significant currency fluctuation and controls  financial crises  limited or changing availability of funding for health care  and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the company 
further  the company may engage third party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries  which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the company s risk exposure 

table of contents the full impact of health care reform  as well as continuing budget pressures on governments around the world  cannot be predicted at this time 
in addressing cost containment pressures  the company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to attempt to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care 
the company seeks to work with government policymakers to encourage a long term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings 
in markets with historically low rates of government health care spending  the company encourages those governments to increase their investments in order to improve their citizens access to appropriate health care  including medicines 
certain markets outside of the united states have implemented health technology assessments and other cost management strategies which require additional data  reviews and administrative processes  all of which increase the complexity and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on reimbursement available and obtained 
operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition  industry regulation and cost containment efforts 
although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the company s business  the company continually takes measures to evaluate  adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces 
government regulation the pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by regional  country  state and local agencies around the world 
governmental regulation and legislation tend to focus on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness  as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement  especially related to the pricing of products 
of particular importance is the fda in the united states  which administers requirements covering the testing  approval  safety  effectiveness  manufacturing  labeling  and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals 
in many cases  the fda requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the united states 
the eu has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification  labeling  advertising  wholesale distribution  integrity of the supply chain  enhanced pharmacovigilance monitoring and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use 
these provide mandatory standards throughout the eu  which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the eu member states 
the company s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives  consequently  it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the company s business 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations  including launching new drugs  in this regulatory environment 
access to medicines as a global health care company  merck s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines 
the company also recognizes that it has an important role to play in helping to improve access to its products around the world 
the company s efforts in this regard are wide ranging and include a set of principles that the company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the company s worldwide approach to expanding access to health care 
for example  the company has been recognized for pricing many of its products through a differential pricing framework  taking into consideration such factors as a country s level of economic development and public health need 
in addition  the merck patient assistance program provides medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the united states who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who  without the company s assistance  cannot afford their merck medicine and vaccines 
building on the company s own efforts  merck has undertaken collaborations with many stakeholders to improve access to medicines and enhance the quality of life for people around the world 

table of contents for example  in  merck announced that it would launch merck for mothers  a long term effort with global health partners to create a world where no woman has to die from preventable complications of pregnancy and childbirth 
the launch includes a year  million initiative that applies merck s scientific and business expertise to making proven solutions more widely available  developing new technologies and improving public awareness  policy efforts and private sector engagement to reduce maternal mortality 
merck has also in the past provided funds to the merck foundation  an independent organization  which has partnered with a variety of organizations dedicated to improving global health 
one of these partnerships is the african comprehensive hiv aids partnership in botswana  a collaboration with the government of botswana that was renewed in and supports botswana s response to hiv aids through a comprehensive and sustainable approach to hiv prevention  care  treatment  and support 
privacy and data protection the company is subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally 
the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve 
there has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the company s business  including recently enacted laws and regulations in the united states  europe  asia and latin america and increased enforcement activity in the united states and other developed markets 
distribution the company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers  hospitals  government agencies and managed health care providers  such as health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions 
human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians  wholesalers  physician distributors and government entities 
the company s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness  safety and value of the company s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice  group practices  hospitals and managed care organizations 
the company sells its animal health products to veterinarians  distributors and animal producers 
the company s over the counter  foot care and sun care products are sold through wholesale and retail drug  food chain and mass merchandiser outlets  as well as club stores and specialty channels 
raw materials raw materials and supplies  which are generally available from multiple sources  are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the company s business 
patents  trademarks and licenses patent protection is considered  in the aggregate  to be of material importance in the company s marketing of its products in the united states and in most major foreign markets 
patents may cover products per se  pharmaceutical formulations  processes for or intermediates useful in the manufacture of products or the uses of products 
protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries 
the protection afforded  which may also vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage 
the food and drug administration modernization act includes a pediatric exclusivity provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant 
current us patent law provides additional patent term under patent term restoration for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review by the fda 

table of contents patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the company normally provide market exclusivity 
the company has the following key us patent protection including patent term restoration and pediatric exclusivity for major marketed products product year of expiration in the us propecia formulation use asmanex use formulation avelox dulera use formulation combination integrilin compound use formulation nasonex use formulation formulation temodar emend follistim aq pegintron conjugates mature ifn alpha invanz compound composition zostavax use zetia vytorin nuvaring delivery system noxafil rotateq intron a recombivax method of making vectors saphris sycrest use formulation with pending patent term restoration januvia janumet juvisync janumet xr compound salt zioptan with pending patent term restoration isentress victrelis with pending patent term restoration gardasil compound patent unless otherwise noted
