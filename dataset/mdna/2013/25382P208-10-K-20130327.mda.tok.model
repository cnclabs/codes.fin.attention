table of contents current trends and recent developments for the company overview we supply technology based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities  for the law enforcement and security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets 
we have the ability to integrate electronic  radio  computer  mechanical  and multi media technologies to create unique solutions to our customers requests 
we began shipping our flagship digital video mirror in march we have developed additional products to complement our dvm and dvm in car video products including lower priced in car video mirrors the dvm and dvm speed detection laser ally and body worn camera firstvu products designed for law enforcement usage 
furthermore  we have recently launched a new line of digital video mirrors the dvm and dvm plus that serve as event recorders for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets that expands our customer base beyond the traditional law enforcement agencies 
we have additional research and development projects that we anticipate will result in several new product launches during we believe that the launch of these new products will help to diversify and increase our product offerings and result in increased revenues in the future 
we experienced a negative trend in our operating results in and and have reported operating losses during all but one of the previous eight fiscal quarters 
the following is a summary of our recent operating results on a quarterly basis for the three months ended december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  total revenue gross profit gross profit margin percentage total selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss operating margin percentage net income loss 
table of contents our business is subject to substantial fluctuations on a quarterly basis as reflected in the significant variations in revenues and operating results in the above table 
these variations result in part from the timing of large individual orders from international  as well as domestic  customers and our new products  such as the dvm  dvm and dvm we incurred an operating loss during fourth quarter of  on revenues of  compared to operating income of  on total revenues of  in the third quarter the operating income reported in third quarter reflected the positive effect of a litigation settlement recorded in september see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements and was the first profitable quarter since fourth quarter when we reported operating income of  we believe that regardless of the operating loss in the fourth quarter of  the operating results for such quarter demonstrates continued improvement from late and early our gross margin percentage decreased to compared to in third quarter  in second quarter and in first quarter due to an improvement in international sales  increased costs to improve the wireless transfer modules wtm and discounting some larger international sales transactions in the fourth quarter our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in fourth quarter compared to third quarter due to the litigation settlement reported in third quarter that did not recur in the fourth quarter  and the costs incurred to consolidate our operations into one facility during the fourth quarter which was approximately  our international revenues during decreased over levels as we shipped international orders totaling  in  compared to  during we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenues in and beyond due to the timing of larger orders from international  as well as domestic  customers 
for  we are focusing on increasing revenues and improving gross margins on sales in addition to continuing our general and administrative cost reduction and containment measures 
we plan  however  to continue to invest in research  development  sales and marketing resources on a prudent basis 
our inventory levels increased slightly during compared to and the primary cause was increases in the laser ally products which are subject to minimum purchase requirements 
management has implemented a program to reduce overall inventory levels in as we attempt to improve sales  decrease production rates and reduce procurement costs throughout our supply chain 
there have been a number of factors trends affecting our recent performance  which include revenues increased in the fourth quarter to  from  in the third quarter and were the highest achieved since third quarter  when revenues aggregated  we attribute the revenue increases in the second  third and fourth quarters of to the reorganization of our law enforcement sales force  which was begun in late and continued through the first and second quarters of we have moved to an employee based sales force  as opposed to our historical usage of independent sales agents for domestic markets 
we believe the sales force reorganization will continue to have a positive impact in the future  but recognizes that the economic climate will continue to depress certain state and local tax bases and may contribute to a challenging business environment in we have recently launched additional products to complement our dvm and dvm in car video products in an effort to diversify our sources of revenue 
in that respect  we launched the laser ally speed detection system in third quarter  the dvm event recorder during first quarter  the dvm in car video system in third quarter and the dvm in car video system in fourth quarter  and plan to launch the new firstvu hd and ultravu during we are hopeful that our expanded product line will help generate incremental revenues to supplement our traditional dvm plus and dvm revenues 
in addition  the dvm and dvm plus event recorders are designed for commercial fleet operators  which will allow us to seek new customers outside of law enforcement 
our recently released products  including the dvm  the dvm  the dvm  the dvm plus  and the laser ally  contributed of the total sales for compared to for 
table of contents our gross profit on sales declined to during fourth quarter reversing the gross profit of we achieved in third quarter our gross profit was in second quarter and in first quarter the decrease in fourth quarter was due to an increase in international revenues  increased costs to improve our wtm s and discounting of a few larger sales transactions in the fourth quarter gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal we attribute the improvement in to our supply chain improvement plan as we continued producing and shipping both dvm plus and dvm units containing the lower cost components  and our ability to transition sales volume to our recently added products  which have higher margins than our dvm and dvm in car video products 
during  we implemented our supply chain plan to improve gross margin through better outsourcing of our component parts in the future  including from foreign sources  which allowed us to reduce our production overhead costs through headcount and other cost reductions 
our goal is to continue to improve margins during through our supply chain initiative  reduce manufacturing overhead  increase sales volume and improve product mix 
we continue to focus on reducing the costs of our products through changes to our supply chain  where we are emphasizing outsourcing of component part production and changing our supply chain vendors to lower cost alternative suppliers throughout the world 
however  we are experiencing increased price competition and pressure from certain of our competitors that has led to pricing discounts on larger contract opportunities 
we believe this pricing pressure will continue as our competitors attempt to regain market share and revive sales and expect it to have a negative impact on our gross margins to some degree during we believe that current and potential customers may be delaying or reducing the size of orders due to a number of factors  including budget reductions  in order to preserve their currently available funding and budgets 
many of the existing federal funding programs require matching funds from the local agencies that continues to be difficult given the budget restrictions 
we cannot predict whether such funding on a matching basis will have a positive impact on our revenues in the future 
our international revenues decreased in fiscal to  of total revenues  compared to  of total revenues for during second quarter  we reorganized our international sales structure and believe this will lead to more positive results in the future 
international revenues in the fourth quarter were higher than the previous three quarters of combined 
international revenues for the fourth quarter were  compared to   and  for third quarter  second quarter and first quarter  respectively 
we have made a number of bids for international customers  however  international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business 
we also believe that our new products may appeal to international customers  in particular the dvm  dvm and dvm plus  although we can make no assurances in this regard 
we have built in the capability to install a variety of language packs into our dvm system  which currently includes english  spanish  turkish and arabic  with additional languages to become available during this language flexibility may be a positive factor in our efforts to improve future international sales 
we have reorganized our production and manufacturing operations by placing a greater emphasis on contract manufacturers 
uncertainties regarding the size and timing of large international orders make it difficult for us to maintain efficient production and staffing levels if all orders are processed through our manufacturing facility 
by outsourcing more of our production requirements to contract manufacturers  we believe that we can benefit from greater volume purchasing and production efficiencies  while at the same time reducing our fixed and semi fixed overhead costs 
it is  of course  important that selected contract manufacturers be able to ramp up production quickly in order to meet the varying demands of our international customers 
our recent operating losses caused deterioration in our cash and liquidity in and we borrowed  under two unsecured subordinated notes the notes payable to a private  third party lender 
the notes are due and payable in full on may  and may be prepaid without penalty at any time 
we utilized the proceeds to retire our bank line of credit and provide cash for operations 
we had no institutional credit lines available to provide additional working capital as of december  at december   we had available cash balances of  and approximately million of working capital  primarily in the form of inventory and accounts receivable 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on financial conditions  changes in the financial conditions  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenue or expenses 
we are a party to operating leases and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments described in note to our consolidated financial statements and we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that represent commitments to future payments for goods and services 
we entered into a supply and distribution agreement on may  under which we were granted the exclusive worldwide right to sell and distribute a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device and derivatives to its customers 
the term of the agreement was months after the date the supplier began full scale production of the product which commenced in august and final certification of the product was obtained 
the agreement had minimum purchase requirements of  units per period over three commitment periods 
on january   the supply and distribution agreement was amended to reduce the minimum purchase commitment over the second and third years by compared to the original commitment 
we agreed to release our world wide right to exclusively market the product to the law enforcement community in exchange for the reduction in the purchase commitment 
after the initial term has expired  the parties may continue on a month to month basis and is terminable by either party upon days advance notice 
the contract may be terminated earlier in case of material breach by either party that is not cured within thirty days of notice of the breach 
the agreement contains required minimum order quantities and fixed prices per unit according to the following schedule minimum order commitment amount commitment time period commitment purchases remaining commitment march through february march through february the above table reflects the modified terms of the amended supply and distribution agreement 
the supplier is responsible for all warranty  damage or other claims  losses or liabilities related to the product and is obligated to defend and indemnify us against such risks 
we held approximately  of such products in finished goods inventory as of december  and have sold approximately units since the beginning of the agreement through december

table of contents we sell our products and services to law enforcement and commercial customers in the following manner sales to domestic and international customers are made direct to the end customer typically a law enforcement agency or a commercial customer through commissioned third party sales agents or our direct sales force  who are our employees 
revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the end customer 
sales to international customers are made through independent distributors who purchase products from the company at a wholesale price and sell to the end user typically law enforcement agencies or a commercial customer at a retail price 
the distributor retains the margin as its compensation for their role in the transaction 
the distributor generally maintains product inventory  customer receivables and all related risks and rewards of ownership 
revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the distributor consistent with the terms of the distribution agreement 
for a portion of we had a number of independent distributors selling under this arrangement 
repair parts and services for domestic and international customers are generally handled by our inside customer service employees 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of the repair parts and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer 
we may discount our prices on specific orders when considering the size of the order  the specific customer and the competitive landscape 
we believe that our systems are cost competitive compared to our primary competition and generally are lower priced when considering comparable features and capabilities 
revenues for the years ended december  and were derived from the following sources years ended december  dvm plus dvm dvm dvm laser ally dvm dvm plus repair and service firstvu accessories and other revenues we experienced a change in the sales mix of our products for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our newer products  including the dvm  the dvm  the dvm  the dvm plus  and the laser ally  contributed of our total sales for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the comparable period ending december  we expect that the sales mix will continue to transition from the dvm plus and dvm to our newer products during 
table of contents revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of   due to the following factors our revenues decreased due to the challenging economy that continued to negatively impact state  county and municipal budgets which fund our law enforcement customers 
we believe that current and potential customers may have delayed or reduced the size of their orders due to a number of factors  including their local budget reductions and anticipation of receiving the federal government s stimulus funds in order to preserve their currently available funding and budgets 
our average order size decreased from approximately  in the year ended december  to  during the year ended december  we shipped fifteen individual orders in excess of  for a total of approximately million in revenue  in the year ended december  compared to thirteen orders individually in excess of  for total revenue of approximately million in the year ended december  we believe this reflects reduced law enforcement budgets where the customers are covering only the minimum required needs rather than full fleet deployments 
in addition  the new products we introduced in and firstvu  laser ally  dvm  dvm plus  dvm and dvm all have lower average selling prices than our legacy digital video mirror lines 
repair orders at lower average invoice amounts have also increased significantly as our installed base continues to come off of warranty 
these repair orders are at lower average price levels and are impacting our overall average invoice size 
we maintained consistent retail pricing on our law enforcement mirror models during and do not plan any material changes in pricing during  including the new products recently introduced 
our newer mirror based products include the dvm  dvm  dvm plus and the dvm  which will be sold at lower retail pricing levels compared to our legacy products during the due to fewer features relative to our legacy dvm plus and dvm models 
we are experiencing some price competition and discounting from our competitors as they attempt to regain market share 
for certain opportunities that involve multiple units and or multi year contracts we have occasionally discounted our products to gain or retain market share and revenues 
we reorganized our domestic sales force and organization for our law enforcement channel during traditionally  we have used third party sales agents to market our law enforcement products domestically 
we have changed principally to an employee based direct sales force that provides us with more control and monitoring of our sales force and their daily activities 
in addition  we have reduced the size of certain sales territories and consequently increased the overall number of domestic sales territories and sales personnel  from at the beginning of to currently  in order to better penetrate the market 
during  we converted one third party sales agent to be an employee based direct sales person and replaced the remaining third party sales agents with new employee based sales personnel 
our objective with this new employee based model  including the replacement of many sales agents  is to encourage our sales personnel in lower performing territories to improve their efforts and consequently their sales results 
we believe that a portion of the revenue decrease experienced in and early revenues resulted from third party sales agents reducing their sales efforts because they did not have the financial resources to travel  meet and market directly to their customers as a result of the difficult economic conditions 
we reorganized to address these concerns 
we believe that the transition to the employee based direct sales force model resulting in a number of new territories and sales personnel during and the training of new sales personnel that replaced underperforming salesmen in certain existing territories have caused temporary disruptions and contributed to the lower revenues in compared to in conjunction with the sales force reorganization  we have identified  hired and trained new sales personnel in that principally replaced underperforming sales agents 
we hope that this transition will result in improved revenues from these historically underperforming territories in the future 
our international revenues decreased to  representing of total revenues  during the year ended december  compared to  representing of total revenues  during the year ended december  during second quarter  we reorganized our international sales structure and believe this will lead to more positive results in the future 
international revenues in the fourth quarter were better than the previous three quarters of combined 
international revenues for the fourth quarter were  compared to   and  for third quarter  second quarter and first quarter  respectively 
the reorganization of our international sales personnel and efforts began showing positive results in the second half of and we are hopeful this positive trend continues in we have presented a number of bids for international customers  however  international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business 
we also believe that our new products may appeal to international customers  in particular the dvm  dvm  dvm and dvm plus 
we have built in the capability to install a variety of language packs into our dvm system  which currently includes english  spanish  turkish and arabic  with additional languages to become available during the balance of this language flexibility may be a positive factor in our efforts to improve future international sales 

table of contents cost of revenue cost of revenue on units sold for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease in costs of goods sold is partially due to the decrease in revenues during the year ended december  compared to  and improvement in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues during the twelve months ended december  compared to cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased to during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  our goal is to reduce cost of sales as a percentage of revenues during and beyond 
improving gross margins through reductions in conversion costs engineering changes and rework and manufacturing inefficiencies related to our base products  such as the dvm and dvm plus  are main focuses of management and engineering 
in addition  we are continuing to reorganize our production and manufacturing operations by placing a greater emphasis upon contract manufacturers  including those located offshore 
uncertainties regarding the size and timing of large international orders make it difficult for us to maintain efficient production and staffing levels if all orders are processed through our manufacturing facility 
by outsourcing more of our production requirements to contract manufacturers  we believe that we can benefit from greater volume purchasing and production efficiencies  while at the same time reducing our fixed and semi fixed overhead costs 
we believe that the selected contract manufacturers will be able to ramp up production quickly in order to meet the varying demands of our international customers 
we expect that our newer product offerings  in particular the dvm  dvm  dvm  and dvm plus  should improve our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales 
we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures to ramp up production of the new products because our internal process is largely assembling subcomponents  testing and shipping of completed products or we use contract manufacturers 
we rely on our subcontractors to produce finished circuit boards that represent the primary components of our products  thereby reducing our need to purchase capital equipment 
we had  and  in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at december  and december   respectively 
we are maintaining component parts specific to the legacy dvm in inventory at levels reasonably expected to be consumed for service and repair demands 
total raw materials and component parts were  and  at december  and december   respectively  an increase of  
the increase in raw materials and component parts is attributable to a buildup in anticipation of moving our assembly and warehousing operations to a new facility in late november and the associated delays in ramping up our assembly operations before december  we believe the introduction of new parties to our supply chain will continue to help reduce cost of sales as a percent of revenues during finished goods balances were  and  at december  and december   respectively  an increase of  
the increase in finished goods was primarily in the laser ally products  which are subject to minimum purchase requirements 
finished goods at december  are primarily the laser ally products and the dvm plus products which will be used to fulfill international and domestic orders during finished goods also included increased supplies of our other newer products  including the firstvu  dvm  dvm and dvm at december  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory as a percent of total inventory balances decreased to as of december  compared to at december  we believe that our obsolescence risk was less at december  compared to december  because our management team made a concerted effort in to dispose of unusable parts from older versions of our products 
therefore  previously reserved obsolete parts were disposed of during and have been applied to our reserve balance 
we believe these reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at december  gross profit gross profit for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase is commensurate with the significant improvement in cost of sales as a percent of revenue during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period offset by the decline in revenues 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our goal is to continue to improve our margins based upon the expected margins of our newer products  in particular the dvm  dvm  dvm and dvm plus  if they gain traction in the marketplace and increase commercial production in in addition  as revenues increase from these products  we will seek to further improve our margins from these new products through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components 
we plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production  quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
overall selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to from in and the significant components of selling  general and administrative expenses are as follows year ended december  research and development expense selling  advertising and promotional expense stock based compensation expense professional fees and expense executive  sales  and administrative staff payroll litigation charge and related expenses other total research and development expense 
we continue to focus on bringing new products to market  including updates and improvements to current products 
our research and development expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  because of our continued cost containment efforts and increased scrutiny of engineering resources 
we employed a total of engineers at december   most of whom are dedicated to research and development activities for new products 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in and in  illustrating our continuing commitment to bring new products to market and expanding our current product line 
we have active research and development projects on several new products  as well as upgrades to our existing product lines 
we anticipate launching at least two new products during  including the firstvu hd and ultravu products  which are the results of our research and development efforts 
we consider our research and development capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis 
selling  advertising and promotional expenses 
selling  advertising and promotional expense totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
a large component of selling  promotional and advertising expense was commissions paid to our independent agents who represent our sales force in the domestic market 
these agents generally received a commission on sales ranging from to of the gross sales price to the end customer 
sales commissions totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of   sales commissions as a percentage of overall sales decreased to during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in our overall sales commissions as a percentage of sales reflects the results of our sales force reorganization initiative that is intended to improve our revenues 
as part of such reorganization  we are now principally an employee based direct sales force model where such sales personnel receive a base salary plus travel expenses and have the opportunity to earn commissions if their respective sales exceed their assigned quotas 
during the twelve months ended december   we did not renew contracts with sales agents  converted one sales agent from a third party representative to an employee based sales person and increased the number of domestic territories from to territories to improve the coverage of our potential customer base 
additionally  we are now reimbursing expenses relative to our employee based direct sales force to travel  meet with  and market to directly to our customers 
the salary component for our law enforcement and commercial sales channel sales force and managers are included in selling  advertising and promotional expenses 
such salary expenses are becoming a larger component of our overall selling expenses due to the sales force reorganization 
sales commissions  salaries and reimbursed travel expenses paid to our employee based direct sales force are all components of our selling  advertising and promotional expenses 
promotional and advertising expenses totaled  during the years ended december  compared to  during the year ended december   an increase of  
the increase is primarily attributable to media advertising in trade publications and participation in more trade shows 
we have decided to invest in significantly more written media for all of our products  as well as attending more trade shows focused on both our commercial and law enforcement sales channels 
furthermore  we expect increases in expenses for brochures and other marketing initiatives designed to help penetrate new commercial markets for our dvm and dvm plus event recorders and to introduce our new firstvu hd  ultravu  dvm and the dvm products to the law enforcement channel in 
table of contents stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease was primarily attributable to stock options issued in january to officers and directors becoming fully vested in january and the associated stock based compensation expense ceasing in december professional fees and expense 
professional fees and expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
professional fees during were related primarily to normal public company matters including the reverse stock split  intellectual property matters and litigation matters 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the company s cost containment measures coupled with the settlement of certain litigation 
in addition  professional fees associated with the litigation against a former contract manufacturer and z have been classified separately as litigation charge and related expenses in the statement of operations for year ended december  we expect increased legal fees regarding several patents and trademarks that have been or may be filed on our new products and litigation expense in executive  sales and administrative staff payroll 
executive  sales and administrative staff payroll expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
this decrease is attributable to approximately  of severance costs we incurred in first quarter as part of the cost containment initiative that did not recur in the twelve months ended december  in january  the vice president of marketing retired and the vice president of corporate development resigned and their responsibilities were assumed by the executive officers for a savings of approximately  for the twelve months ended december  in june  the vice president of engineering resigned and his responsibilities were assumed by other engineering management for a savings of approximately  for the twelve months ended december  in addition  we reduced the number of our sales support staff during in connection with the restructuring of our sales and marketing organization 
management anticipates the reduction in executive  sales and administrative payroll will continue during as the full benefit of the headcount reductions is realized 
however  such reductions may be offset partially because we may find it necessary to hire additional technical support staff in to handle field inquiries as our installed customer base continues to increase and additional technical support is required for our new products such as the firstvu hd  ultravu  dvm  dvm  and dvm litigation charge credit and related expenses 
litigation charges and expenses totaled  and for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the trial against a former contract manufacturer began on september  and the parties agreed to a settle the lawsuit on september  the insurance company involved agreed to pay  to settle the litigation 
legal fees incurred for defense of the lawsuit were offset against the proceeds and the net settlement for this lawsuit was  at december  the z trial began on june  and concluded with a jury verdict on july  that resulted in a net judgment against us in the amount of  further  despite our arguments at trial  the court also refused to reconsider the interlocutory summary judgment rulings rendered against us prior to trial in the amount of  which became final upon conclusion of the trial 
accordingly  the total judgment entered against us was  we believe there were a number of errors in the court rulings and the judgment entered on july  and are appealing them 
we incurred  of additional legal fees during the year ended december  to defend the z lawsuit  which included the accrual of legal fees expected during the appeal process 
other 
other selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease in was attributable to our cost containment measures that generally reduced the cost of information technology  telephone and internet services as we negotiated better contracts rates or moved to new service providers 
we plan to continue our cost containment initiatives in and expect that other selling  general and administrative costs will continue to decline in 
table of contents operating loss for the reasons previously stated  our operating loss was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an improvement of  
operating loss as a percentage of revenues decreased to in compared to in interest income interest income decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the decrease in interest income was a result of our decreased average cash balances and lower average interest rates earned on such balances during the year ended december  compared to interest expense we incurred interest expense of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we issued a note in the principal amount of million during second quarter  the proceeds of which were used to repay the outstanding line of credit 
we issued another note in the principal amount of million in fourth quarter and extended the maturity date of the first note such that both notes are due and payable in full on may  in july we extended the maturity dates of the notes from may to may  the outstanding principal balance on our notes was million as of december   less the unamortized discount of loss on debt extinguishment during november  we extended the maturity date of the million note issued in may and issued a second note for million under the same terms 
the modification of the original note payable was treated as an early extinguishment of the debt 
accordingly  the remaining unamortized discount as of the date of modification  was charged off and reflected as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the statement of operations 
the note was restructured again in july and it was determined this modification was not an early extinguishment of debt and the remaining unamortized discount of the note payable will be amortized to interest expense ratably over the modified terms of the notes 
loss before income tax benefit as a result of the above  we reported a loss before income tax benefit of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an improvement of  
income tax benefit we recorded no income tax benefit related to our losses for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to our decision to continue providing a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of december  and  respectively 
during  we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by  whereby our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved due to our recent operating losses 
we had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards and  of research and development tax credit carryforwards as of december  available to offset future net taxable income 
net loss as a result of the above  for the years ended december  and  we reported net losses of  and  respectively  an improvement of  
basic and diluted loss per share the basic and diluted loss per share was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  for the reasons previously noted 
all outstanding stock options were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended december  and because of the net loss reported for each period 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overall on may   we borrowed million under an unsecured credit facility with a private  third party lender 
on november   we borrowed an additional million under an unsecured credit facility with the same private  third party lender 
the loans are represented by two promissory notes the notes that bear interest at the rate of per annum and are payable interest only on a monthly basis 
the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as such term is defined in the notes 
on july   we entered into an agreement with the lender that extended the maturity dates of both of the notes from may  to may  the existing notes are unsecured and do not prevent us from obtaining new senior secured financings 
we may seek additional credit facilities to complement the notes and provide us with funding should the need arise to finance growth or other expenditures 
we had over  of available cash and equivalents and net working capital of approximately million as of december  net working capital as of december  includes approximately million of accounts receivable and million of inventory 
management believes that it can achieve reduced inventory levels into to provide funding for operations  however no assurances can be given in that regard 
we do not consider raising capital through an equity offering to be a viable alternative to supplement working capital needs  given our current public equity valuation 
however  we may find it necessary to raise additional capital if we do not regain profitability during  are unable to improve liquidity through a reduction in our inventory and accounts receivable levels in the near term  add to our existing credit facilities  and do not have other means to support our planned operating activities 
our ability to obtain such capital  if required  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operations and financial condition  including our ability to continue operating as a going concern 
further such capital  if available  most likely would not be on terms favorable to us and our shareholders 
cash and cash equivalents balances as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of  a decrease from a balance of  at december  summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections are the main elements of the  net decrease in cash during the year ended december  operating activities  of net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december   a deterioration of  the deterioration in cash flow from operations for was primarily the result of our net losses and increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
investing activities  of net cash used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we consolidated our operations into one new location which resulted in capital expenditures for new furniture  fixtures  and equipment 
during and  we also incurred costs for patent applications on our proprietary technology utilized in our new products and included in intangible assets 
in july   we were required to post a supersedeas bond in the amount of  to stay the execution of a judgment entered against the company and appeal the decision 
financing activities  of net cash used in financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december   a deterioration of  during the year ended december   we acquired capital equipment financed through capital lease obligations and payments on such obligations represented the cash used in financing activities 
during the year ended december   we issued subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of million  the proceeds of which were used to repay the  outstanding balance on our bank line of credit and to provide working capital 
we paid  of debt issuance costs related to the notes issued during 
table of contents the net result of these activities was a decrease in cash of  to  for the year ended december  commitments we had  of cash and cash equivalent balances and net positive working capital approximating million as of december  accounts receivable balances represented  of our net working capital at december  we intend to collect our outstanding receivables on a timely basis and reduce the overall level during  which would help to provide positive cash flow to support our operations during inventory represented  of our net working capital at december  and finished goods represented  of total inventory 
we expect that finished goods will be converted to cash when customer orders are received and shipments occur during we are actively managing the overall level of inventory and believe that such levels will be reduced during by our sales activities  which should provide additional cash flow to help support our operations during capital expenditures 
we had commitments for capital expenditures to various contractors who provided leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment for our new facility that we moved to in late such commitments for capital expenditures totaled  at december lease commitments operating leases 
we have several non cancelable operating lease agreements for office space and warehouse space that expire at various dates through april in september  the company entered into a non cancelable long term facility lease to combine all of their operations into one location effective november we have also entered into month to month leases for equipment and facilities 
rent expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  related to these leases 
we paid a security deposit in conjunction with the new facility lease in september in the amount of  as reflected in the table below  we have a rent holiday and discounted rent for the first months of the new facility lease  which was effective november  year ending december and thereafter license agreements 
we have several license agreements whereby we have been assigned the rights to certain licensed materials used in its products 
certain of these agreements require us to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products shipped containing the licensed material on a quarterly basis 
royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents supply and distribution agreement 
we entered into a supply and distribution agreement on may  under which we were granted the exclusive worldwide right to sell and distribute a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device and derivatives to its customers 
the term of the agreement was months after the date the supplier began full scale production of the product which commenced in august and final certification of the product was obtained 
the agreement had minimum purchase requirements of  units per period over three commitment periods 
on january   the parties amended the supply and distribution agreement to reduce the minimum purchase commitments over the second and third years by from the original commitment 
we also agreed to terminate our world wide right to exclusively market the products to the law enforcement community in exchange for the reduction in the purchase commitment 
after the initial term has expired  the parties may continue on a month to month basis and is terminable by either party upon thirty days advance notice 
the contract may be terminated earlier in case of material breach by either party that is not cured within thirty days of notice of the breach 
the agreement contains required minimum order quantities and fixed prices per unit according to the following schedule minimum order commitment amount commitment time period commitment purchases remaining commitment march through february march through february the above table reflects the modified terms of the amended supply and distribution agreement 
the supplier is responsible for all warranty  damage or other claims  losses or liabilities related to the product and is obligated to defend and indemnify us against such risks 
the company held approximately  of such products in finished goods inventory as of december  and have sold approximately units since the beginning of the agreement through december  litigation 
on june   we filed suit against z in the us district court for the district of kansas claiming breach of a production software license agreement entered into during october and the rescission of a second limited license agreement entered into during january among other claims  we asserted that z failed to deliver the material required under the contracts  that the product that was delivered by z was defective and or unusable  and that the january contract should be rescinded and declared void  unenforceable and of no force or effect 
we paid license fees and made other payments to z totaling  to date under these contracts 
z denied our claims and filed counterclaims that allege we did not have the right to terminate the contracts and therefore that it was damaged for loss of profits and related damages 
in those counterclaims  z sought to recover approximately million from us exclusive of prejudgment interest 
our insurance carrier settled a portion of the counterclaims under our director and officer liability insurance policy 
the counterclaims that were not resolved by that settlement remained in controversy 
the trial of those claims began on june  and concluded with a jury verdict on july  the principal parts of the verdict were i an award of  to us on grounds that z had breached its contract with us  ii an award of  in favor of z by finding that we had breached the contract by failing to pay the balance of certain engineering fees  and iii an award of  in favor of z based on the court s finding that we breached the contract by failing to place an initial order for so called dm modules from z as a result  the net judgment against us was  further  despite our arguments at trial  the court also refused to reconsider the interlocutory summary judgment rulings rendered against us prior to trial in the amount of  which became final upon conclusion of the trial 
accordingly  the total judgment entered against us was  and no prejudgment interest on that sum was awarded 

table of contents we believe there are a number of errors in the court s rulings and the judgment entered on july  and are appealing them 
we accrued the  judgment entered against us as a long term liability as of december  due to the expected time required to conclude the appeal process 
we have charged  to operations during the twelve months ended december  as litigation charge and related expenses 
such charges include the  judgment and all related legal fees and expenses incurred and accrued during the twelve months ended december  we have also accrued the legal fees expected to be incurred during the appeal process 
in order to stay the execution of judgment during the appeal process  we were required to post a bond in the amount of  in july and the respective funds will be reflected as restricted cash in future balance sheets until such time as the bond is no longer required 
on october   the circuit court of jackson county  missouri awarded the company an interlocutory judgment against a former contract manufacturer 
the company had filed for and received a temporary restraining order in june that forbids the supplier from engaging in certain actions involving the company 
the interlocutory judgment was entered in favor of the company against the supplier that in effect cancelled all purchase orders and confirmed that the company has no further obligations  whether monetary or otherwise  to the supplier 
the company received a notice of the filing of bankruptcy under chapter effective october  by this supplier 
in the bankruptcy court  the company sought and received relief from the automatic stay in order to liquidate and obtain a final judgment against the supplier 
on may   the court granted a default judgment awarding the company damages and legal fees totaling  the company filed a garnishment claim against all insurance proceeds from policies issued and in force covering the supplier when these actions occurred 
the trial relating to this claim commenced on september  the parties agreed to settle the lawsuit on september  the insurance company involved agreed to pay  to settle the litigation relating to the garnishment claim and the company received the payment on october  the company recorded the  settlement in litigation charge credit and related expenses and all legal fees incurred for the lawsuit were offset against the settlement as of december  the net amount included in litigation charge credit and related expenses at december  for this lawsuit were 
we are also involved as a plaintiff and defendant in ordinary  routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to its business from time to time  including customer collections  vendor and employment related matters 
management believes the likely outcome of any other pending cases and proceedings will not be material to its business or its financial condition 
k plan 
we sponsor a k retirement savings plan for the benefit of our employees 
the plan  as amended  requires us to provide matching contributions for employees who elect to contribute up to of their compensation to the plan and matching contributions for employee s elective deferrals on the next of their contributions 
we made matching contributions totaling  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
each participant is vested at all times in employee and employer matching contributions 
stock repurchase program 
during june  our board of directors approved a program that authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock in the open market  or in privately negotiated transactions  through july  our board of directors approved an extension of this program to july   which terminated at such point 
we made no purchases under this program during the years ended december  and the company has repurchased  shares at a total cost of  average cost of per share under this program from inception to december  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  financial statements  of this report 
while the selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective judgments and estimates  we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements  potentially involve the most subjective judgments in their selection and application  and are the most susceptible to uncertainties and changing conditions revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty reserves  
table of contents stock based compensation expense  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts 
revenue is recognized for the shipment of products or delivery of service when all four of the following conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we review all significant  unusual or nonstandard shipments of product or delivery of services as a routine part of our accounting and financial reporting process to determine compliance with these requirements 
our principal customers are state  local and federal law enforcement agencies  which historically have been low risks for uncollectible accounts 
however  we do have commercial customers and international distributors that present a greater risk for uncollectible accounts than such law enforcement customers and we consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances 
our historical bad debts have been negligible with less than  charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of million since we commenced deliveries during as of december  and december   we recorded a reserve for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
we periodically perform a specific review of significant individual receivables outstanding for risk of loss due to uncollectibility 
based on our specific review  we consider our reserve for doubtful accounts to be adequate as of december  however  should the balance due from any significant customer ultimately become uncollectible then our allowance for bad debts will not be sufficient to cover the charge off and we will be required to record additional bad debt expense in our statement of operations 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
we record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory items 
the amount of the reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  management performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence 
management uses its best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves based on this analysis 
in addition  we adjust the carrying value of inventory if the current market value of that inventory is below its cost 
inventories consisted of the following at december  and december  december  december  raw material and component parts work in process finished goods subtotal reserve for excess and obsolete inventory total 
table of contents we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements 
as reflected above  our inventory reserves represented of the gross inventory balance at december   compared to of the gross inventory balance at december  finished goods at december  are composed primarily of the laser ally and the dvm plus products  which will be used to fulfill international and domestic orders during finished goods also included supplies of our newer products  including the firstvu  dvm  dvm and dvm at december  raw material and component part inventory balances were increased at december  compared to december   as we moved our assembly operations and warehousing to a new location in late november we experienced some expected delays in ramping up our assembly operations as a result of the move which lead to the increased levels in raw materials at december  we believe that our obsolescence risk was less at december  compared to december  because our management team made a concerted effort in to scrap unusable parts from the older versions of our products 
therefore  previously reserved obsolete parts were disposed of during and were applied to our reserve balance 
we believe the reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at december  if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or significant engineering changes to our products that are not anticipated and appropriately managed  additional inventory write downs may be required in excess of the inventory reserves already established 
warranty reserves 
we generally provide up to a two year parts and labor warranty on our products to our customers 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information on the nature  frequency  and average cost of claims 
we actively study trends of claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize claims 
our warranty reserves were decreased to  as of december  compared to  as of december   which reflects the decreased number of units under warranty and the resolution of the wireless transfer module failures experienced in our new dvm product failure rate has improved significantly during and  which has contributed to the relatively stable level of warranty reserves 
we have introduced several new products  including the firstvu  laser ally  dvm  dvm  dvm and thermal ally  for which we have limited exposure since the third party manufacturers of these products are responsible for all warranty claims 
there is a risk that we will have higher warranty claim frequency rates and average cost of claims than our history has indicated on our legacy mirror products 
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods 
stock based compensation expense 
we grant stock options to our employees and directors and such benefits provided are share based payment awards which require us to make significant estimates related to determining the value of our share based compensation 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
we granted  options during the year ended december  the assumptions used for determining the grant date fair value of options granted during the year ended december  are reflected in the following table year ended december  expected term of the options in years years expected volatility of company stock expected dividends none risk free interest rate expected forfeiture rate if factors change and we develop different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values of our share based compensation 
certain share based payment awards  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined using an established option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
in addition  we are required to net estimated forfeitures against compensation expense 
this requires us to estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
if actual forfeitures in future periods are different than our initial estimate  the compensation expense that we ultimately record may differ significantly from what was originally estimated 
the estimated forfeiture rate for unvested options outstanding as of december  range from to 
table of contents accounting for income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management 
such estimates and judgments include  but are not limited to  the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future  the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit 
as required by authoritative guidance  we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
authoritative guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   cumulative valuation allowances in the amount of  were recorded in connection with the net deferred income tax assets 
based on a review of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance  we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to  to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at december  we determined that it was appropriate to continue to provide a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of december  because of the losses we incurred during the year ended december  we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
to the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income  a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed 
such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and  for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises  an increase in shareholders equity 
as required by authoritative guidance  we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by the fasb  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
we have no recorded liability as of december  representing uncertain tax positions 
we have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense taken for stock options  certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
for us to realize the income tax benefit of these assets  we must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income tax purposes 
in some cases where deferred taxes were the result of compensation expense recognized on stock options  our ability to realize the income tax benefit of these assets is also dependent on our share price increasing to a point where these options have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value and are exercised 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets  we have evaluated our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets 
we continue to evaluate our ability to use recorded deferred income tax asset balances 
if we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years  no additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses  since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future 
therefore we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in future periods should our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized 
inflation and seasonality inflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year 
we do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature however  generally we generate higher revenues during the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half
