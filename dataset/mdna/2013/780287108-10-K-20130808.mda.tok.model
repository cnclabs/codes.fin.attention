item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  of this report 
part i item business overview royal gold  inc royal gold  the company  we  us  or our  together with its subsidiaries  is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metals royalties  precious metals streams and similar interests 
royalties are non operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs  if any 
we use the term royalty interest in this annual report on form k to refer to royalties  gold  silver or other metal stream interests  and other similar interests 
we seek to acquire existing royalty interests or to finance projects that are in production or in development stage in exchange for royalty interests 
in the ordinary course of business  we engage in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing royalty interests  to create new royalty interests through the financing of mine development or exploration  or to acquire companies that hold royalty interests 
we currently  and generally at any time  have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review  including  for example  our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities  analysis of technical  financial and other confidential information  submission of indications of interest  participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes 
as of june   the company owned royalty interests on producing properties  development stage properties and exploration stage properties  of which the company considers to be evaluation stage projects 
the company uses evaluation stage to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineralized material and on which operators are engaged in the development of reserves 
we do not conduct mining operations nor are we required to contribute to capital costs  exploration costs  environmental costs or mining  processing or other operating costs on the properties in which we hold royalty interests 
during the fiscal year ended june   we focused on the management of our existing royalty interests and the acquisition of royalty interests 
as discussed in further detail throughout this report  some significant developments to our business during fiscal year were as follows our royalty revenues increased to million  compared with million during fiscal year  we acquired the right to purchase an additional of the payable gold produced from the mt 
milligan copper gold project located in british columbia  canada  we sold  shares of our common stock  at a price of per share  resulting in proceeds of approximately million  we obtained the right to increase the net smelter return nsr royalty we may acquire on all the gold and silver production from seabridge gold  inc seabridge kerr sulphurets mitchell project ksm project in british columbia  canada by  and 
table of contents we increased our calendar year dividend to per basic share  which is paid in quarterly installments throughout calendar year this represents a increase compared with the dividend paid during calendar year certain definitions additional mineralized material additional mineralized material is that part of a mineral system that has potential economic significance but cannot be included in the proven and probable ore reserve estimates until further drilling and metallurgical work is completed  and until other economic and technical feasibility factors based upon such work have been resolved 
the securities and exchange commission the sec does not recognize this term 
investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves 
gross proceeds royalty gpr a royalty in which payments are made on contained ounces rather than recovered ounces 
gross smelter return gsr royalty a defined percentage of the gross revenue from a resource extraction operation  in certain cases reduced by certain contract defined costs paid by or charged to the operator 
g t a unit representing grams per tonne 
gold or silver stream a gold or silver purchase agreement that provides  in exchange for an upfront deposit payment  the right to purchase all or a portion of gold or silver  as applicable  produced from a mine  at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement 
net profits interest npi a defined percentage of the gross revenue from a resource extraction operation  after recovery of certain contract defined pre production costs  and after deduction of certain contract defined mining  milling  processing  transportation  administrative  marketing and other costs 
net smelter return nsr royalty a defined percentage of the gross revenue from a resource extraction operation  less a proportionate share of incidental transportation  insurance  refining and smelting costs 
net value royalty nvr a defined percentage of the gross revenue from a resource extraction operation  less certain contract defined transportation costs  milling costs and taxes 
proven measured reserves reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  and the grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling  and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size  shape  depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established 
probable indicated reserves reserves for which the quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance of probable indicated reserves  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation 
payable metal ounces or pounds of metal in concentrate payable to the operator after deduction of a percentage of metal in concentrate that is paid to a third party smelter pursuant to smelting contracts 
reserve that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 

table of contents royalty the right to receive a percentage or other denomination of mineral production from a resource extraction operation

recent business development proposed acquisition of the el morro royalty in august  royal gold  through its wholly owned chilean subsidiary  acquired a interest in a nsr royalty on certain portions of the el morro copper gold project in chile el morro  from xstrata copper chile sa  for million 
goldcorp inc goldcorp holds ownership of the el morro project and is the operator  with the remaining held by new gold inc new gold 
goldcorp and new gold reported that as of december   proven and probable reserves totaled million ounces of gold and billion pounds of copper on a basis 
this royalty encompasses some legacy bhp concessions that are currently estimated by royal gold to cover approximately one third of the total reserve 
goldcorp has indicated that all el morro project field construction activities have been suspended since april   pending the definition and implementation by the chilean environmental permitting authority the servicio de evaluaci n ambiental or sea of a community consultation process which corrects certain deficiencies in that process as specifically identified by the antofogasta court of appeals 
the chilean authorities and local communities continue to refine and advance this new consultation process with goldcorp support 
overall project activities are restricted to gathering information and engineering to support permit applications for submission following the completion of the administrative process and optimization of the project including securing a long term power supply 
fiscal business developments please refer to item  md a  for discussion on recent liquidity and capital resource developments 
acquisition of an additional royalty option on the kerr sulphurets mitchell project on december   royal gold purchased  common shares the additional seabridge shares of seabridge at a premium to the volume weighted average trading price of seabridge common shares on the toronto stock exchange tsx for a five day trading period that ended december   for million c million 
effective december   royal gold entered into an amendment the seabridge amendment to its option agreement with seabridge the seabridge option agreement to  among other things  remove the day minimum holding period applicable to the additional seabridge shares 
upon royal gold purchase of the additional seabridge shares  royal gold obtained the right  under the seabridge option agreement  as amended by the seabridge amendment  to increase the nsr royalty it may acquire on all of the gold and silver production from seabridge ksm project in british columbia  canada  by 
royal gold now holds the right to purchase either a nsr royalty on such production for c million  or a nsr royalty for c million 
if royal gold exercises its purchase right  the purchase price will be payable in three equal installments over the day period following exercise 
royal gold sold the additional seabridge shares in a private transaction to an unrelated party for million c million on december  
table of contents mt 
milligan iii gold stream acquisition on august   royal gold entered into an amendment to its purchase and sale agreement with thompson creek metals company inc thompson creek whereby royal gold  among other things  agreed to purchase an additional of the payable gold from the mt 
milligan copper gold project in exchange for a total of million  of which million was paid shortly after closing  and  when production is reached  cash payments for each payable ounce of gold delivered to royal gold  as discussed further below the milligan iii acquisition 
thompson creek intends to use the proceeds from the milligan iii acquisition to finance a portion of the construction of the mt 
milligan project and related costs 
under the milligan iii acquisition  royal gold increased its aggregate pre production commitment in the mt 
milligan project from million to million and agreed to purchase a total of of the payable ounces of gold produced from the mt 
milligan project at a cash purchase price equal to the lesser of  with no inflation adjustment  or the prevailing market price for each payable ounce of gold regardless of the number of payable ounces delivered to royal gold 
as of june   the company has paid million of the aggregate pre production commitment of million 
the final remaining scheduled quarterly payment of million is due september  royal gold obligation to make this quarterly payment is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions included in the agreement governing the milligan iii acquisition including that the aggregate amount of historical payments made by royal gold plus the final quarterly payment is less than the aggregate costs of developing the mt 
milligan project incurred or accrued by thompson creek as of the date of the quarterly payment 
mt 
milligan is an open pit copper gold project that thompson creek reports is in the advanced stages of construction and thompson creek estimates that commercial production will commence in the fourth quarter of calendar according to a national instrument technical report regarding the mt 
milligan project filed on the system for electronic document analysis and retrieval sedar under thompson creek profile on october   proven and probable reserves total million tonnes copper  g t gold  containing billion pounds of copper and million ounces of gold  which reserves are estimated to support a mine life of approximately years  with the project estimated to produce on average approximately  ounces of gold annually over the life of the mine  including estimated average production of  ounces of gold annually during the first six years of operation

table of contents please see operations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to many risks  which could decrease our revenues  under part i  item a  risk factors  of this report for a description of the risks attendant to foreign operations 
our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold and  to a lesser extent  the price of silver  copper and nickel  together with the amounts of production from our producing stage royalty interests 
the prices of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals have fluctuated widely in recent years 
the marketability and the price of metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond the control of the company and declines in the price of gold  silver  copper or nickel could have a material and adverse effect on the company results of operations and financial condition 
during the fiscal year ended june   we derived approximately of our royalty revenue from precious metals including from gold and from silver  from copper and from nickel 
competition the mining industry in general and the royalty segment in particular are competitive 
we compete with other royalty companies  mine operators  and financial buyers in efforts to acquire existing royalty interests and with the lenders  investors  and royalty and streaming companies providing financing to operators of mineral properties in our efforts to create new royalty interests 
many of our competitors in the lending and mining business are larger than we are and have greater resources and access to capital than we have 
key competitive factors in the royalty acquisition and financing business include the ability to identify and evaluate potential opportunities  transaction structure and consideration  and access to capital 
regulation like all mining operations  the operators of the mines that are subject to our royalties must comply with environmental laws and regulations promulgated by federal  state and local governments including  but not limited to  the national environmental policy act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the hazardous materials transportation act  and the toxic substances control act 
mines located on public lands in the united states are subject to the general mining law of the general mining law and are subject to comprehensive regulation by either the united states bureau of land management an agency of the united states department of the interior or the united states forest service an agency of the united states department of agriculture 
the mines also are subject to regulations of the united states environmental protection agency epa  the united states mine safety and health administration and similar state and local agencies 
operators of mines that are subject to our royalty interests in other countries are obligated to comply with similar laws and regulations in those jurisdictions 
although we are not responsible as a royalty interest owner for ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations  failure by the operators of the mines on which we have royalty interests to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permits can result in injunctive action  damages and civil and criminal penalties on the operators which could reduce or eliminate production from the mines and thereby reduce or eliminate the royalties we receive and negatively affect our financial condition

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
the market or trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks 
in addition  please see our note about forward looking statements included in part ii  item  md a of this annual report on form k 
please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 
risks related to our business volatility in gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metal prices may have an adverse impact on the value of our royalty interests and may reduce our revenues 
certain contracts governing our royalty interests have features that may amplify the negative effects of a drop in metals prices 
the profitability of our royalty interests is directly related to the market price of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals 
our revenue is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of gold  as gold royalty interests represent the majority of our royalty revenue 
market prices may fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of royal gold or any mining company  including metal supply  industrial and jewelry fabrication  investment demand  central banking economic policy  expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  the relative strength of the dollar and other currencies  interest rates  gold purchases  sales and loans by central banks  forward sales by metal producers  global or regional political  economic or banking conditions  and a number of other factors 
declines in market prices for gold  silver  copper  nickel and certain other metals such as those experienced during the first half of calendar  decrease our revenues 
severe declines in market 
table of contents prices could cause an operator to reduce  suspend or terminate production from an operating project or construction work at a development project  which may result in a temporary or permanent reduction or cessation of revenue from those projects  and we might not be able to recover the initial investment in our royalty interests 
our sliding scale royalties  such as cortez  holt  mulatos  wolverine and other properties  amplify this effect  because when metal prices fall below certain thresholds in a sliding scale royalty  a lower royalty rate is applied to production 
any such price decline may result in a material and adverse effect on our profitability  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the selection of a property for exploration or development  the determination to construct a mine and place it into production  and the dedication of funds necessary to achieve such purposes are decisions that must be made long before the first revenues from production will be received 
price fluctuations between the time that decisions about exploration  development and construction are made and the commencement of production can have a material adverse effect on the economics of a mine and can eliminate or have a material adverse impact on the value of royalty interests 
moreover  certain agreements governing our royalty interests  such as those relating to our royalty interests in the andacollo  robinson  pe asquito and voisey bay properties  are based on the operator concentrate sales to smelters  which include price adjustments between the operator and the smelter based on metals prices at a later date  typically three to five months after shipment to the smelter 
in such cases  our payments from the operator include a component of these later price adjustments  which can result in decreased revenue in later periods if metals prices have fallen 
volatility in gold  silver  copper and nickel prices is demonstrated by the annual high and low prices for those metals from selected calendar years during the past decade 
high and low gold prices per ounce  based on the london bullion market association pm fix  have ranged from to in  from to in  from  to in  from  to  in  from  to  in  and from  to  year to date high and low silver prices per ounce  based on the london bullion market association fix  have ranged from to in  from to in  from to in  from to in  from to in  and from to year to date high and low copper prices per pound  based on the london metal exchange cash settlement price for grade a copper  have ranged from to in  from to in  from to in  from to in  from to in  and from to year to date high and low nickel prices per pound  based on the london metal exchange cash settlement price for nickel  have ranged from to in  from to in  from to in  from to in  from to in  and from to year to date we own passive interests in mining properties  and it is difficult or impossible for us to ensure properties are developed or operated in our best interest 
all of our current revenue is derived from royalty interests on properties operated by third parties 
the holder of a royalty interest typically has no authority regarding the development or operation of a mineral property 
therefore  we are not in control of decisions regarding development or operation of any of the properties on which we hold a royalty interest  and we have limited legal rights to influence those decisions 

table of contents our strategy of having others operate properties on which we retain a royalty interest puts us generally at risk to the decisions of others regarding all operating matters  including permitting  feasibility analysis  mine design and operation  processing  plant and equipment matters and temporary or permanent suspension of operations  among others 
these decisions are likely to be motivated by the best interests of the operator rather than to maximize payments to us 
although we attempt to secure contractual rights when we create new royalty interests  such as audit or access rights  that will permit us to protect our interests to a degree  there can be no assurance that such rights will always be available or sufficient  or that our efforts will be successful in achieving timely or favorable results or in affecting the operation of the properties in which we have a royalty interest in ways that would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our revenues are subject to operational and other risks faced by operators of our mining properties 
although we are not required to pay capital costs except for transactions where we finance mine development or operating costs  our financial results are indirectly subject to hazards and risks normally associated with developing and operating mining properties where we hold royalty interests 
some of these risks include insufficient ore reserves  increases in production or capital costs incurred by operators or third parties that may impact the amount of reserves available to be mined  cause an operator to delay or curtail mining development and operations or render mining of ore uneconomical and cause an operator to close operations  declines in the price of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals  mine operating and ore processing facility problems  economic downturns and operators insufficient financing  insolvency or bankruptcy of the operator  significant permitting  environmental and other regulatory requirements and restrictions and any changes in those regulations  challenges by non mining interests to existing permits and mining rights  and to applications for permits and mining rights  community or civil unrest  labor shortages  increased labor costs  and labor disputes  strikes or work stoppages at mines  unanticipated geological conditions or metallurgical characteristics unanticipated ground or water conditions  pit wall or tailings dam failures or any underground stability issues  fires  explosions and other industrial accidents  environmental hazards and natural catastrophes such as floods  earthquakes or inclement or hazardous weather conditions  injury to persons  property or the environment  the ability of operators to maintain or increase production or to replace reserves as properties are mined  and uncertain domestic and foreign political and economic environments 
the occurrence of any of the above mentioned risks or hazards could result in an interruption  suspension or termination of operations or development work at any of the properties in which we hold a royalty interest and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 

table of contents acquired royalty interests  particularly on development stage properties  are subject to the risk that they may not produce anticipated revenues 
the royalty interests we acquire may not produce anticipated revenues 
the success of our acquisitions of royalty interests is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation  timing and amount of revenues to be derived from our royalty interests  particularly with respect to acquisitions of royalty interests on development stage properties 
if an operator does not bring a property into production and operate in accordance with feasibility studies  technical or reserve reports or other plans due to lack of capital  inexperience  unexpected problems  delays  or otherwise  then the acquired royalty interest may not yield sufficient revenues to be profitable 
furthermore  operators of development stage properties must obtain and maintain all necessary environmental permits and access to water  power and other raw materials needed to begin production  and there can be no assurance that operators will be able to do so 
the mt 
milligan mining project in canada and the pascua lama mining project in chile and argentina are among our principal development stage acquisitions 
construction work is nearing completion at mt 
milligan  and thompson creek expects to commission the project in august however  construction activities on the chilean side of barrick pascua lama mining project are currently suspended pursuant to a court ruling while barrick addresses environmental and other regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of chilean authorities 
barrick has submitted a plan for review by the regulators to construct a water management system in compliance with permit conditions for completion by the end of  after which it expects to resume the remaining construction work in chile 
barrick intends to re sequence construction of the process plant and other facilities in argentina in order to target first production by mid barrick expects capital costs for this project to total to billion  though barrick has stated that it is unable to fully assess the impact on the overall capital budget  operating costs and schedule of the pascua lama project until the regulatory and legal issues are clarified 
the failure of the mt 
milligan or pascua lama project  or any of our other principal properties  to produce anticipated revenues on schedule or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition or the other benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition of royalty interests 
further  as mines on which we have royalty interests mature  we can expect overall declines in production over the years unless operators are able to replace reserves that are mined through mine expansion or successful new exploration 
there can be no assurance that the operators of properties where we hold royalty interests will be able to maintain or increase production or replace reserves as they are mined 
several of our royalty interests are significant to us and any adverse development related to these properties could adversely affect our revenues 
our investments in the andacollo  voisey bay and pe asquito properties are currently significant to us  as our royalty interests in these properties resulted in approximately million in revenue in fiscal year  which was nearly of our revenue for the period 
in addition  we anticipate the mt 
milligan and pascua lama mining projects to contribute significantly to our revenues if and when they begin producing streaming or royalty revenues  respectively 
any adverse development affecting the operation of or production from these operations may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  we have limited or no control over operational decisions made by third party operators of these projects 
any adverse decision made by the operators  such as changes to mine plans  production schedules or metallurgical processes  may impact the timing and amount of revenue that we receive 

table of contents potential litigation affecting the properties that we have royalty interests in could have an adverse effect on us 
potential litigation may arise between the operators of properties on which we have royalty interests and third parties 
as holder of a royalty interest  we generally will not have any influence on the litigation and generally will not have access to non public information concerning such litigation 
any such litigation that results in the reduction  cessation or termination of production from a property  whether temporary or permanent  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we depend on our operators for the calculation of payments of our royalty interests 
we may not be able to detect errors and later payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments 
the payments of our royalty interests are calculated by the operators of the properties on which we have royalty interests based on their reported production 
each operator calculation of our payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its production and accounting functions  and  given the complex nature of mining and ownership of mining interests  errors may occur from time to time in the allocation of production and the various other calculations made by an operator 
any of these errors may render calculations of such payments inaccurate 
certain agreements governing our royalty interests require the operators to provide us with production and operating information that may  depending on the completeness and accuracy of such information  enable us to detect errors in the calculation of payments of royalty interests that we receive 
we do not  however  have the contractual right to receive production information for all of our royalty interests 
as a result  our ability to detect payment errors through our royalty interest monitoring program and its associated internal controls and procedures is limited  and the possibility exists that we will need to make retroactive revenue adjustments 
some contracts governing our royalty interests provide us the right to audit the operational calculations and production data for the associated payments of royalty interests  however  such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the revenue and may require us to adjust our revenue in later periods  which could require us to restate our financial statements 
development and operation of mines is very capital intensive and any inability of the operators of properties where we hold royalty interests to meet liquidity needs  obtain financing or operate profitably could have material adverse effects on the value of and revenue from our royalty interests 
the development and operation of mines is very capital intensive  and if operators of properties where we hold royalty interests do not have the financial strength or sufficient credit or other financing capability to cover the costs of developing or operating a mine  the operator may curtail  delay or cease development or operations at a mine site 
operators ability to raise and service sufficient capital may be affected by  among other things  macroeconomic conditions  future commodity prices of metals to be mined  or further economic volatility in the us and global financial markets as has been experienced in recent years 
if any of the operators of the properties on which we have royalty interests suffer these material adverse effects  then our royalty interests and the value of and revenue from our royalty interests may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  continued economic volatility or a credit crisis could adversely affect the ability of operators to obtain debt or equity financing for the exploration  development and operation of their properties 
certain of our royalty interests are subject to payment or production caps or rights in favor of the operator or third parties that could reduce the revenues generated from the royalty interest 
some of our principal royalty interests are subject to limitations  such that the royalty interest will extinguish after threshold production is achieved or payments at stated thresholds are made 
for example  a portion of our royalty at pascua lama and our royalty at mulatos are subject to production caps 
furthermore  certain other agreements governing our royalty interests contain rights that favor the operator or third parties 
for example  in fiscal year  osisko  the operator of canadian 
table of contents malartic  one of our principal producing properties  exercised its buy down right that reduced our royalty from a nsr royalty to a nsr royalty 
also  certain individuals from whom we purchased portions of our royalties at pascua lama are entitled to one time payments if the price of gold exceeds certain thresholds 
if any of these thresholds are met or similar rights are exercised or we fail to make the required payment  our future revenue could be reduced 
we may enter into acquisitions or other material transactions at any time 
in the ordinary course of business  we engage in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing royalty interests  to create new royalty interests through the financing of mining projects or to acquire companies that hold royalty interests 
we currently  and generally at any time  have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review  including  for example  our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities  technical  financial and other confidential information  submission of indications of interest and participation in discussions or negotiations for acquisitions 
we also often consider obtaining or providing debt commitments for acquisition financing 
any such acquisition could be material to us 
we could issue common stock or incur additional indebtedness to fund our acquisitions 
issuances of common stock may dilute existing stockholders and reduce some or all of our financial measures on a per share basis 
in addition  any such acquisition or other transaction may have other transaction specific risks associated with it  including risks related to the completion of the transaction  the project  its operators  or the jurisdictions in which the project is located 
in addition  we may consider opportunities to restructure our royalty interests where we believe such restructuring would provide a long term benefit to the company  though such restructuring may reduce near term revenues or result in the incurrence of transaction related costs 
we could enter into one or more acquisition or restructuring transactions at any time 
we may be unable to successfully acquire additional royalty interests at appropriate valuations 
our future success largely depends upon our ability to acquire royalty interests at appropriate valuations  including through royalty interest and corporate acquisitions and other financing transactions 
most of our revenues are derived from royalty interests that we acquire or finance  rather than through exploration of properties 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and complete the acquisition of such royalty interests or businesses that own desired interests  at reasonable prices or on favorable terms  or  if necessary  that we will have  or be able to obtain  sufficient financing on reasonable terms to complete such acquisitions 
continued economic volatility or a credit crisis could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing for acquisitions of additional royalty interests 
in addition  we face competition in the acquisition of royalty interests 
we have competitors that are engaged in the acquisition of royalty interests  including companies with greater financial resources  and we may not be able to compete successfully against these companies in acquiring new royalty interests 
if we are unable to successfully acquire additional royalty interests  the reserves subject to our royalty interests will decline as the producing properties on which we have such royalty interests are mined or payment or production caps on certain of our royalty interests are met 
we also may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or operators of properties on which we seek royalty interests if we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions of royalty interests or businesses that own desired royalty interests 
each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
estimates of reserves and mineralization by the operators of mines in which we have royalty interests are subject to significant revision 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable reserves and mineralization  including many factors beyond our control and the control of the operators of properties in which we have royalty interests 
reserve estimates for our royalty interests are prepared 
table of contents by the operators of the mining properties 
we do not participate in the preparation or verification of such reports and have not independently assessed or verified the accuracy of such information 
the estimation of reserves and of other mineralized material is a subjective process  and the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  metallurgical testing and production  and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate  may cause a revision of such estimates 
the volume and grade of reserves recovered and rates of production may be less than anticipated 
assumptions about gold and other precious metal prices are subject to great uncertainty  and such prices have fluctuated widely in the past 
declines in the market price of gold  silver  copper  nickel or other metals also may render reserves or mineralized material containing relatively lower ore grades uneconomical to exploit 
changes in operating costs and other factors including short term operating factors  the processing of new or different ore grades  geotechnical characteristics and metallurgical recovery  may materially and adversely affect reserves 
finally  it is important to note that our royalty interests generally give us interests in only a small portion of the production from the operators aggregate reserves  and the size of those interests varies widely based on the individual documents governing the royalty interest 
estimates of production by the operators of mines in which we have royalty interests are subject to change  and actual production may vary materially from such estimates 
production estimates are prepared by the operators of mining properties 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating anticipated production attributable to our royalty interests  including many factors beyond our control and the control of the operators of the properties in which we have royalty interests 
we do not participate in the preparation or verification of production estimates and have not independently assessed or verified the accuracy of such information 
the estimation of anticipated production is a subjective process and the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quality of available data  reliability of production history  variability in grade encountered  mechanical or other problems encountered  engineering and geological interpretation and operator judgment 
rates of production may be less than expected 
results of drilling  metallurgical testing and production  changes in commodity prices  and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate may cause actual production to vary materially from such estimates 
if title to properties is not properly maintained by the operators  or is successfully challenged by third parties  our royalty interests could become invalid 
our business includes the risk that operators of mining projects and holders of mining claims  tenements  concessions  mining licenses or other interests in land and mining rights may lose their exploration or mining rights  or have their rights to mining properties contested by private parties or the government 
internationally  mining tenures are subject to loss for many reasons  including expiration  failure of the holder to meet specific legal qualifications  failure to pay maintenance fees  reduction in geographic extent upon passage of time or upon conversion from an exploration tenure to a mining tenure  failure of title and similar risks 
unpatented mining claims  for example  which constitute a significant portion of the properties on which we hold royalty interests in the united states  and which are generally considered subject to greater title risk than real property interests held by absolute title  are often uncertain and subject to contest by third parties and the government 
if title to unpatented mining claims or other mining tenures subject to our royalty interests has not been properly established or is not properly maintained  or is successfully contested  our royalty interests could be adversely affected 

table of contents royalty interests are subject to title and other defects and contest by operators of mining projects and holders of mining rights  and these risks may be hard to identify in acquisition transactions 
while we seek to confirm the existence  validity  enforceability and geographic extent of the royalty interests we acquire  there can be no assurance that disputes over these and other matters will not arise 
confirming these matters  as well as the title to mining property on which we hold or seek to acquire a royalty interest  is a complex matter  and is subject to the application of the laws of each jurisdiction to the particular circumstances of each parcel of mining property 
similarly  our royalty interests generally are subject to uncertainties and complexities arising from the application of contract and property laws governing private parties and or local or national governments in the jurisdiction where mining projects are located 
furthermore  royalty interests in many jurisdictions are contractual in nature  rather than interests in land  and therefore may be subject to change of control  bankruptcy or insolvency of operators  nonperformance and to challenges of various kinds brought by operators or third parties 
we often do not have the protection of security interests over property that we could liquidate to recover all or part of our investment in a royalty interest 
even if we retain our royalty interests in a mining project after any change of control  bankruptcy or insolvency of the operator  the project may end up under the control of a new operator  who may or may not operate the project in a similar manner to the current operator  which may positively or negatively impact us 
in addition  operators and other parties to the agreements governing our royalty interests may not abide by their contractual obligations and we could be forced to take legal action to enforce our contractual rights 
disputes also could arise challenging  among other things  the existence or geographic extent of the royalty interest  third party claims to the same royalty interest or to the property on which we have a royalty interest  various rights of the operator or third parties in or to the royalty interest  methods for calculating the royalty interest  production and other thresholds and caps applicable to payments of royalty interests  the obligation of an operator to make payments of royalty interests  and various defects or ambiguities in the agreement governing a royalty interest 
unknown defects in  non performance of  or disputes relating to  the royalty interests we acquire may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits from the acquisition  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
operations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to many risks  which could decrease our revenues 
we derived approximately of our revenues from foreign sources during fiscal year  compared to approximately in fiscal year and in fiscal year our principal producing royalty interests on properties outside of the united states are located in canada  chile  mexico and spain 
we currently have royalty interests in mines and projects in other countries  including argentina  australia  bolivia  brazil  burkina faso  colombia  dominican republic  finland  ghana  guatemala  honduras  nicaragua  peru  russia and tunisia 
in addition  future acquisitions may expose us to new jurisdictions 
our foreign activities are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries 
these risks include  depending on the country  such things as expropriation or nationalization of property  exchange and currency controls and fluctuations  limitations on foreign exchange and repatriation of earnings  increased foreign taxation or imposition of new or increased mining royalty interests  restrictions on mineral production and price controls  import and export regulations  including restrictions on the export of gold  silver  copper  nickel or other metals  
table of contents changes in legislation  including changes related to taxation  royalty interests  imports  exports  duties  currency  foreign ownership  foreign trade and foreign investment  high rates of inflation  labor practices and disputes  enforcement of unfamiliar or uncertain foreign real estate  mineral tenure  contract  water use  mine safety and environmental laws and policies  challenges to mining  processing and related permits and licenses  or to applications for permits and licenses  by or on behalf of regulatory authorities  indigenous populations  non governmental organizations or other third parties  renegotiation  nullification or forced modification of existing contracts  licenses  permits  approvals  concessions or the like  war  crime  terrorism  sabotage  civil unrest and uncertain political and economic environments  corruption  exposure to liabilities under anti corruption and anti money laundering laws  including the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions to which we  but not necessarily our competitors  may be subject  suspension of the enforcement of creditors rights and stockholders rights  risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health issues  and loss of access to government controlled infrastructure  such as roads  bridges  rails  ports  power sources and water supply 
for example  in recent years argentina  where a portion of the pascua lama project is located  has experienced significant economic turmoil and its government has taken several actions that have troubled foreign investors  including the nationalization of ypf sa  the largest oil and gas company in argentina  from foreign owner repsol sa and the enactment of a federal glacier protection law that restricts mining activities in areas on or near the nation glaciers as discussed below in the mining industry is subject to significant environmental risks 
our royalties in the pascua lama project  which straddles the border between chile and argentina  are on the chilean side of the project 
these actions  or similar future actions  could have a material adverse effect on the feasibility of new mine development and the profitability of existing mining operations in argentina 
in addition  the pascua lama project has been challenged by chilean indigenous groups  and construction activities on the chilean side of the pascua lama project are currently suspended pursuant to a court ruling while barrick addresses environmental and other regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of chilean authorities  as discussed further in part i  item  properties under the heading pascua lama project region iii  chile 
as another example  in march  the australian federal government adopted new tax legislation that imposes a tax on iron ore and coal mine profits 
similar legislation could be adopted in other foreign jurisdictions that could impose new or larger tax obligations or royalty interests on operators 
such legislation could have a material adverse effect on the feasibility of new mine development and the profitability of existing mining operations 
in addition  many of our operators are organized outside of the united states 
our royalty interests may be subject to the application of foreign laws to our operators  and their stockholders  including laws relating to foreign ownership structures  corporate transactions  creditors rights  bankruptcy and liquidation 
foreign operations also could be adversely impacted by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  investment and taxation 

table of contents these risks may limit or disrupt operating mines or projects on which we hold royalty interests  restrict the movement of funds  or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
certain of these risks may increase in an environment of relatively high metal prices 
changes in us federal and state legislation  including changes in mining taxes and royalty interests payable to governments  could decrease our revenues 
a number of properties where we hold royalty interests are located on us public lands that are subject to federal mining and other public land laws 
changes in federal or state laws or the regulations promulgated under them could affect mine development and expansion  significantly increase regulatory obligations and compliance costs with respect to mine development and mine operations  increase the cost of holding mining claims or impose additional taxes on mining operations  all of which could adversely affect our revenue from such properties 
in recent years  the united states congress has considered a number of proposed major revisions to the general mining law  which governs the creation  maintenance and possession of mining claims and related activities on public lands in the united states 
congress also has recently considered bills  which if enacted  would impose royalty interests payable to the government on hardrock production  increase land holding fees  impose federal reclamation fees  impose additional environmental operating standards and afford greater public involvement and regulatory discretion in the mine permitting process 
such legislation  if enacted  could adversely affect the development of new mines and the expansion of existing mines  as well as increase the cost of all mining operations on public lands  and could materially and adversely affect mine operators and our revenue from mines located on public lands in the united states 
the mining industry is subject to significant environmental risks 
mining is subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production 
laws and regulations in the united states and abroad intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing and evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement  larger fines and liability  and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
furthermore  mining may be subject to significant environmental and other permitting requirements regarding the use of raw materials needed for operations  particularly water and power 
compliance with such laws and regulations can require significant expenditures and a breach may result in the imposition of fines and penalties  which may be material 
if an operator is forced to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations or becomes subject to environmental restrictions that limit its ability to continue or expand operations  or if an operator were to lose its right to use or access water or other raw materials necessary to operate a mine  our revenues could be reduced  delayed or eliminated 
these risks are most salient with regard to our development stage properties where permitting may not be complete and or where new legislation and regulation can lead to delays  interruptions and significant unexpected cost burdens for mine operators 
for example  argentina recently passed a federal glacier protection law that restricts mining activities in areas on or near the nation glaciers 
we have royalties on the chilean side of the pascua lama project  which straddles the border between chile and argentina  and the glacier law could affect aspects of the design  development and operation of the pascua lama project 
in july  the national supreme court of justice of argentina overturned preliminary injunctions suspending the application of the glacier law in the san juan province  where a portion of the pascua lama project is located  but the supreme court must still rule on the constitutionality of the glacier law 
further  to the extent that we become subject to environmental liabilities for the time period during which we were operating properties  the satisfaction of any liabilities would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 

table of contents regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs to the operators of the properties on which we have royalty interests 
a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change 
the december kyoto protocol  which has been extended to  establishes a set of greenhouse gas emission targets for countries that have ratified the protocol  which include ghana  australia and peru 
canada ratified the protocol but renounced its ratification in december furthermore  the us congress and several states have initiated legislation regarding climate change that will affect energy prices and demand for carbon intensive products 
additionally  the australian government recently implemented a national emissions trading scheme and renewable energy targets 
legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on the operators of properties where we hold royalty interests  including increased energy  capital equipment  environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations 
if an operator of a property on which we have a royalty interest is forced to incur significant costs to comply with climate change regulation or becomes subject to environmental restrictions that limit its ability to continue or expand operations  our revenues from that property could be reduced  delayed or eliminated 
we depend on the services of our president and chief executive officer and other key employees and on the participation of our chairman 
we believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key executive management personnel 
tony jensen has served as our president and chief executive officer since july mr 
jensen extensive commercial experience  mine operations background and industry contacts give us an important competitive advantage 
furthermore  our chairman  stanley dempsey  who served as our executive chairman until his retirement as an officer of the company in january  has extensive knowledge of the royalty business and maintains long standing relationships with the mining industry  both of which are important to our success 
the loss of the services of mr 
jensen  other key members of management or other key employees could jeopardize our ability to maintain our competitive position in the industry 
from time to time  we may also need to identify and retain additional skilled management and specialized technical personnel to efficiently operate our business 
the number of persons skilled in the acquisition  exploration and development of royalty interests is limited and competition for such persons is intense 
recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our success and there can be no assurance of such success 
if we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel  our ability to execute our business model and growth strategy could be affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we currently do not have key person life insurance for any of our officers or directors 
our disclosure controls and internal control over our financial reporting are subject to inherent limitations 
management has concluded that as of june   our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were effective 
such controls and procedures  however  may not be adequate to prevent or identify existing or future internal control weaknesses due to inherent limitations therein  which may be beyond our control  including  but not limited to  our dependence on operators for the calculation of payments of royalty interests as discussed above in we depend on our operators for the calculation of payments of our royalty interests 
we may not be able to detect errors and later payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments 
given our dependence on third party calculations  there is a risk that material misstatements in results of operations and financial condition may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our internal controls over financial reporting and may require us to restate our financial statements 

table of contents we have incurred indebtedness in connection with our business and could incur additional indebtedness that could limit cash flow available for our operations  limit our ability to borrow additional funds and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
as of june   we had million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes outstanding  which we incurred in june in addition  we may incur additional indebtedness in connection with financing acquisitions  strategic transactions or for other purposes 
as of june   we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
our indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate enough cash to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness 
our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions of royalty interests  working capital  pay dividends and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  restrict us from exploiting business opportunities  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness  dilute our existing stockholders if we elect to issue common stock instead of paying cash in the event the holders convert the notes  or any other convertible securities issued in the future  require the consent of our existing lenders to borrow additional funds  as was required in connection with the issuance of the notes  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes 
in addition  the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains  and the agreements that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain  financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
among other restrictions  the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting our ability to make certain investments  consummate certain mergers  incur certain debt or liens and dispose of assets 
we may be required to pay a significant amount of money or issue a significant amount of shares of our common stock or both upon the exercise of any put  redemption or call right and conversion of the notes  which could dilute existing stockholders and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding march   but only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after june  and only during such fiscal quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days whether or not consecutive during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of 
table of contents the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day  during the five consecutive business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each trading day of such measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day  upon the occurrence of certain corporate events  or if we call any notes for redemption  at any time until the close of business on the business day preceding the redemption date 
on or after march  until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding june   the maturity date  holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
on or after june   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days whether or not consecutive during the period of consecutive trading days ending within trading days immediately prior to the date we provide the notice of redemption exceeds of the applicable conversion price of the notes on each applicable trading day  subject to certain limited exceptions  we may redeem any or all of the notes 
the redemption price for the notes to be redeemed on any redemption date will equal of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the redemption date  plus per each  principal amount of notes being redeemed 
if we call any notes for redemption  holders may convert their notes at any time until the close of business on the business day preceding the redemption date 
upon conversion of any of the notes  whether upon maturity  the exercise of any put  call or redemption right  or otherwise  we will be required to pay or deliver  at our election  cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
any such payment or delivery of cash  shares or a combination of cash and shares upon conversion of the notes could dilute existing stockholders and may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the risk that we will be unable to refinance our indebtedness when it becomes due  or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our indebtedness 
as of june   our annual debt service obligation on the notes was approximately million 
in addition  the notes include provisions providing for the lump sum payment of significant amounts of principal  whether upon maturity  upon the exercise of any applicable put  redemption or call rights or otherwise and all amounts  if any  due under our revolving credit facility are due at maturity 
our ability to make these payments when due will depend upon several factors  which may not be in our control 
these factors include our liquidity or our ability to liquidate assets owned by us on or prior to such put  redemption  call or maturity dates and the amount by which we have been able to reduce indebtedness prior to such date though exchanges  refinancing  extensions  collateralization or other similar transactions any of which transactions may also have the effect of reducing liquidity or liquid assets 
if we are unable to maintain cash reserves or generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we fail to comply with the various covenants and requirements of the notes  our revolving credit facility or any indebtedness which we may incur in the future  this could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 
any default under the notes  our revolving credit facility or any indebtedness which we may incur in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 

table of contents the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash  such as the notes  could have a material effect on our reported net income  net working capital or other financial results 
under the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification section  debt with conversion and other options asc  an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer economic interest cost 
the effect of asc on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid in capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes 
as a result  we are required to record a greater amount of non cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes 
we report lower net income in our financial results because asc will require interest to include both the current period amortization of the debt discount and the instrument coupon interest  which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results  the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes 
in addition  under certain circumstances  convertible debt instruments such as the notes that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method  the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount 
under the treasury stock method  for diluted earnings per share purposes  the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess  if we elected to settle such excess in shares  are issued 
we cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method 
if we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes  then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may continue to be volatile and could decline 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may decline in the future 
the high and low sale prices of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market were and for the fiscal year ended june   and for the fiscal year ended june   and and for the fiscal year ended june  the fluctuation of the market price of our common stock has been affected by many factors that are beyond our control  including market prices of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals  interest rates  expectations regarding inflation  ability of operators to advance development projects  produce precious metals and develop new reserves  currency values  credit market conditions  general stock market conditions  and global and regional political and economic conditions 

table of contents additional issuances of equity securities by us could dilute our existing stockholders  reduce some or all of our financial measures on a per share basis  reduce the trading price of our common stock or impede our ability to raise future capital 
substantial sales of shares may negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
we may issue equity in the future in connection with acquisitions  strategic transactions or for other purposes 
to the extent we issue additional equity securities  our existing stockholders could be diluted and some or all of our financial measures on a per share basis could be reduced 
in addition  the shares of common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions 
the market price of our common stock could decline if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued upon the conversion of the outstanding notes or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner 
in addition  the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 
these sales also could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
conversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders 
at our election  we may settle the notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock 
an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock are issuable upon conversion of the outstanding notes at the initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
in addition  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes  and therefore the dilution of existing common stockholders  could increase under certain circumstances described in the indenture under which the notes are governed 
we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders 
as a result  the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
we may change our practice of paying dividends 
we have paid a cash dividend on our common stock for each fiscal year beginning in fiscal year our board of directors has discretion in determining whether to declare a dividend based on a number of factors  including prevailing gold prices  economic market conditions  future earnings  cash flows  financial condition  and funding requirements for future opportunities or operations 
in addition  there may be corporate law limitations or future contractual restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
if our board of directors declines or is unable to declare dividends in the future or reduces the current dividend level  our stock price could fall  and the success of an investment in our common stock would depend largely upon any future stock price appreciation 
we have increased our dividends in prior years 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to do so or that we will pay any dividends at all 
certain provisions of delaware law  our organizational documents  our rights plan and the indenture governing the notes could impede  delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us 
certain provisions of delaware law  our organizational documents  our rights plans and the indenture governing the notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
delaware law prohibits  subject to certain exceptions  a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with 
table of contents any interested stockholder  which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of or more of a delaware corporation voting stock  for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
additionally  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could similarly delay  defer or discourage a change in control of us or management 
these provisions could also discourage a proxy contest and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
such provisions provide for the following  among other things i the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval  ii the ability of our board of directors to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued preferred stock  iii a board of directors divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three year terms  iv permitting only the chairman of the board of directors  chief executive officer  president or board of directors to call a stockholders meeting and v requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals and related information 
furthermore  we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the stockholder rights plan could cause significant dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
in addition  if an acquisition event constitutes a fundamental change  holders of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash 
if an acquisition event constitutes a make whole fundamental change  we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such make whole fundamental change 
these provisions could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline

set forth below are the definitions of proven and probable reserves used by the us securities and exchange commission 
reserve is that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
proven measured reserves are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  and the grade is computed from the results of detailed sampling  and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that the size  shape  depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established 
probable indicated reserves are reserves for which the quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance of probable indicated reserves  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume geological continuity between points of observation

royal gold does not reconcile the reserve estimates provided by the operators with definitions of reserves used by the us securities and exchange commission 
the reserves reported are either estimates received from the various operators or are based on documentation material provided to royal gold or which is derived from recent publicly available information from the operators of the various properties or various recent national instrument or jorc code reports filed by operators

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview royal gold  together with its subsidiaries  is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metals royalties  precious metals streams and similar interests 
royalties are non operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs  if any 
we use the term royalty interest in this annual report on form k to refer to royalties  gold  silver or other metal stream interests  and other similar interests 
we seek to acquire existing royalty interests or to finance projects that are in production or in development stage in exchange for royalty interests 
in the ordinary course of business  we engage in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing royalty interests  to create new royalty interests through the financing of mine development or exploration  or to acquire companies that hold royalty interests 
we currently  and generally at any time  have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review  including  for example  our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities  analysis of technical  financial and other confidential information  submission of 
table of contents indications of interest  participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes 
as of june   the company owned royalties on producing properties  development stage properties and exploration stage properties  of which the company considers to be evaluation stage projects 
the company uses evaluation stage to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineralized material and on which operators are engaged in the development of reserves 
we do not conduct mining operations nor are we required to contribute to capital costs  exploration costs  environmental costs or other mining  processing or other operating costs on the properties in which we hold royalty interests 
during the fiscal year ended june   we focused on the management of our existing royalty interests and the acquisition of royalty interests 
our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold and  to a lesser extent  the price of silver  copper and nickel  together with the amounts of production from our producing stage royalty interests 
the price of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals have fluctuated widely in recent years and most recently have experienced declines from highs experienced in the first half of our fiscal year the marketability and the price of metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond the control of the company and significant declines in the price of gold  silver  copper or nickel could have a material and adverse effect on the company results of operations and financial condition 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  gold  silver  copper and nickel price averages and percentage of royalty revenues by metal were as follows fiscal year ended june  june  june  metal average price percentage of royalty revenue average price percentage of royalty revenue average price percentage of royalty revenue gold ounce silver ounce copper pound nickel pound other n a n a n a operators production estimates by royalty for calendar year we received annual production estimates from many of the operators of our producing mines during the first calendar quarter of the following table shows such production estimates for our principal producing properties for calendar as well as the actual production reported to us by the various operators through june  the estimates and production reports are prepared by the operators of the mining properties

historical production relates to the amount of metal sales  subject to our royalty interests for each fiscal year presented  as reported to us by the operators of the mines 
critical accounting policies listed below are the accounting policies that the company believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

table of contents our most critical accounting estimates relate to our assumptions regarding future gold  silver  nickel  copper and other metal prices and the estimates of reserves and recoveries of third party mine operators 
we rely on reserve estimates reported by the operators on the properties in which we have royalty interests 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we charge depreciation  depletion and amortization to earnings 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions  however  actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
royalty interests in mineral properties royalty interests in mineral properties include acquired royalty interests in production  development and exploration stage properties 
the costs of acquired royalty interests in mineral properties are capitalized as tangible assets as such interests do not meet the definition of a financial asset under the accounting standards codification asc guidance 
acquisition costs of production stage royalty interests are depleted using the units of production method over the life of the mineral property  which is estimated using proven and probable reserves as provided by the operator 
acquisition costs of royalty interests on development stage mineral properties  which are not yet in production  are not amortized until the property begins production 
acquisition costs of royalty interests on exploration stage mineral properties  where there are no proven and probable reserves  are not amortized 
at such time as the associated exploration stage mineral interests are converted to proven and probable reserves  the cost basis is amortized over the remaining life of the mineral property  using proven and probable reserves 
the carrying values of exploration stage mineral interests are evaluated for impairment at such time as information becomes available indicating that the production will not occur in the future 
exploration costs are expensed when incurred 
asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in production and development stage mineral properties is evaluated based upon estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from each royalty interest property using estimates of proven and probable reserves and other relevant information received from the operators 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in exploration stage mineral properties in the event of significant decreases in the price of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metals  and whenever new information regarding the mineral properties is obtained from the operator indicating that production will not likely occur or may be reduced in the future  thus affecting the future recoverability of our royalty interests 
impairments in the carrying value of each property are measured and recorded to the extent that the carrying value in each property exceeds its estimated fair value  which is generally calculated using estimated future discounted cash flows 
our estimates of gold  silver  copper  nickel and other metal prices  operator estimates of proven and probable reserves related to our royalty properties  and operator estimates of operating  capital and reclamation costs are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our investment in these royalty interests in mineral properties 
although we have made our best assessment of these factors based on current market conditions  it is possible that changes could occur  which could adversely affect the net cash flows expected to be generated from these royalty interests 
as part of the company regular asset impairment analysis  the company determined that two insignificant valued exploration stage royalty interests should be written down to zero as of june  
table of contents available for sale securities investments in securities that management does not have the intent to sell in the near term and that have readily determinable fair values are classified as available for sale securities 
unrealized gains and losses on these investments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity  except that declines in market value judged to be other than temporary are recognized in determining net income 
when investments are sold  the realized gains and losses on these investments  determined using the specific identification method  are included in determining net income 
the company policy for determining whether declines in fair value of available for sale securities are other than temporary includes a quarterly analysis of the investments and a review by management of all investments for which the cost exceeds the fair value 
any temporary declines in fair value are recorded as a charge to other comprehensive income 
this evaluation considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and management ability and intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers 
if such impairment is determined by the company to be other than temporary  the investment cost basis is written down to fair value and recorded in net income during the period the company determines such impairment to be other than temporary 
the new cost basis is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
the most significant available for sale security is the investment in seabridge common stock  acquired in june and discussed in greater detail within note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company corrected the original cost basis of the shares  which was overstated by million 
based on the company quarterly impairment analysis  including the severity of the market decline in seabridge common stock during the fiscal year ended june   the company determined that the impairment of its investment in seabridge common stock is other than temporary 
as a result of the impairment  the company recognized a loss on available for sale securities of million during our fiscal year ended june  there were no impairments recognized on our available for sale securities during our fiscal year ended june  the company will continue to evaluate its investment in seabridge common stock considering additional facts and circumstances as they arise  including  but not limited to  the progress of development of seabridge ksm project 
royalty revenue royalty revenue is recognized pursuant to guidance in asc and based upon amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying royalty agreement 
specifically  revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying royalty agreements subject to i the pervasive evidence of the existence of the arrangements  ii the risks and rewards having been transferred  iii the royalty being fixed or determinable  and iv the collectability of the royalty being reasonably assured 
for royalty payments received in kind  royalty revenue is recorded at the average spot price of gold for the period in which the royalty was earned 
revenue recognized pursuant to the robinson royalty agreement is based upon of revenue received by the operator of the mine  kghm  for the sale of minerals from the robinson mine  reduced by certain costs incurred by kghm 
kghm concentrate sales contracts with third party smelters  in general  provide for an initial sales price payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices at the date of shipment 
final true up sales price payments to kghm are subsequently based upon final assay and market metal prices on a specified future date  typically one to three months after the date the concentrate arrives at the third party smelter which generally occurs four to five months after the shipment date from the robinson mine 
we do not have all the key information regarding the terms of the operator smelter contracts  such as the terms of specific 
table of contents concentrate shipments to a smelter or quantities of metal or expected settlement arrangements at the time of an operator shipment of concentrate 
each monthly payment from kghm is typically a combination of revenue received by kghm for provisional payments during the month and any upward or downward adjustments for final assays and commodity prices for earlier shipments 
whether the payment to royal gold is based on kghm revenue in the form of provisional or final payments  royal gold records royalty revenue and the corresponding receivable based on the monthly amounts it receives from kghm  as determined pursuant to the royalty agreement 
the royalty contract does not provide royal gold with rights or obligations to settle any final assay and commodity price adjustments with kghm 
therefore  once a given monthly payment is received by royal gold it is not subject to later adjustment based on adjustments for assays or commodity prices 
under the royalty agreement  kghm may include such final adjustments as a component of future royalty payments 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the guidance of asc the company deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management best assessment of estimated future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year liability by taxing authorities 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management concludes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company operations may involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international tax audits 
the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution could result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period which they are determined 
the company recognizes interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense
