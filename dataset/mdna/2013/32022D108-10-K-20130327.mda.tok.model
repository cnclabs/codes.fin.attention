this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
overview from to  economic conditions deteriorated in the markets we serve  which has had a significant adverse impact on our business 
as a result  our earnings declined due to higher levels of non performing assets and loan losses  impairment charges on goodwill and real estate we acquired through foreclosure  and a charge to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
as economic conditions improved and collateral values stabilized in  our provision for loan losses for the year was much lower than in however  the effects of the economic downturn continue to impact us due to elevated non performing assets and reduced net interest income in a continuing low interest rate environment 
low interest rates  coupled with a competitive lending environment  have proven challenging to our efforts to return to profitability 
we expect that these challenges will continue until interest rates rise 
net loss attributable to common shareholders for the period ended december  was million or per diluted common share compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share for the same period in factors contributing to the net loss for included the following declining net interest income driven by a decline in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and impacted by the continuing low interest rate environment  a million decrease in provision for loans losses  write downs and losses on other real estate owned oreo totaling million  a gain of million on the sale of our four indiana banking centers  a net gain of million on the sale of securities available for sale  as we increased our cash position to prepare for the branch sale and restructured our balance sheet  gains of million on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure  million in penalties for prepaying advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb  which prepayment decreased our cost of funds and improved net interest income  a million fee paid to terminate a property investment and management agreement on a residential development held as oreo  a decrease of  in fdic insurance premiums  and a gain of  on the sale of our last lot held for development 
while still elevated  our level of non performing assets is now the lowest it has been since the second quarter of compared to december   we saw a decline in non performing loans of  a decline in non performing assets of and a decline in classified and criticized assets of 
compared to september   we saw a decline in non performing loans of  a decline in non performing assets of and a decline in classified and criticized assets of 
we sold fifty two oreo properties totaling million during the period 
the net proceeds received from the sale of several of these properties exceeded the carrying value on our books  indicating they were appropriately valued 
our non performing assets are largely comprised of residential housing development assets  building lots  an office building and strip centers  most of which are located in jefferson and oldham counties 
non performing assets were million or of total assets at december  compared to million or of total assets at december  the decrease in non performing assets is mainly attributable to a million decrease in non accrual loans  an million decrease in restructured non accruing mortgage  commercial and commercial real estate loans  and a million decrease in real estate acquired through foreclosure 
we believe that our level of real estate acquired through foreclosure has stabilized 
we anticipate it will decrease over the next several quarters as we continue to sell these properties  while inflow has slowed down substantially compared to and during  we had substantially all of our non performing assets appraised or reappraised  including our high end residential development loans and related oreo  and recorded substantial valuation adjustments and charge offs based on those appraisals 
the lower values on the appraisals and reviews of properties appraised within resulted in million in write downs on oreo  including the million bulk sale adjustment discussed below  compared to million in total write downs recorded during we believe that we have written down oreo values to levels that will facilitate their liquidation  as indicated by recent sales 
we also believe we have appropriately addressed and risk weighted real estate loans in our portfolio 
we have entered into a bulk sale contract to sell fourteen oreo properties with a carrying value of million scheduled to close during the second quarter of the net proceeds after sales expenses will be million  resulting in a million charge against these properties of which million was recorded in the quarter ended june  we incurred higher than usual commission and closing costs due to the size of the transaction 
if sold on a property by property basis  it is unlikely that we would have accepted a discount this large 
however  the proposed bulk sale presented an opportunity to reduce our oreo balance by from million recorded as of december  as with all sales contracts  completing the sale is subject to both parties meeting all of the contractual terms and conditions  and if closing conditions are not satisfied  the proposed sale could be terminated 
the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at december  while net charge offs totaled of average loans for compared to for we attribute the decrease in net charge offs for to our aggressive approach of charging off loans to their liquidation value in and the relative stabilization of collateral values in compared to non performing loans were million or of total loans at december  compared to million  or of total loans for december  the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december  compared to at december  the increase in the coverage ratio for was due to a decrease in non accrual loans and restructured loans on non accrual for the period 
net interest income was million for the period compared to million for the period  while the net interest margin was for compared to in the net interest margin continues to be compressed due to the level of non performing assets  a decline in average loan balances outstanding and assets being placed into lower yielding investments other than loans 
we anticipate modest improvement to the net interest margin over the next several quarters  as we focus on restructuring the balance sheet to decrease our cost of funds and improve interest income 
however  liquidity may be impacted by the acceleration of loan repayments 
to be more proactive  we have hired an investment manager to assist us in our efforts to restructure the balance sheet 
non interest income increased million for  primarily driven by net gains on the sale of investments  a gain on the sale of our four indiana branches  a decline in write downs on oreo properties and an increase in gains on the sale of oreo properties 
non interest expense increased  for compared to the increase in real estate acquired through foreclosure expense was primarily due to a million fee paid to terminate a property investment and management agreement on a residential development held in oreo 
we also prepaid two convertible fixed rate advances during the third quarter of to decrease our cost of funds and improve net interest income  which required payment of million in penalties to the fhlb 
the increase in other expense for the period also relates to increases in legal and consulting fees arising from the branch sale completed during the third quarter of fdic insurance premiums decreased  mainly due to the change in the fdic s assessment base and rate structure that went into effect during the second quarter of in its consent order  the bank agreed to achieve and maintain a tier capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by june  the bank also agreed that if it should be unable to reach the required capital levels by that date  and if directed in writing by the fdic  then the bank would within days develop  adopt and implement a written plan to sell or merge itself into another federally insured financial institution 
to date the bank has not received such a written direction 
the consent order includes the substantive provisions of the consent order and requires the bank to continue to adhere to the plans implemented in response to the consent order 
a copy of the march  consent order is included as exhibit to our annual report on form k filed march  the consent order requires us to obtain the consent of the fdic and the kdfi in order for the bank to pay cash dividends to the corporation 
in addition  the troubled institution designation resulting from the consent order does not allow the bank to accept  renew or rollover brokered deposits  restricts the amount of interest the bank may pay on deposits  and increases its deposit insurance assessment 
at december   the bank s tier capital ratio was and the total risk based capital ratio was 
we notified the bank regulatory agencies that one of the two capital ratios would not be achieved and are continuing our efforts to meet and maintain the required regulatory capital levels and all of the other consent order issues for the bank 
on april   the corporation entered into a formal agreement with the federal reserve bank of st 
louis  which requires the corporation to obtain regulatory approval before declaring any dividends and to take steps to ensure the bank complies with the consent order 
we also may not redeem shares or obtain additional borrowings without prior approval 
bank regulatory agencies can exercise discretion when an institution does not meet the terms of a consent order 
the agencies may initiate changes in management  issue mandatory directives  impose monetary penalties or refrain from formal sanctions  depending on individual circumstances 
any action taken by bank regulatory agencies could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business 
in response to the consent order  we engaged an investment banking firm with expertise in the financial services sector to assist with a review of all of our strategic alternatives as we work to achieve the higher regulatory capital ratios 
one of these alternatives was to sell branches located outside of our core market 
on july   we sold our four banking centers in southern indiana  receiving a premium on the million of consumer and commercial deposits at closing 
the buyer assumed a total of approximately million in non brokered deposits  which included million of government  corporate  other financial institution and municipal deposits for which we received no premium or discount 
we also sold approximately million in performing loans at a discount of 
other assets sold included vault cash of  and fixed assets of  the consummated transaction resulted in a gain of million 
in addition to the sale of our indiana branches  we also sold commercial real estate loans totaling million at par during on may   we entered into an agreement to sell our four banking centers in louisville  kentucky 
the sale was subject to the buyer raising additional capital  regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions 
on november   the buyer terminated the agreement due to its inability to raise sufficient capital to obtain governmental approval of the sale 
we continue to reduce non interest costs where possible to offset the increased credit costs associated with oreo and non performing loans  while maintaining the resources needed to execute our strategies 
we have implemented various cost savings initiatives  including suspending the annual employee stock ownership contribution  freezing most executive management compensation for three years through  freezing most officer compensation for the past year  eliminating cash compensation for the board of directors  reducing marketing and community donation expense  and reducing personnel 
expense reductions totaled million for and million for we are currently evaluating the remaining terms on existing contracts in an effort to identify expenses that can be eliminated in the near future 
our cost savings efforts will remain ongoing 
our plans for include the following continuing to identify and evaluate available strategic options to meet regulatory capital levels and all other requirements of our consent order  such as further divestitures of branch offices 
continuing to serve our community banking customers and operate the corporation and the bank in a safe and sound manner 
we have worked diligently to maintain the strength of our retail and deposit franchise 
the strength of this franchise contributes to earnings as we work through our credit quality issues 
in addition  the inherent value of the retail franchise will provide value to the bank to accomplish the various capital initiatives 
as of june  data  we rank in the top three in four of the five counties that we serve 
this excludes the louisville market and the indiana market where we no longer have a presence 
we rank first in hardin county and meade county with market share of approximately and  respectively 
continuing to reduce our lending concentration in commercial real estate through natural roll off 
we have implemented loan diversification initiatives in place that we believe should improve the loan portfolio 
increased emphasis on retail lending  small business lending and small business administration sba lending are all expected to boost non interest fee income 
we have already reallocated resources that that we believe should contribute to the successful execution of all of these efforts 
our mortgage and consumer lending operations have maintained strong credit quality metrics throughout the economic downturn 
enhancing our resources dedicated to special asset dispositions  both on a permanent and temporary basis  to accelerate our efforts to dispose of problem assets 
our objective is reduce the involvement of our commercial lenders in the special asset area  allowing them to shift their focus to their existing loan customer base and generate new business that supports our diversification efforts while stemming some of the loan roll off 
we hired several new commercial loan officers this year who bring significant experience in real estate and commercial and industrial lending 
while our concerns about economic conditions in our market continue  we are working towards our long range financial objectives  including building additional core customer relationships  maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital levels  improving shareholder value  remediating our problem assets and building upon the sustained success of our retail franchise 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could change as our estimates  assumptions  and judgments change 
certain policies inherently rely more heavily on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance we believe to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan loss review committee  which is comprised of senior officers and certain accounting associates  evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
we estimate the amount of the allowance using past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
while we estimate the allowance for loan losses based in part on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio depend more on credit analysis and recent payment performance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired 
the general component covers non impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience for certain categories adjusted for current factors 
allowance estimates are developed with actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
based on our calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was our estimate of probable incurred losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate required us to record a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million for the period 
if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could materially increase 
impairment of investment securities we review all unrealized losses on our investment securities to determine whether the losses are other than temporary 
we evaluate our investment securities on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant  to determine whether a decline in their value below amortized cost is other than temporary 
we evaluate a number of factors including  but not limited to valuation estimates provided by investment brokers  how much fair value has declined below amortized cost  how long the decline in fair value has existed  the financial condition of the issuer  significant rating agency changes on the issuer  and management s assessment that we do not intend to sell or will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the possibility for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and a charge to earnings is recognized for the credit component and the non credit component is recorded to other comprehensive income 
real estate owned the estimation of fair value is significant to real estate owned acquired through foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure 
fair value is based on the appraised market value of the property based on sales of similar assets when available 
the fair value may be subsequently reduced if the estimated fair value declines below the original appraised value 
appraisals are performed at least annually  if not more frequently 
typically  appraised values are discounted for the projected sale below appraised value in addition to the selling cost 
with certain appraised values where management believes a solid liquidation value has been established  the appraisal has been discounted only by the selling cost 
we have dedicated a team of associates and management to the resolution and work out of oreo due to it having become a larger portion of our assets and a larger area of our risk 
appropriate policies  committees and procedures have been put in place to ensure the proper accounting treatment and risk management of this area 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income loss as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
an assessment is made as to whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
tax credits are recorded as a reduction to the tax provision in the period for which the credits may be utilized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered various factors including our four year cumulative loss position  the level of our non performing assets  our inability to meet our forecasted levels in and and our non compliance with the capital requirements of our consent order 
these factors represent the most significant negative evidence that we considered in concluding that a valuation allowance was necessary at december  and december  results of operations net loss attributable to common shareholders for the period ended december  was million or per diluted common share compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share for the same period in factors contributing to the net loss for included the following declining net interest income driven by a decline in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and impacted by the continuing low interest rate environment  a million decrease in provision for loans losses  write downs and losses on oreo totaling million  a gain of million on the sale of our four indiana banking centers  a net gain of million on the sale of securities available for sale  as we increased our cash position to prepare for the branch sale and restructured our balance sheet  gains of million on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure  million in penalties for prepaying fhlb advances  which prepayment decreased our cost of funds and improved net interest income  a million fee paid to terminate a property investment and management agreement on a residential development held as oreo  a decrease of  in fdic insurance premiums  and a gain of  on the sale of our last lot held for development 
net loss attributable to common shareholders was also increased by dividends accrued on preferred shares 
our book value per common share decreased from at december  to at december  net loss attributable to common shareholders for the period ended december  was million or per diluted common share compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share for the same period in contributing to the increases in the net loss for was a decrease in our net interest margin  an increase of million in provision for loan losses  a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million  write downs taken on real estate acquired through foreclosure  higher fdic insurance premiums  and a higher level of other non interest expense 
net loss attributable to common shareholders was also impacted by dividends accrued on preferred shares 
our book value per common share decreased from at december  to at december  net interest income the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing 
accordingly  changes in interest rates may impact our net interest margin 
the federal open markets committee fomc uses the federal funds rate  which is the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other  to influence interest rates and the national economy 
changes in the federal funds rate have a direct correlation to changes in the prime rate  the underlying index for most of the variable rate loans we issue 
the fomc has held the target federal funds rate at a range of basis points since december as we are asset sensitive  continued low rates will negatively impact our earnings and net interest margin 
the large decline in the volume of interest earning assets and the change in the mix of interest earning assets reduced net interest income for by million compared to the prior year 
average interest earning assets decreased million for compared to driven by a decrease in average loans  partially offset by an increase in average securities 
the decrease in average loans was due to loans included in the branch sale during the third quarter  loan principal payments  payoffs  charge offs and the conversion of nonperforming loans to oreo properties 
in addition  due to the higher regulatory capital ratios required by our consent order  we elected not to replace much of this loan run off in accordance with our efforts to reduce asset size 
the average loan yield was for compared to an average loan yield of for we redeployed available liquidity into more liquid but lower yielding investments 
the yield on earning assets averaged for compared to an average yield on earning assets of for this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in our cost of funds  which averaged for compared to an average cost of funds of for net interest margin as a percent of average earning assets decreased basis points to for compared to for to decrease our cost of funds and improve net interest income  during the third quarter we prepaid a million convertible fixed rate advance having an interest rate of and a scheduled maturity date of in addition  we also prepaid a million convertible fixed rate advance having an interest rate of and a scheduled date of we anticipate being able to take advantage of the continued low interest rate environment to reduce our cost of funds  as term deposits re price at more favorable terms

gain on sale of mortgage loans increased for due to an increase in the volume of loans refinanced  originated and sold compared to prevailing mortgage interest rates remained at attractive levels during the period helping to contribute to the increase in volume 
we invest in various types of liquid assets  including united states treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  mutual funds  stocks and others 
during we recorded a gain on the sale of debt investment securities of million 
offsetting this gain was a loss on the sales of debt investment securities of million 
the recorded loss on sale was primarily related to the sale of our trust preferred securities 
gains and losses on investment securities are infrequent and are not a consistent recurring core source of income 
the sale of debt investment securities during is mainly related to the restructuring of the balance sheet and the branch sale that closed on july  as the sale of the branches was settled in cash 
we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of  for the expected credit loss during the period on one of our trust preferred securities  compared to  of impairment charges for the impairment charge was related to preferred term security vi 
management believes this impairment was primarily attributable to the current economic environment in which the financial condition of some of the issuers deteriorated 
preferred term security vi was called for early redemption in july we received principal and interest of  and recorded a gain on sale of  we sold preferred term security xxii in the third quarter of receiving principal of  and recording a loss on sale of  in the fourth quarter we sold the remaining three trust preferred securities receiving total principal of  and recording a loss on sale of  reducing non interest income for was million in losses on the sale and write down of real estate owned properties due to the decline in market value of properties held in this portfolio 
offsetting the losses and write downs were recorded gains of million on the sale of twenty five real estate owned properties 
during the third quarter of  we successfully sold four banking centers located in corydon  elizabeth  lanesville and georgetown  indiana 
the transaction resulted in a gain of million 
during the second quarter of we recorded  in gains from the sale of the last of nine lots we held for sale in an office park adjacent to our home office 
we also recorded a gain of  on the sale of two properties held as possible banking center locations

we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of  for the expected credit loss during the period on three of our trust preferred securities  compared to million of impairment charges for management believes this impairment was primarily attributable to the current economic environment which caused the financial conditions of some of the issuers to deteriorate 
further reducing non interest income for was an increase of million in losses on the sale and write down of real estate owned properties due to the decline in market value of properties held in this portfolio

the decrease for was due to higher insurance claims recorded in under our self funded insurance plan and a decrease in the number of employees 
full time equivalent employees decreased from at december  to at december  office occupancy and equipment expense  marketing and advertising related expenses and outside services and data processing related expenses decreased in part due to the sale of our four indiana banking centers and cost cutting initiatives 
fdic insurance premiums decreased for the period mainly due to the change in the fdic s assessment base and rate structure that went into effect during the second quarter of the increase in real estate acquired through foreclosure expense was primarily due to a million fee paid to terminate a property investment and management agreement on a residential development held in oreo 
loan expense decreased for due to the cost of obtaining new appraisals on real estate securing some of our commercial real estate loans and higher loan portfolio management expenses in during  we had substantially all of our non performing assets appraised or reappraised 
during the third quarter of  we prepaid fhlb advances to decrease our cost of funds and improve net interest income 
we prepaid a million convertible fixed rate advance with an interest rate of and a scheduled maturity date of we also prepaid a million convertible fixed rate advance with an interest rate of and a scheduled date of in connection with these transactions  we incurred million in prepayment penalties 
the increase in other expense for the period relates to increases in legal and consulting fees arising from the branch sale completed during the third quarter of non interest expense increased million to million for the period compared to outside services expense increased due to expenses incurred in connection with loan workout activities and the addition of loan workout specialists to our staff 
fdic insurance premiums increased  due to the higher fdic insurance rate resulting from the bank s regulatory rating 
expense related to real estate acquired through foreclosure increased  due to the higher level of properties in this portfolio at december  loan expense increased due to increases in loan portfolio management expenses such as the cost of obtaining new appraisals on real estate securing some of our commercial real estate loans 
the increase in loan expense reflects our elevated level of non performing loans 
other expense increased due to increases in interchange expense  examination and legal fees and losses on low income housing investments 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes federal and state income taxes and in  and reflects a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets that are not currently recoverable through carryback 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a benefit of 
the effective tax rate for the years ended december  and is not meaningful due to the reduction of income tax benefit as the result of the establishment of a deferred tax valuation allowance 
our tax benefit is entirely due to gains in other comprehensive income that are presented in current operations in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
historically  the fluctuations in effective tax rates reflect the effect of the differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income and expenses  respectively  for income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required when it is considered more likely than not that all or part of the benefit related to such assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered various factors including our four year cumulative loss position  the level of our non performing assets  our inability to meet our forecasted levels in and and our non compliance with the capital requirements of our consent order 
these factors represent the most significant negative evidence that we considered in concluding that a valuation allowance was necessary at december  and december  our future effective income tax rate will fluctuate based on the mix of taxable and tax free investments we make and  to a greater extent  the impact of changes in the required amount of valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets and our overall level of taxable income 
recording a valuation allowance does not have any impact on our liquidity  nor does it preclude us from using the tax losses  tax credits or other timing differences in the future 
to the extent that we generate taxable income in a given quarter  the valuation allowance may be reduced to fully or partially offset the corresponding income tax expense 
any remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reversed through income tax expense once we can demonstrate a sustainable return to profitability and conclude that it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be utilized prior to expiration

analysis of financial condition total assets at december  decreased million compared to total assets at december  the decrease was primarily due to a decline of million in total loans 
total deposits decreased million and we paid off million in advances from the fhlb 
contributing to the decline in loans and deposits was the sale of our four southern indiana banking centers 
we received a premium on the million of consumer and commercial deposits at closing 
the buyer assumed approximately million in non brokered deposits  which included million of government  corporate  other financial institution and municipal deposits for which we received no premium or discount 
we also sold approximately million in performing loans at a discount of 
loans total loans decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  our commercial real estate and commercial portfolios decreased million to million at december  our residential mortgage loan  real estate construction  consumer and home equity and indirect consumer portfolios all also decreased for the period 
the decline in our commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios is a result of pay offs  charge offs on large commercial real estate loans  and commercial loans being transferred to real estate acquired through foreclosure 
charge offs made up million or of this decrease 
the decline in the loan portfolio was also due  in part  to our ongoing efforts to resolve problem loans and the indiana branch divestiture 
we sold million in residential mortgage loans  million in consumer and home equity loans and  in commercial and commercial real estate loans in the divestiture 
in addition  due to the higher regulatory capital ratios required by our consent order  we have elected not to replace much of this loan run off in accordance with our efforts to reduce asset size

an increase in loan charge offs or non performing loans or an inadequate allowance for loan losses could reduce net interest income  net income and capital  and limit the range of products and services we can offer 
the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses monthly to maintain a level it believes to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the committee determines the allowance by applying loss estimates to graded loans by categories  as described below 
when appropriate  a specific reserve will be established for individual impaired loans based upon the risk classification and the estimated potential for loss 
in accordance with our credit management processes  we obtain new appraisals on properties securing our non performing commercial and commercial real estate loans and use those appraisals to determine specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses 
as we receive new appraisals on properties securing non performing loans  we recognize charge offs and adjust specific reserves as appropriate 
in addition  the committee analyzes such factors as changes in lending policies and procedures  real estate market conditions  underwriting standards  collection  charge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characteristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinations 
declines in collateral values  including commercial real estate  may impact our ability to collect on certain loans when borrowers are dependent on the values of the real estate as a source of cash flow 
from continuing into  we substantially increased our provision for loan losses for our general and specific reserves as we identified adverse conditions 
while we anticipate that challenges will continue in the foreseeable future as we manage the overall level of our credit quality  we believe that credit quality appears to be stabilizing 
during we experienced a lower level of provision for loan losses due to the relative stabilization of collateral values compared to as discussed in the overview to this section  we have entered into a consent order with bank regulatory agencies 
in addition to increasing capital ratios  we agreed to maintain adequate reserves for loan losses  develop and implement plans to reduce the level of non performing assets and concentrations of credit in commercial real estate loans  implement revised credit risk management practices and credit administration policies and procedures  and report our progress to the regulators

our provision for loan loss was higher in due to our efforts to ensure the adequacy of the allowance by adding specific reserves to several large commercial real estate relationships based on updated appraisals of the underlying collateral 
we require appraisals and perform evaluations on impaired assets upon initial identification 
thereafter  we obtain appraisals or perform market value evaluations on impaired assets at least annually 
recognizing the volatility of certain assets  we assess the transaction and market conditions to determine if updated appraisals are needed more frequently than annually 
additionally  we evaluate the collateral condition and value upon foreclosure 
the higher provision for was also due to our increasing the general reserve provisioning levels for commercial real estate loans due to the general credit quality trend and the higher level of charge offs 
the allowance for loan losses remained relatively constant for the period compared to net charge offs of million included specific reserves of million on our collateral dependent loans of which million was previously reserved for at december  appraisal values declined significantly on one to four family residential developments during we believe these values are at or near liquidation value at december  we also believe this concentration has been fully identified and properly risk rated 
the pass loans in this concentration have been separately evaluated for general allowance allocations 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans  including loans held for sale and the related discounts allocated to those loans in a probable branch divestiture  was for december  compared to at december  continuing our efforts to ensure the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we added specific reserves to two large commercial real estate relationships based on updated appraisals of the underlying collateral 
specific reserves as allocated to impaired loans made up of the total allowance for loan loss at december  compared to at december  net charge offs for the period included million in partial charge offs compared to partial charge offs of million for the same period in allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans increased to at december  from at december  the increase in the coverage ratio for was primarily due to a decrease in non accrual loans and restructured loans on non accrual for the period 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   a decrease of million from december  the decrease was driven by net charge offs of million taken during the period  including specific reserves of million charged off on our collateral dependent loans of which only million had been reserved for at december  we also took write downs to reflect updated appraisal information obtained as part of our on going monitoring of the loan portfolio 
appraisal values on one to four family residential developments declined significantly more during than during the decline in the specific reserves resulting from charge offs caused the allowance as a percent of total loans and the allowance as a percent of non performing loans to both decline 
the allowance as a percent of total loans was for december  compared to at december  specific reserves allocated to impaired loans made up of the total allowance for loan loss at december  net charge offs for the period included million in partial charge offs compared to partial charge offs of for the period 
allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans declined to at december  from at december  the decline in the coverage ratio was due to the charge off of specific reserves during as well as the increase in restructured loans 
provision for loan loss increased million to million for compared to the increase was primarily related to residential housing development and building lot loans in jefferson and oldham counties and our continued efforts to ensure the adequacy of the allowance by adding specific reserves to several large commercial real estate relationships based on updated appraisals of the underlying collateral 
the higher provision was also due to our increasing the general reserve provisioning levels for commercial real estate loans due to the general credit quality trend and the higher level of charge offs 
the following table depicts management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
allowance and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors

the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
in addition  we also classify loans as criticized 
loans classified as criticized have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention 
the following table provides information with respect to criticized and classified loans for the periods indicated december  december  december  december  dollars in thousands criticized loans total criticized     classified loans substandard     doubtful loss  total classified     total criticized and classified    total criticized and classified loans declined by million or from december  and by million or from december  we have experienced sequential quarterly declines in each quarter since june  approximately million or of the total classified loans at december  were related to commercial real estate loans in our market area 
several of the non performing loans that were added during were adequately collateralized and therefore did not require additional reserves 
classified consumer loans totaled  classified mortgage loans totaled million and classified commercial loans totaled million 
the change in our level of allowance for loan losses is a result of a consistent allowance methodology that is driven by risk ratings 
for more information on collection efforts  evaluation of collateral and how loss amounts are estimated  see non performing assets  below 
although we may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for active charge offs 
we develop our allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates represent a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio  which we apply to loans based on loan type 
if economic conditions continue to put stress on our borrowers going forward  this may require higher provisions for loan losses in future periods 
credit quality will continue to be a primary focus during and going forward 
we have allocated additional resources to address credit quality and facilitate the structure and processes to diversify and strengthen our lending function 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain non accruing restructured loans for which the interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
we do not have any loans longer than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired when we no longer anticipate full principal or interest will be paid in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
if a loan is impaired  we allocate a portion of the allowance so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from collateral 
non accrual loans that have been restructured remain on non accrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which will require that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance in accordance to the restructured terms of six months or more 
accruing loans that have been restructured are evaluated for non accrual status based on a current evaluation of the borrower s financial condition and ability and willingness to service the modified debt 
we review our loans on a regular basis and implement normal collection procedures when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
we generally charge off consumer loans when management deems a loan uncollectible and any available collateral has been liquidated 
we handle commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies on an individual basis 
these loans are placed on non accrual status upon becoming contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest or where substantial doubt about full repayment of principal and interest is evident 
we recognize interest income on loans on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non accrual of income status 
we discontinue accruing interest on impaired loans when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when we discontinue interest accrual  we reverse existing accrued interest and subsequently recognize interest income only to the extent we receive cash payments and are assured of repayment of all outstanding principal 
we classify real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
we classify new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired we record it at fair value less estimated selling costs 
we charge any write down of the property at the time of acquisition to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense 
real estate owned acquired through foreclosure is recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure 
fair value is based on the appraised market value of the property based on sales of similar assets 
the fair value may be subsequently reduced if the estimated fair value declines below the original appraised value 
we monitor market information and the age of appraisals on existing real estate owned properties and obtain new appraisals as circumstances warrant 
real estate acquired through foreclosure was million  a decrease of million from to real estate acquired through foreclosure includes million in land development properties and building lots  which are located primarily in our jefferson county market 
we believe that our level of real estate acquired through foreclosure has stabilized 
we anticipate reductions over the next several quarters as we continue to sell oreo properties  while inflow has slowed down substantially compared to and all properties held in oreo are listed for sale with various independent real estate agents 
we have entered into a bulk sale contract to sell fourteen oreo properties with a carrying value of million scheduled to close during the second quarter of approximately million of oreo write downs and the previously mentioned million termination fee were recorded during the year ended december  when the terms of this agreement were being negotiated 
as with all sales contracts  completing the sale is subject to both parties meeting all of the contractual terms and conditions  and if closing conditions are not satisfied  the proposed sale could be terminated 
a summary of the real estate acquired through foreclosure activity is as follows december  dollars in thousands beginning balance    additions    sales    writedowns    valuation allowance ending balance    the following table provides information with respect to non performing assets for the periods indicated

restructured loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status until we determine that the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance of at least six months in accordance to the restructured terms 
the change in non accrual loans was due to a decrease in non accrual loans due to write downs of million based upon updated appraisals  the transfer of a non accrual relationship totaling million to restructured status and the transfer of ten non accrual relationships totaling million to real estate acquired through foreclosure 
this decrease was offset by the addition of two non accrual relationships totaling million 
a concentration in loans for residential subdivision development in jefferson and oldham counties contributed significantly to the increases in our non performing loans and our non performing assets during the past three years 
at december   substantially all of our residential housing development assets in these counties have been classified as impaired and written down to what we believe to be at or near liquidation value 
the remaining residential development credits are smaller and have strong guarantors 
all non performing loans are considered impaired 
the following table provides information with respect to restructured loans for the periods indicated 
december  dollar in thousands restructured loans on non accrual   restructured loans on accrual    total restructured loans    the decrease in restructured loans on non accrual for resulted from the transfer of one non accrual relationship totaling million to real estate acquired through foreclosure and the transfer of six non accrual relationships totaling million to accrual status 
offsetting this decrease was the transfer of a commercial real estate loan relationship totaling million from restructured on accrual to non accrual 
eleven commercial real estate relationships totaling million were added to restructured loans on accrual 
the loans were evaluated as impaired loans and appropriately allocated specific reserve allowances 
the terms of our restructured loans have been renegotiated to reduce the rate of interest or extend the term  thus reducing the amount of cash flow required from the borrower to service the loans 
we anticipate that our level of restructured loans will remain elevated as we identify borrowers in financial difficulty and work with them to modify to more affordable terms 
we have worked with customers when feasible to establish a and b note structures 
the b note is charged off on our books but remains an outstanding balance for the customer 
these typically carry a very nominal or low rate of interest 
the a note is a note structured on a proper basis meeting internal policy standards for a performing loan 
after six months of performance  the a note restructured loan is eligible to be placed back on an accrual basis as a performing troubled debt restructured loan 
investment securities interest on securities provides us our largest source of interest income after interest on loans  constituting of the total interest income for the year ended december  the securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings  and contributes to the management of interest rate risk 
we have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including short term united states treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit at insured savings and loans and banks  bankers acceptances  and federal funds 
we may also invest a portion of our assets in certain commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
we are also authorized to invest in mutual funds and stocks whose assets conform to the investments that we are authorized to make directly 
the investment portfolio increased by million due to the purchase of government sponsored mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds offset by the sales of lower yielding investments 
recent purchases have been high cash flow instruments with short average lives in order to decrease the volatility of the investment portfolio as well as provide cash flow and limit interest rate risk 
the unrealized losses on our us treasury and agency securities  government sponsored mortgage backed residential securities  government sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations and our corporate bonds were a result of changes in interest rates for fixed rate securities where the interest rate received is less than the current rate available for new offerings of similar securities 
because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these investments until recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of  for the expected credit loss during the period and million during the time we held five trust preferred securities with an original cost basis of million 
the impairment charge was related to preferred term security vi 
preferred term security vi was called for early redemption in july we received principal and interest of  and recorded a gain on sale of  we sold preferred term security xxii in the third quarter of receiving principal of  and recording a loss on sale of  in the fourth quarter we sold the remaining three trust preferred securities receiving total principal of  and recording a loss on sale of  the following table provides the carrying value of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated

deposits we rely primarily on providing excellent customer service and on our long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years market conditions have caused us to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of the use of those products on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
historically  we have utilized certificates of deposit placed by deposit brokers and deposits obtained through the cdars program to support our asset growth 
the cdars system enables certificates of deposit that would exceed the current  fdic coverage limit on deposits in a single financial institution to be redistributed to other financial institutions within the cdars network in increments under the current coverage limit 
however  as a result of our consent order  we can no longer accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits including deposits obtained through the cdars program without prior regulatory approval 
total deposits decreased million since december  during the third quarter of  we sold our four indiana offices in which the buyer assumed million of deposits in the transaction 
public funds increased million while retail and commercial deposits decreased million 
we have public funds deposits from school boards  water districts and municipalities within our markets 
these deposits are larger than individual retail depositors 
however  we do not have a deposit relationship that is significant enough to cause a negative impact on our liquidity position 
brokered deposits and cdars certificates decreased million 
brokered deposits were million at december  compared to million at december  in we became a member of qwickrate  a premier non brokered market place that we use as an additional low cost funding source 
qwickrate deposits totaled million at december  we do not anticipate a negative impact as a result of not being able to renew the million of brokered deposits due to additional funding sources such as qwickrate  decreased loan generation  continued loan pay downs  and our highly liquid and mostly short term investment portfolio 
we offer a broad selection of deposit instruments  including non interest bearing checking  statement and passbook savings accounts  health savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
we also offer tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
management periodically adjusts interest rates paid on our deposit products  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties 
the variety of deposit accounts allows us to compete more effectively for funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities 
however  market conditions and regulatory restrictions continue to significantly affect our ability to attract and maintain deposits and our cost of funds 
we have deployed additional resources to try to reduce our cost of funds in this low rate environment 
the consent order resulted in the bank being categorized as a troubled institution by bank regulators and as a result limits the interest rate the bank can pay on interest bearing deposits 
unless the bank is granted a waiver because it resides in a market that the fdic determines is a high rate market  the bank is limited to paying deposit interest rates 
above the average rates computed by the fdic 
the bank has applied and has been granted the waiver for however  the bank recently elected to adhere to average rates computed by the fdic plus the 
rate cap

the following table shows at december  the amount of our certificates of deposit of  or more by time remaining until maturity 
certificates maturity period of deposit in thousands three months or less  three through six months  six through twelve months  over twelve months  total  advances from federal home loan bank deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for our general business purposes 
we can also use advances borrowings from the federal home loan bank to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
at december   outstanding fhlb advances totaled million 
to decrease our cost of funds and improve interest income  we prepaid two fhlb advances during the third quarter of we prepaid a million convertible fixed rate advance with an interest rate of and a scheduled maturity date of we also prepaid a million convertible fixed rate advance with an interest rate of and a scheduled date of in connection with these transactions  we incurred million in prepayment penalties 
at december   we had sufficient collateral available to borrow approximately million in additional advances from the fhlb 
advances from the fhlb are secured by our stock in the fhlb  certain securities  and substantially all of our first mortgage loans on an individual basis 
the fhlb of cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings banks and other member financial institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our home mortgages  other real estate loans and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided that we meet certain creditworthiness standards

the subsidiaries have loaned the sales proceeds from these issuances to us in exchange for junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
we are not considered the primary beneficiary of these trusts  which are variable interest entities 
therefore the trusts are not consolidated in our financial statements 
rather  the subordinated debentures we have issued to them are shown as a liability 
our investment in the common stock of the trusts was  the subordinated debentures are considered as tier capital or tier capital for the corporation under current regulatory guidelines 
under such guidelines  capital received from the proceeds of the sale of trust preferred securities cannot constitute more than of the total core capital of the corporation 
consequently  the amount of subordinated debentures in excess of the limitation constitutes tier capital for the corporation 
we have the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed five consecutive years 
in  one such trust subsidiary issued million in trust preferred securities and loaned the sales proceeds to us  which we used to finance the purchase of our indiana banking operations 
the subordinated debentures we issued to the trust mature on june   can be called at par in whole or in part on or after june   and pay a fixed rate of for thirty years 
in  the other trust subsidiary issued year cumulative trust preferred securities totaling million at a year fixed rate of adjusting quarterly thereafter at libor plus basis points 
these securities mature on march   and can be called at par in whole or in part on or after march  on october   we exercised our right to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on both issues of junior subordinated notes relating to outstanding trust preferred securities 
we have the right to defer payments of interest for up to consecutive quarterly periods without default or penalty 
after such period  we must pay all deferred interest and resume quarterly interest payments or we will be in default 
during the deferral period  the subsidiary trusts will likewise suspend payment of dividends on their trust preferred securities 
the regular scheduled interest payments will continue to be accrued for payment in the future and reported as an expense for financial statement purposes 
as of december   these accrued but unpaid interest payments totaled million 
liquidity liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  at a reasonable cost  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
our investment and funds management policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
the bank management continually monitors the bank s liquidity position with oversight from the asset liability committee 
our banking centers provide access to retail deposit markets 
if large certificate depositors shift to our competitors or other markets in response to interest rate changes  we have the ability to replenish those deposits through alternative funding sources 
in addition to maintaining a stable core deposit base  we maintain adequate liquidity primarily through the use of investment securities 
traditionally  we have also borrowed from the fhlb to supplement our funding requirements 
at december   we had sufficient collateral available to borrow approximately million in additional advances from the fhlb 
we believe that we have adequate funding sources through unpledged investment securities  repayments of loan principal  investment securities paydowns and potential asset maturities and sales to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase common stock  make selected investments and acquisitions  and service debt 
the main sources of funding for the corporation include dividends from the bank  borrowings and access to the capital markets 
the primary source of funding for the corporation has been dividends and returns of investment from the bank 
kentucky banking laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the corporation by the bank without prior approval of the kdfi 
under these laws  the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to current year s net income  as defined in the laws  combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years  less any dividends declared during those periods 
our consent order requires us to obtain the consent of the regional director of the fdic and the commissioner of the kdfi to declare and pay cash dividends to the corporation 
the corporation has also entered into a formal agreement with the federal reserve to obtain regulatory approval before declaring any dividends 
we may not redeem shares or obtain additional borrowings without prior approval 
because of these limitations  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the corporation 
during  the bank did not declare or pay any dividends to the corporation 
cash held by the corporation at december  was  compared to cash of  at december  capital stockholders equity decreased million during  primarily due to a net loss attributable to common shareholders recorded during the period 
our average stockholders equity to average assets ratio decreased to at december  compared to at the end of on january   we sold million of cumulative perpetual preferred shares  with a liquidation preference of  per share the senior preferred shares to the us treasury treasury under the terms of its capital purchase program 
the senior preferred shares constitute tier capital and rank senior to our common shares 
the senior preferred shares pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and will reset to a rate of per year on january  under the terms of our cpp stock purchase agreement  we also issued treasury a warrant to purchase an amount of our common stock equal to of the aggregate amount of the senior preferred shares  or million 
the warrant entitles treasury to purchase  common shares at a purchase price of per share 
the initial exercise price for the warrant and the number of shares subject to the warrant were determined by reference to the market price of our common stock calculated on a day trailing average as of december   the date treasury approved our application 
the warrant has a term of years and is potentially dilutive to earnings per share 
effective with the fourth quarter of  we suspended payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on our senior preferred shares 
the dividends are cumulative and failure to pay dividends for six quarters would trigger the rights of the holder of our senior preferred shares to appoint representatives to our board of directors 
the dividends will continue to be accrued for payment in the future and reported as a preferred dividend requirement that is deducted from income to common shareholders for financial statement purposes 
in recent months  treasury has been holding auctions to sell securities issued in its capital purchase program 
we have been notified of treasury intent to sell at auction our senior preferred shares  but a date for such action has not been set at this time 
once treasury completes a sale of our senior preferred shares  the full million stated value of our senior preferred shares would still remain outstanding and our obligation to pay dividends  currently at an annual rate of and increasing to in january  would continue until the securities are retired 
during  we did not purchase any shares of our common stock 
like our agreement with the federal reserve  the terms of our senior preferred shares do not allow us to repurchase shares of our common stock without prior written consent until the senior preferred shares are redeemed 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banks 
banks must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets ranging from to  subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of an organization s overall safety and soundness 
in its consent order  the bank agreed to achieve and maintain a tier capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by june  at december   the bank s tier capital ratio was and the total risk based capital ratio was 
we notified the bank regulatory agencies that one of the two capital ratios would not be achieved and are continuing our efforts to meet and maintain the required regulatory capital levels and all of the other consent order issues for the bank 
the terms of the consent order and the actions we have taken to attain the capital ratios and meet the other requirements of the order are described in greater detail in the overview to this section 
the following table shows the ratios of tier capital  total capital to risk adjusted assets and the leverage ratios for the corporation and the bank as of december  capital adequacy ratios as of december  regulatory ratio required risk based capital ratios minimums by consent order the bank the corporation tier capital n a total risk based capital tier leverage ratio off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist of commitments to make loans  unused borrower lines of credit  and standby letters of credit  which are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
aggregate contractual obligations greater than greater than less than one year to years to more than december  total one year years years years dollars in thousands aggregate contractual obligations time deposits     fhlb borrowings   subordinated debentures   lease commitments    fhlb borrowings represent the amounts that are due to the fhlb of cincinnati 
these amounts have fixed maturity dates 
one of these borrowings  although fixed  is subject to conversion provisions at the option of the fhlb 
the fhlb has the right to convert this advance to a variable rate or we can prepay the advance at no penalty 
there is a substantial penalty if we prepay the advance before the fhlb exercises its right 
we do not believe the convertible fixed rate advance will be converted in the near term 
the subordinated debentures  which mature june  and march   are redeemable before the maturity date at our option on or after june  and march  at their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the subordinated debentures are also redeemable in whole or in part from time to time  upon the occurrence of specific events defined within the trust indenture 
the interest rate on the subordinated debentures is at a year fixed rate of and a year fixed rate of adjusting quarterly thereafter at libor plus on october   we exercised our right to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on both issues of junior subordinated notes relating to outstanding trust preferred securities 
together  the junior subordinated notes had an outstanding principal amount of million 
we have the right to defer payments of interest for up to consecutive quarterly periods without default or penalty 
after such period  we must pay all deferred interest and resume quarterly interest payments or we will be in default 
during the deferral period  our subsidiary trusts will likewise suspend payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities they issued 
the regular scheduled interest payments will continue to be accrued for payment in the future and reported as an expense for financial statement purposes 
lease commitments represent the total future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
impact of inflation changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this filing have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation and changes in prices 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
comprised of senior management representatives  the alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
we then evaluate potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
we also incorporate assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at december  and december  given a sustained basis point decrease in interest rates  our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a sustained basis point increase in interest rates  our base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared to an increase of 
at december  our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  their relative pricing schedules  market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
we use various asset liability strategies to manage the re pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within our guidelines of acceptable levels of risk taking 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables  our balance sheet has an asset sensitive position 
this means that our earning assets  which consist of loans and investment securities  will change in price at a faster rate than our deposits and borrowings 
therefore  if short term interest rates increase  our net interest income will increase 
likewise  if short term interest rates decrease  our net interest income will decrease 
our sensitivity to interest rate changes is presented based on data as of december  and december  decrease in rates increase in rates dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points projected interest income loans      investments      total interest income     projected interest expense deposits      borrowed funds     total interest expense     net interest income     change from base    change from base december  decrease in rates increase in rates dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points projected interest income loans      investments      total interest income     projected interest expense deposits      borrowed funds     total interest expense    net interest income     change from base   change from base during the second quarter of we revised some of our interest rate risk assumptions and measures resulting in increased exposure to net interest income in a decreased and increased rate environment  mainly due to a decrease in total interest income when compared to december
