item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions throughout management s discussion and analysis the following discussion compares our results for the year ended september   to the year ended september   and also compares our results for the year ended september  to the year ended september  we begin the discussion at a consolidated level and then provide separate detail about the process equipment group  batesville  and corporate 
these financial results are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
we also provide certain non gaap operating performance measures 
these non gaap measures are referred to as adjusted and exclude expenses associated with backlog amortization  inventory step up  business acquisitions  restructuring  antitrust litigation  and sales tax recoveries 
the measures also exclude the tax benefit of the international integration in and expenses associated with long term incentive compensation related to the international integration 
the related income tax effect for all of these items is also excluded 
this non gaap information is provided as a supplement  not as a substitute for  or as superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
an important non gaap measure that we use is adjusted earnings before interest  income tax  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda 
as previously discussed  a part of our strategy is to selectively acquire companies that we believe can benefit from our core competencies to spur faster and more profitable growth 
given that strategy  it is a natural consequence to incur related 
table of contents expenses  such as amortization from acquired intangible assets and additional interest expense from debt funded acquisitions 
accordingly  we use adjusted ebitda  among other measures  to monitor our business performance 
we analyze net revenue on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods 
we provide this information because exchange rates can distort the underlying change in sales  either positively or negatively 
we use this non gaap information internally to make operating decisions and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period to period comparisons of our ongoing operating results 
the information can also be used to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items 
we believe this information provides a higher degree of transparency 
see page for a reconciliation of non gaap measures to the closest gaap equivalent of each measure 
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
a detailed description of our accounting policies is included in the notes to our financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
revenue recognition net revenue includes gross revenue less sales discounts  customer rebates  sales incentives  and product returns  all of which require us to make estimates for the portion of these allowances that have yet to be credited or paid to our customers 
we estimate these allowances based upon historical rates and projections of customer purchases toward contractual rebate thresholds 
following the acquisition of coperion  a portion of hillenbrand s revenue is derived from long term manufacturing contracts 
the majority of this revenue is recognized based on the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenue is recognized based upon the costs incurred to date as compared to the total estimated project costs 
approximately of hillenbrand s revenue was attributable to these long term manufacturing contracts for accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost 
contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities  modified by our assumptions regarding contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance clauses 
contract costs are incurred over longer periods of time and  accordingly  the estimation of these costs requires management judgment 
cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  and other economic projections 
significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends  technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  and anticipated labor agreements 
revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances 
anticipated losses on long term contracts are recognized immediately when such losses become evident 
we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification  contract pricing  and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses 
revenue for components  replacement parts  and service is recognized on a completed contract basis when title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
performance based stock compensation the vesting of our performance based stock awards is contingent upon the creation of shareholder value as measured by the cumulative cash returns and final period net operating profit after tax compared to the established hurdle rate over a three year period 
the hurdle rate is a reflection of the weighted average cost of capital and targeted capital structure 
based on the extent to which the performance criteria are achieved  it is possible for none of the awards to vest or for a range up to the maximum to vest  which is reflected in the performance based stock award table in note to our financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
we record expense associated with the awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period based upon an estimate of projected performance 
the actual performance of the company is evaluated quarterly  and the expense is adjusted according to the new projection if it has changed significantly 
as a result  depending on the degree to which performance criteria are achieved or our projections change  our expenses related to the performance based stock awards may become more volatile as we approach the final performance measurement date at the end of the three years 
this increase in volatility stems from the requirement to increase or reduce compensation expense as the projection of performance changes 
thus  any one period s financial results could be significantly affected by the cumulative effect of the adjustment 
preparing the projection of performance requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the expected outcome of final performance up to three years in the future 
in making the projection  we consider both actual results and probable business plans for the future 
at september   
table of contents we have recorded cumulative compensation expense associated with unvested performance based stock awards of which continues to be subject to periodic adjustments as the related awards approach their final performance measurement dates 
retirement and postretirement plans we sponsor retirement and postretirement benefit plans covering the majority of our employees 
expense recognized for the plans is based upon actuarial valuations 
inherent in those valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected returns on assets  and projected future salary rates 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span  and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our financial statements in the future 
the discount rates used in the valuation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are evaluated annually based on current market conditions 
in setting the discount rate  we use a yield curve approach to discount each expected cash flow of the liability stream at an interest rate applicable to the timing of each cash flow based on corporate bond rates 
these present values are then converted into an equivalent weighted average discount rate 
our overall expected long term rate of return on pension assets is based on historical and expected future returns  which are inflation adjusted and weighted for the expected return for each component of the investment portfolio 
our rate of assumed compensation increase for pension benefits is also based on our specific historical trends of past wage adjustments in recent years and expectations for the future 
changes in retirement and postretirement benefit expense and the recognized obligations may occur in the future as a result of a number of factors  including changes to key assumptions such as the weighted average expected rate of return on pension assets and the weighted average discount rate 
our weighted average expected rate of return on pension assets was   and at the end of   and  and the weighted average discount rate at the end of was for the pension plan and for the postretirement healthcare plan 
a basis point change in the expected rate of return on domestic pension assets changes annual pension expense by a basis point change in the discount rate changes the annual domestic pension expense by and the annual postretirement healthcare plan expense by less than impacts from assumption changes could be positive or negative depending on the direction of the change in rates 
based upon the new rates and assumptions  we expect the aggregate expense associated with our defined benefit plans to decrease to in see note to our financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k  for key assumptions and other information regarding our retirement and postretirement benefit plans 
uncertain income tax positions in assessing the need for reserves for uncertain tax positions  we make judgments regarding the technical merit of a tax position and  when necessary  an estimate of the settlement amount based upon the probability of the outcome 
at september   we had reserves of established for uncertain tax positions based upon our estimates 
our ability to make and update these estimates is limited to the information we have at any given point in time 
this information can include how taxing authorities have treated the position in the past  how similar cases have settled  or where we are in discussions or negotiations with taxing authorities on a particular issue  among others 
as information available to us evolves  we update our reserves quarterly 
these updates can result in volatility to our income tax rate particularly in a given quarter if new information or developments result in a significant change in our estimate 
business combinations estimating fair value for acquired assets and liabilities as part of a business combination typically requires us to exercise judgment  particularly for those assets and liabilities that may be unique or not easily determined by reference to market data 
often estimates for these types of acquired assets and liabilities will be developed using valuation models that require both historical and forecasted inputs  as well as market participant expectations 
thus  the valuation is directly affected by the inputs we judge as best under the given circumstances 
when material  we expect to seek assistance of competent valuation professionals when the underlying valuation is more complex or unique 
we anticipate that in most cases  we will exercise significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets  contingent liabilities  and contingent consideration 
this list is not exhaustive  but is designed to give you a better understanding of where we think a larger degree of judgment will be required due to the nature of the item and the way it is typically valued 
asset impairment determinations we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or whenever circumstances suggest that impairment may have occurred 
we evaluate the carrying value of finite lived intangible assets whenever circumstances suggest that impairment may have occurred 
significant assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results  strategic plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital  comparable transactions  market data  and earnings multiples 
the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the anticipated future cash flows  discount rates  and the earnings multiples 
while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions  actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future non cash impairment charges 

table of contents executive overview hillenbrand is a global diversified industrial company that makes and sells premium business to business products and services for a wide variety of industries 
we pursue profitable growth and meaningful dividends for our shareholders by leveraging our leading brands  robust cash generation capabilities  and strong core competencies 
hillenbrand has two segments the process equipment group and batesville 
the process equipment group has multiple market leading brands of process and material handling equipment and systems serving a wide variety of industries across the globe 
batesville is a recognized leader in the north american death care industry 
batesville performs several critical roles within the portfolio 
it serves as the company s core cash generating operation by providing strong annual operating cash flows 
as the source of hillenbrand s strong core competencies  including lean  strategy management  and talent development  it provides talent to imbed these core competencies in acquired companies 
batesville s performance has allowed management to invest in acquisitions that provide diversification  with a focus on companies with growth opportunities and an ability to benefit from hillenbrand s strong core competencies 
we believe we can most effectively continue to increase shareholder value by leveraging our strong financial position and core competencies to continue to build a global diversified industrial company with strong positions in multiple growth oriented industries 
on march   kenneth a 
camp notified the board of directors of hillenbrand of his intent to retire as president  ceo  and a director 
hillenbrand s board of directors thereafter announced its decision to transfer these leadership roles to hillenbrand executive  joe a 
raver 
mr 
camp stepped down from his executive and directorial positions on september   to effect a smooth transition of leadership to mr 
raver prior to mr 
camp s planned retirement as an employee of hillenbrand on december  in addition to his role as hillenbrand s president  ceo  and director  mr 
raver also continues to serve as president of the process equipment group 
another significant event in was our acquisition of coperion capital gmbh coperion  on december   in a transaction valued at based in stuttgart  germany  coperion is a global leader in the manufacturing of compounding  extrusion  and material handling equipment used in a broad range of industries  including plastics  chemicals  food processing  pharmaceutical  and aluminum 
coperion has been in business since  operates nine manufacturing sites in germany  the united states us  china  and india  and has sales offices in approximately locations in the americas  europe  and asia 
approximately one third of coperion s revenue is derived from replacement parts and service  generating a large portion of recurring business due to its well positioned service network and active installed base of equipment across the world 
coperion revenues consist of large system sales  equipment  components  replacement parts  and service 
large system sales are generally fulfilled over to months  during which customers generally pay a deposit and make progress payments before and during the manufacture of the order 
working capital requirements for coperion generally range from an optimal negative working capital position  where cash received from customers is more heavily weighted toward the beginning of the project  to our current position where a larger portion of the cash will be received in later stages of manufacturing 
the coperion business model includes large system projects  where strong application and process engineering expertise is used to create a broad system solution for customers 
a certain amount of revenue for large system sales comes from third party sourced products that carry only a small up charge 
as a result  margins are lower on these large system sales when compared to the rest of the business 
hillenbrand believes that selling these complete systems provides a significant competitive advantage and increases margin dollars 
the coperion acquisition was the largest in the company s history and represented an important step in the execution of our strategic plans to further diversify hillenbrand and accelerate the growth of the process equipment group 
the integration of coperion with the process equipment group will continue to be a key initiative for the next months 
combining our product offerings to provide a more complete system solution is our highest priority from an integration perspective 
in addition  we believe leveraging coperion s global infrastructure will enable the existing businesses within the process equipment group to enter new global markets more quickly 
we also expect the process equipment group s existing strong us sales network will enhance coperion s expansion in north america 
finally  the application of the company s lean tools and other core competencies to coperion s operations is expected to contribute to improved margins and increased customer satisfaction 
the calculation of fair value of coperion s assets and liabilities is preliminary and subject to adjustment based on finalization of the closing balance sheet 
the fair value assigned to coperion s backlog was and was amortized over months 
the fair values assigned to coperion s customer relationships and technology total and will be amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the fair value assigned to coperion s inventory resulted in a step up in value of  and was amortized through cost of goods sold over months 
the fair value assigned to coperion s property  plant  and equipment resulted in a step up in value of  and will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets 
the acquisition resulted in preliminary goodwill of

changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on revenue year over year 
the process equipment group s revenue increased due to the acquisition of coperion in december revenue for the rest of the process equipment group decreased primarily due to the expected sharp reduction in demand for equipment that processes proppants 
demand for this type of equipment spiked dramatically in the second quarter of and continued at relatively high levels before dropping off dramatically at the end of the fourth quarter of to a lesser degree  lower demand for equipment that is used in the potash industry also impacted revenue

this is evident both in the process equipment group  which is continuing to mature in these practices  and batesville  where lean has evolved to an advanced level with projects such as single point scheduling to connect its entire value chain 
interest expense increased due primarily to borrowings in connection with the coperion acquisition  which led to higher weighted average principal borrowings and higher interest rates on the revolving credit facility as well as interest expense incurred on the new term loan

demand for this type of equipment spiked dramatically in the second quarter of and continued at relatively high levels before dropping off dramatically at the end of the fourth quarter of to a lesser degree  lower demand for equipment used in the potash industry also impacted revenue 
we believe that the industries the process equipment group serves have attractive long term growth prospects because of the increase in demand resulting from the expanding middle class in countries such as china and india 
while overall demand for process equipment group products is expected to increase over the long run  we expect demand to shift from time to time 
these shifts can be attributed to the cyclicality of these industries  as demonstrated in the proppants market in  or by long term capacity expansions  as demonstrated currently with the building and expansion of polyolefin plants 
we expect future revenue for the process equipment group to continue to be influenced by order backlog because of the lead time involved in fulfilling engineered to order equipment for customers 
though backlog can be an indicator of future revenue  it does not include projects and parts orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter 
the timing of order placement  size of orders  extent of order customization  and customer delivery dates can create fluctuations in backlog and revenue 
revenue attributable to backlog is also affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than us dollars

liquidity and capital resources we believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths 
in this section  we discuss our ability to generate and access cash to meet business needs 
we describe actual results in generating and utilizing cash by comparing to we discuss how we see cash flow being affected for the next months 
while it is not a certainty  we explain where we think the cash will come from and how we intend to use it 
finally  we identify other significant matters that could affect liquidity on an ongoing basis 
we believe the twelve month outlook for our business remains strong 
as a result of our expected cash flows from operations  we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments including working capital needs  capital expenditures  and financing obligations 
our debt financing includes long term notes  a term loan  and a revolving credit facility  as part of our overall financing strategy 
we believe we continue to have ready access to capital markets and regularly review the optimal mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
in addition to cash balances and our ability to access long term financing  we had of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility as of september  the available borrowing capacity reflects a reduction of for outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility 
the company has the ability to increase the total borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility by an additional subject to approval of the lenders 
in the normal course of business  the process equipment group provides to certain customers bank guarantees and other credit arrangements in support of performance  warranty  advance payment  and other contractual obligations 
this form of trade finance is customary in the industry and  as a result  we are required to maintain adequate capacity to provide the guarantees 
as of september   we had credit arrangements totaling  under which was utilized for this purpose 
these arrangements include a syndicated letter of guarantee facility lg facility entered into on june   under which unsecured letters of credit  bank guarantees  or other surety bonds may be issued 
the lg facility matures on june   or earlier  should we elect to discontinue or fail to replace our primary credit facility which expires on july  the company has the ability to increase the total capacity under the lg facility by an additional subject to approval of the lenders

certain projects underway have payment schedules where a large portion of the cash will be received in later stages of manufacturing 
the terms of these deposits and progress payments vary greatly among industries and geographies 
working capital requirements for coperion generally range from an optimal negative working capital position  where cash received from customers is more heavily weighted toward the beginning of the project  to our current position where a larger portion of the cash will be received in later stages of manufacturing 
we expect working capital may fluctuate in the future due to the mix and geography of customer projects in process at any point in time

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this section  we tell you about market risks we think could have a significant impact on our bottom line or the financial strength of our company 
the term market risk generally means how results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities could be affected by market factors such as interest rates  currency exchange rates  the value of commodities  and debt and equity price risks 
if those factors change significantly  it could help or hurt our bottom line  depending on how we react to them 
we are exposed to various market risks 
we have established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
our primary exposures are to fluctuations in market prices for purchases of certain commodities  volatility in interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility and term loan  volatility in the fair value of our investments  and variability in exchange rates in foreign locations 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel  wood  red metals  and fuel 
while these materials are typically available from multiple suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to market price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchasing process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from our larger suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or if our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain supply chain efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 
at september   we had outstanding under our revolving credit facility and outstanding under a related term loan 
we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our revolving credit facility and related term loan  which bear a variable rate of interest that is based upon the lender s base rate or the libor rate 
the interest we pay on our borrowings is dependent on interest rate conditions and the timing of our financing needs 
assuming these borrowings remain at for months  a one percentage point change in the related interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately  a increase in interest rate exposure over we are subject to volatility in our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio included interests in private equity limited partnerships and warrants for the purchase of common stock with an aggregate carrying value of at september  these investments could be adversely affected by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates  default on debt instruments  and other factors 
the changes in the fair value of the limited partnerships underlying investment portfolios can impact us significantly because we record our share of the change in our income statement under the equity method of accounting 
we are subject to variability in foreign currency exchange rates in our international operations 
exposure to this variability is periodically managed through the use of natural hedges and also by entering into currency exchange agreements 
as of september   a change in the foreign exchange rates affecting unhedged balance sheet exposures would have impacted pre tax earnings by less than 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments cta within accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 
using the example above  the hypothetical change in cta would be calculated by multiplying the net assets of our non us operations by a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates 
the result of the appreciation depreciation of all applicable currencies versus the us dollar would be to change shareholders equity by approximately as of september
