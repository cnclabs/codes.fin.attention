item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the lucky friday segment  production at the lucky friday mine was temporarily suspended due to the requirement to remove built up cementitious material from the silver shaft 
as a result  during the first quarter of  we liquidated forward contracts related to forecasted lucky friday base metal sales for total net proceeds of million 
provisional sales sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters  including by product metals  are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfers to the smelter generally at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement 
due to the time elapsed between shipment to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the smelter 
changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement will result in changes to revenues previously recorded upon shipment 
metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control see item a risk factors a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us for more information 
at december   metals contained in concentrates and exposed to future price changes totaled approximately million ounces of silver   ounces of gold   tons of zinc  and  tons of lead 
if the price for each metal were to change by one percent  the change in the total value of the concentrates sold would be approximately million 
however  as noted in commodity price risk management above  we utilize a program designed to mitigate the risk of negative price adjustments with limited mark to market financially settled forward contracts for our zinc and lead sales
