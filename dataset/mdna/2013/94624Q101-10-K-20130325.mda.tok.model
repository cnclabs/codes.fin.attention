the company s net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as the amount of noninterest income  including deposit service charges and gain on the sale of loans into the secondary market  and noninterest expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  federal deposit insurance premiums  occupancy and equipment costs  and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities as more fully described under risk factors above 
business strategy the company s current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized  profitable and community oriented bank dedicated to providing quality service and products to its customers 
the company has sought to implement this strategy in recent years by closely monitoring the needs of customers and providing personal  quality customer service  continuing the origination of a wide array of loan products in the company s market area  managing interest rate risk exposure by better matching asset and liability maturities and rates  increasing fee income  including participation in the secondary mortgage market  managing asset quality  maintaining a strong retail deposit base  maintaining capital in excess of regulatory minimum requirements  and emphasizing the commercial loan program to add high quality  higher yielding and shorter duration assets to the company s loan portfolio 
strategic initiatives as part of the aforementioned business strategy  the company pursues an ongoing strategic planning process  which includes annual plan updates and regular progress reviews by the board of directors

table of contents forward looking statements in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
economic circumstances  the company s operations  and actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and the company s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include  but are not limited to  those with respect to the following matters management s determination of the amount and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the effect of changes in interest rates  management s opinion as to the effects of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements  and management s opinion as to the bank s ability to maintain regulatory capital at current levels 
critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the company considers the allowance for loan losses and related loss provision to be a critical accounting policy 
the company has established a systematic method of periodically reviewing the credit quality of the loan portfolio in order to establish a sufficient allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s current judgments about the credit quality of individual loans and segments of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision  and considers all known internal and external factors that affect loan collectability as of the reporting date 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s knowledge of inherent risks in the portfolio that are probable and reasonably estimable and other factors that warrant recognition in providing an appropriate loan loss allowance 
goodwill the company recorded all assets and liabilities acquired in prior purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required 
goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  customer attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  specific industry conditions and changes in competition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
discussion of financial condition changes december  from december  at december   total assets decreased to million from the million at december  mainly due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million  and a million  or  decrease in securities  partially offset by an increase in loans of million  or  and a million increase in bank owned life insurance 
during the year ended december   the bank originated and retained million of loans  received payments of million and transferred  to foreclosed assets held for sale 
as loan volume increased during the period ended december   management used the cash flow from securities to fund this growth 
the bank also used cash to pay down million of fhlb borrowings as they matured 

table of contents at december  and december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of gross loans and million  or  of gross loans  respectively 
in determining the amount of the loan loss allowance at any point of time  management systematically determines the risk of loss in the portfolio 
first  delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans are evaluated for potential impairment in carrying value 
at december   all delinquent and classified residential  nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans were analyzed  with million of the reserve being allocated to these categories of loans 
the largest loan in this category consisted of a commercial real estate loan amounting to  at december  the company took several partial chargeoffs which reduced this figure from december of million as management evaluated the probability of the repayment of principal 
also assisting this reduction were several relationships which were refinanced in which the bank received additional collateral or repayment 
the second step in determining the allowance for loan losses entails the application of historic loss experience to individual loan types in the portfolio 
in addition to the historic loss percentage  management employs an additional risk percentage tailored to the perception of the overall risk in the economy 
finally  to provide additional assurance regarding the validity of the commercial loan risk rating system  management engages a third party loan reviewer who provides independent validation of the bank s loan grading process 
management recorded a  provision for losses on loans for the year ended december   a decrease of  from the  recorded for the nine months ended december  goodwill of million is carried on the company s balance sheet as a result of the acquisition of stebbins bancshares in june in accordance with fasb asc  this goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
management evaluated the goodwill using an analysis of required measures of value  including the current stock price as an indicator of minority interest value  change of control multiples as a measure of controlling interest value and discounted cash flow analysis as a measure of going concern value and applied a weighting based on appraisal standards to arrive at a valuation conclusion that indicated no impairment at december  a prepaid asset of million was created in the third fiscal quarter of due to the fdic imposing a prepaid assessment on all insured institutions  including the company s subsidiary 
the amount of the prepaid premium covered the fourth calendar quarter of and all of calendar years  and and included a deposit growth assumption 
actual deposit insurance premium expense is calculated by the fdic on a quarterly basis  with the expense being charged to the prepaid asset 
any balance remaining in june  will be refunded to the company s subsidiary bank 
the balance at december  was deposits totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  demand accounts increased million  or  and savings and money market accounts increased by million  or  which were offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of million  or 
the company experienced an increase in low cost liquid deposit accounts as customers chose to keep funds in more liquid types of accounts due to the low level of market interest rates and as management exercised discipline during the period with regard to the pricing of retail certificates 
in general  management attempts to benchmark retail certificate of deposit pricing to the cost of alternate sources of funds  including fhlb advances and brokered deposits 
exceptions are made to defend customer relationships with significant value to the bank while allowing rate sensitive certificate of deposit customers with no relationship with the bank to move to other alternatives 
other short term borrowings increased million as a result of an increase in commercial repurchase agreements by rate sensitive customers 
advances from the fhlb decreased million  from million at december  to million at december  mainly due to the maturity of fixed rate and term advances 
during december  the bank prepaid million of existing fixed rate and term advances to reduce the carrying cost and extend the maturity dates of those advances into and to take advantage of the low interest rate environment at that time and to again extend liability duration at a cost lower than the use of retail certificates of deposit 
as part of this restructuring transaction  a  prepayment penalty was paid and deferred 
the remaining unamortized balance of  is reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of advances and will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the new advances 

table of contents at december   stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of  or  compared to the balance at december  this increase is primarily due to million in net income and amortization of the esop shares of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the unrealized gains on available for sale securities of  a reduction in the pension unrecognized net loss of  an unrecognized loss in the split dollar benefit plan of  the repurchase of treasury stock of  and cash dividends totaling  during the year ended december  in august  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to of the company s common stock 
at december   million of retained earnings remained committed to the completion of this program in future periods subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements 
comparison of operating results for the twelve month period ended december  and nine month period ended december  general net income totaled million for the year ended december   and million for the nine months ended december  the increase in net income was primarily attributable to the company s change in fiscal year end to december  from march  resulting in a nine month period ended december  compared to a twelve month period ended december  interest income interest income increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the nine months ended december  the interest income increased for the period ended december  mainly due to the twelve month current period compared to the december  nine month period 
this aforementioned increase was partially offset by a decline in the average yield on interest earning assets of basis points to for december   from for the nine month period ending december  causing a decline in interest income of million as a result of the overall market rate decline 
these rate decreases have negatively affected the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets 
additionally  there was also a decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets to million for the year ended december   from million for the nine months ended december  interest income on loans increased million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the nine months ended december   due primarily to a shortened fiscal year end period ended december  and an increase of million  or  in the average balance of loans for the period ended december   partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on loans outstanding to 
the decrease in the yield was due to the decrease in market interest rates and the corresponding downward impact on new originations 
interest income on securities increased  or  during the twelve months ended december   compared to the nine months ended december   due primarily to a twelve month fiscal period ended december   offset with a decline of basis points in the weighted average yield to as compared to  for the nine month fiscal year ended december   generally reflecting reinvestment in lower yielding mortgage backed securities as higher yielding securities prepaid or matured  as well as a decrease of million  or  in the average balance 

table of contents interest expense interest expense for the twelve months ended december   totaled million  a decrease of  or  compared to interest expense for the nine months ended december  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the weighted average cost of funds of basis points to for the fiscal period ended december   and a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of deposits and borrowings outstanding  partially offset by twelve months in the current year period  compared to the nine months in the prior period ended december  interest expense on deposits totaled million for the twelve months ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to the nine months ended december  the decrease in deposit costs resulted from a decrease of basis points in the weighted average cost of deposits to for the fiscal period ended december   and a decrease in the average balance outstanding of  partially offset by twelve months in the current year period  compared to the nine months in the prior period ended december  in addition  a shift in the composition of deposits from higher cost time deposits to lower cost checking  money market and savings accounts contributed to the decrease in the cost of deposits  along with a general decline in overall market rates 
interest expense on other short term borrowings totaled  for both the twelve and nine months ended december  and there was an increase of  due to the nine month period ended december  due primarily to three additional months combined with an average balance increase of million  or in fiscal  fully offset by a decrease in the weighted average cost of other short term borrowings to in the current year period from for the nine months ended december  interest expense on federal home loan bank advances totaled  for the twelve months ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to the nine months ended december   due primarily to a decrease in the average balance of million  or  combined with a rate decline of basis points to for the fiscal period ended december   partially offset by twelve months in the current year period  compared to the nine months in the prior period ended december  the decrease in the average balance was due to higher rate advance maturities  as funds from deposit growth were used to repay advances 
net interest income net interest income totaled million for the twelve month period ended december   an increase of million  or  from the amount for the nine month fiscal year ended december  the increase in net interest income was mainly due to the twelve month fiscal year partially offset with the repricing effect of the overall low rate environment 
the average interest rate spread increased to for the twelve month period ended december  the net interest margin also increased to for the year ended december  the basis point decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets was more than offset by the basis point decrease in the cost of funds 
as noted earlier  a decrease in overall market interest rates and shift in the composition of deposits from higher cost time deposits to lower cost checking  money market and savings accounts contributed to the decrease in the cost of deposits 
provision for losses on loans the company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling  for the twelve months ended december   compared to  for the nine months ended december  the principal reason for the high level of provision for loans loss was due to increased chargeoffs related to commercial real estate properties partially offset with refinancings in which the bank received additional collateral reducing the amounts required to be allocated within the allowance for loan losses to address loans individually evaluated for impairment 
in the opinion of management  as of december   the carrying value of all non performing loans as of december   is expected to be realized 

table of contents noninterest income noninterest income  consisting primarily of earnings on bank owned life insurance policies  gains on sale of loans  trust income and deposit service fees increased by  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the nine months ended december  the increase was primarily due to the nine month fiscal period ended december  compared to the twelve month year ended december   and a  increase in gain on sale of loans 
as described under item above  management engages in sales of newly originated loans to limit the buildup of interest rate risk on the balance sheet and to provide liquidity to accommodate additional refinancing activity 
the company sold million of loans during the nine months ended december  compared to million during fiscal year ended december  noninterest expense noninterest expense increased by million  or  totaling million for the twelve month period ended december  the increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to increased operating expenses due to the short nine month fiscal period ended december  compared to the full twelve month period ended december  the company also incurred additional costs to complete the trust transfer and assumption agreement with thomasville national bank of approximately  benefits costs increased primarily from increased employee healthcare and other employee benefit costs combined with additional staffing for the marketing initiative to increase the community s awareness of the bank s products and services 
also the company incurred other operating costs related to the strategic marketing program of a direct mail campaign and additional consulting services to negotiate vendor contracts 
federal income taxes provision for federal income taxes was  for the twelve months ended december   reflecting an increase of  from the nine months ended december   primarily due to a  increase in pre tax income  partially offset by additional tax exempt income recognized during the twelve months ended december  the difference in the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  from the statutory rate was mainly due to the beneficial effects of income from the cash surrender value of life insurance and other tax exempt obligations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal repayments and prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank manages the pricing of deposits to maintain a desired level of deposits and cost of funds 
in addition  bank invests excess funds in federal funds and other short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
liquid assets outstanding at december  and december   totaled million and million  respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from the company s operating  financing and investing activities  see the statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a major portion of the bank s liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of operating  investing and financing activities 
the primary sources of cash are net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from deposits and advances from the fhlb  and sales of residential mortgage loans and investment securities 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if the bank requires liquidity beyond its ability to generate funds internally at a reasonable cost  borrowing agreements are in place with the fhlb  which provide an additional source of funds 
as noted above  fhlb advances are used as part of an overall liability management strategy to extend duration for interest rate risk management purposes generally at a cost lower than equivalent duration retail certificates 
at december   the company had million in outstanding advances from the fhlb  offset with a prepayment penalty of  due to the restructuring of three fhlb advances as described above 
at december   the company had additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb totaling million based on the bank s one to four family residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  home equity lines of credit  second mortgage loans and multi family loans 
the bank also has pledged million to secure a line of credit with the federal reserve bank of million which is in place to provide a backup  short term source of liquidity 
the bank has the ability to pledge remaining market value of investment and mortgage backed securities of million which would allow the bank the ability to borrow additional longer term funds from the fhlb

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that interest earning assets reprice at a different time than interest bearing liabilities 
as part of its effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  the bank uses the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the regulators as part of its interest rate sensitivity regulations 
the application of npv methodology illustrates certain aspects of the bank s interest rate risk 
generally  npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the npv  which would result from a theoretical change in market interest rates 
presented below  as of december  and  is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained  and basis point basis point equals 
increases and a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from time deposits would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
as of december  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp   
table of contents as of december  change in net portfolio value net portfolio value interest rates as of pv of assets basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp  the company attempts to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
strategies include originating arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investment and mortgage backed securities and extending liabilities through promoting cost effective long term retail time deposits or the use of long term fhlb advances 
however  particularly in the current interest rate and credit market environment  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
accordingly  arm loan originations were very limited during the fiscal year ended december  similarly  depositors currently prefer more liquid and short duration checking  money market and savings accounts to longer term time deposits 
the net effect of this continuing shift in customer preference for longer duration loans and shorter duration deposits has been to expose the company to increased interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability management committee alco  which is responsible for reviewing the company s asset liability policies 
the committee meets and reports monthly to the board of directors on interest rate risks and trends  as well as liquidity and capital ratios and requirements 
the bank has operated within the framework of its prescribed npv risk range for each of the last three years
