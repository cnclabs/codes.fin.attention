terahertz systems subsystems utilizing iii v materials for terahertz transmitters or receivers 
terahertz technology one of the high growth technologies we are pursuing is terahertz based on our t ray product platforms 
thz is a region of the electromagnetic spectrum that lies between microwave and infrared waves and is in the early stages of adoption 
while microwaves and infrared waves have been explored and commercialized for decades  thz waves are in the early stages of being explored and commercialized due to the fact that they have historically been very difficult to generate and detect 
recent advances in femtosecond lasers and ultra fast semiconductor and electro optic devices combined with fiber optic packaging technologies have enabled the development of practical t ray instrumentation for the research market with increasing adoption in the industrial  military and aerospace markets as a result of our growing group of value added resellers application and market development efforts 
thz can be used to look through and beneath materials with high dimensional d and dimensional d spatial resolution roughly equivalent to the resolution of the human eye or better 
it can also uniquely identify the chemical composition of many hidden or subsurface objects using non ionizing radiation  which is not harmful to humans at the power levels commonly used today 
thz imaging and spectroscopy market applications include industrial quality control through non destructive testing including aerospace and pharmaceutical markets  homeland security and defense screening of people  packages and bags for weapons and weapons of mass destruction  medical imaging and other scientific applications 
we have had significant terahertz technology and product development since  resulting in patents or patents pending to date 
in  we sold the first commercial thz product  the t ray  as a laboratory bench top instrument for application development with spectroscopy and imaging capabilities targeted at the research and development and off line diagnostic markets 
in  we sold the first t ray manufacturing inspection system qa for on line  real time inspection to nasa for the space shuttle fuel tank inspection in the return to flight program 
in march  we shipped our next generation thz imaging and spectroscopy system t ray 
the t ray is significantly smaller  lighter  and more powerful than previous thz generations and incorporates significant technological advancements 
the system weighs pounds and is the size of a briefcase  which is a significant reduction from the pound refrigerator size qa in  we introduced our fifth generation product called t gauge  which weighs pounds 
this product is targeted at the industrial  ndt and process quality control market 
we have established and continue to develop a value added reseller var network to accelerate adoption in vertical industrial markets  initially targeting the nuclear gauge replacement market 
to date  we have entered into var agreements with three established industrial process and quality control companies 
in november  we entered into a development agreement with in q tel inc in q tel to develop and deliver three anomaly detection systems for evaluation purposes by the transportation security administration tsa 
in  we introduced the saf t chek ads anomaly detection system  in satisfaction of the in q tel contract 
the saf t chek ads systems have been recommended for inclusion on the standardized equipment list  for ultimate inclusion into the qualified products list qpl for use in non airport screening intermodal 
further development will be required on automatic detection algorithms to make the product suitable for passenger screening 
in  we entered into a multi year application development contracts with the us air force for use of the t ray product platform for automated and manual manufacturing quality control on the next generation joint strike fighter f 
contract options totaling million to deliver and demonstrate systems on the manufacturing floor were exercised in the fourth quarter of our fiscal and the efforts are expected to be completed in the first half of our fiscal markets our products serve customers in a variety of global markets  typically north america  asia  europe and australia 
the target markets and applications served by us are as follows military space defense industrial ndt manufacturing  process and quality control test and measurement medical diagnostic monitoring ophthalmic equipment medical imaging telecommunications long haul metro transmission enterprise access transmission comtest government homeland security baggage cargo scanning passenger screening raw materials our principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are silicon and iii v material inp  gaas wafers  chemicals  gases and metals used in processing wafers  gold wire  solders  electronic components  high speed specialized semiconductor amplifiers  pic s  and a variety of packages and substrates  including metal  printed circuit board  flex circuits  ceramic and plastic packages 
all of these raw materials can be obtained from several suppliers 
however  we depend on suppliers whose components have been qualified into our products and who could disrupt our business if they stop  decrease or delay shipments or if the components they ship have quality or consistency issues 
from time to time  particularly during periods of increased industry wide demand  silicon wafers  iii v wafers inp  gaas  certain metal packages and other materials have been in short supply 
during fiscal and  we or our customers were adversely affected by supply chain disruptions caused by the natural disaster that occurred in japan and thailand 
in the second half of fiscal  we were affected by limitations in supply of a critical component used in our g hsor product which limited our revenues 
in the press release dated june   we announced that these supplier bottlenecks had been alleviated 
in the future  any significant increase in lead times or shortage in supply on critical components could reduce future growth 
research and development since our inception in june  we have incurred material research and development r d expenses  with the intent of commercializing these investments into profitable new standard and custom product offerings 
during the fiscal years ended in and  research and development expenses were million and million  respectively  which we believe was adequate to maintain the necessary investment in our future growth platforms 
we will continue to pursue government funded  as well as internally funded  research and development projects when they are in support of the our development objectives 
during fiscal years and  approximately million and million of our r d spending was government funded  respectively 
as we begin the new fiscal year  the following research and development projects are currently underway hsor next generation photodiodes and high speed optical receivers for the g  g and g telecommunications market o next generation g dp qpsk coherent receivers for long haul and metro markets 
o st generation g nrz apd s for the enterprise access market 
o th generation integrated g nrz for the enterprise access market 
o st generation g apd for the fiber to the premises fttx o st generation apd for battlefield communications terahertz applications and enhancements to support market penetration 
o application and software development utilizing the t gauge  product platform for industrial quality and process control markets 
o t gauge  platform cost reduction initiatives 
o next generation subsystems to support various vertical market requirements 
custom optoelectronics pin and subassembly developments 
o custom pin photodiode subassembly focused in the test and measurement currency validation market 
o next generation custom pin photodiode for an agricultural application 
environmental regulations the photonics industry  as well as the semiconductor industry in general  is subject to governmental regulations for the protection of the environment  including those relating to air and water quality  solid and hazardous waste handling  and the promotion of occupational safety 
various federal  state and local laws and regulations require that we maintain certain environmental permits 
we believe we have obtained all necessary environmental permits required to conduct our manufacturing processes 
changes in the aforementioned laws and regulations or the enactment of new laws  regulations or policies could require increases in operating costs and additional capital expenditures and could possibly entail delays or interruptions of operations 
backlog and customers our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from sales to oems pursuant to individual purchase orders with short lead times 
however  by industry practice  orders may be canceled or modified at any time 
accordingly  we do not believe that the backlog of undelivered product under these purchase orders is a meaningful indicator of our future financial performance 
when customers cancel an order  they are responsible for all finished goods  all incurred costs  direct and indirect  as well as a reasonable allowance for anticipated profits 
no assurance can be given that we will receive these amounts after cancellation 
customers normally purchase our products and incorporate them into products that they in turn sell in their own markets on an ongoing basis 
as a result  our sales are dependent upon the success of our customers products and our future performance is dependent upon our success in finding new customers and receiving new orders from existing customers 
marketing in the united states and canada  we market our products through a mix of technical sales engineers  salesmen  value added resellers  and independent sales representatives 
international sales  including europe  the middle east  far east and asia  are conducted directly by the technical sales engineers and at times in conjunction with foreign distributors  value added resellers and representatives 
our products are primarily sold as components or sub assemblies to oems and we market our products and capabilities through industry specific channels  including the internet  industry trade shows  and in print through trade journals 
competition in our target markets  we compete with different companies in each of our three major product platforms custom optoelectronic  high speed optical receiver and thz systems 
we believe that our principal competitors for sales of custom optoelectronic products are small and medium size private companies and medium size public companies such as first sensor  excelitas  a division of illinois tool works itw  and a division of osi systems osis 
in the high speed optical receiver market  certain product lines compete against some mix of the following competitors  jds uniphase jdsu  neophotonix nptn  ut  avago  a division of fujitsu foc  a division of nippon electric nel and several other smaller companies 
because the thz product offering includes developing technology applications and markets  we believe the competition is mainly from several early stage small private companies supported by research institutions like the fraunhofer institute in germany  advantest and the use of alternative technologies  mainly nuclear gauges that are bundled with other process control equipment within divisions of several larger public companies 
because we specialize in devices requiring a high degree of engineering expertise to meet the requirements of specific applications  we generally do not compete with other large united states  european or asian manufacturers of standard off the shelf optoelectronic components or silicon photodetectors 
proprietary technology we utilize proprietary design rules and processing steps in the development and fabrication of our pin and apd photodiodes  thz transmitters and receivers  fiber coupled thz subsystems systems  and thz applications

the cost of litigation to uphold the validity and to prevent the infringement of a patent could be substantial 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our technology will not infringe on patents or rights owned by others  the licenses to which might not be available to us at all or on reasonable terms 
based on limited patent searches  contacts with others knowledgeable in the field of our technology  and a review of the published materials  we believe that our competitors hold no patents  licenses or other rights to technology which would preclude us from pursuing our intended operations 
in some cases  we may rely on trade secrets to protect our innovations 
there can be no assurance that trade secrets will be established  that secrecy obligations will be honored or that others will not independently develop similar or superior technology 
to the extent that consultants  key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our projects  disputes might arise as to the proprietary rights to such information which may not be resolved in our favor

risk factors investing in our class a common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before investing in our class a common stock 
our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to any of the following risks 
in that case  the value of our class a common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to our business we are subject to the cyclical nature of the markets in which we compete and any future downturn may reduce demand for our products and revenue 
many factors beyond our control affect our industry  including consumer confidence in the economy  interest rates  fuel prices and the general availability of credit 
the overall economic climate and changes in gross national product growth has a direct impact on our customers and the demand for our products 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be adversely affected as a result of an industry or general economic downturn 
our customers may reduce capital expenditures and have difficulty satisfying liquidity needs because of continued turbulence in the us and global economies  resulting in reduced sales of our products and harm to our financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  our historical results of operations have been subject to substantial fluctuations  and we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future results of operations 
any future downturn in the markets in which we compete could significantly reduce the demand for our products and therefore may result in a significant reduction in revenue 
it may also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock 
our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected in the future due to changes in demand from customers or cyclical changes in the markets utilizing our products 
in addition  the telecommunications industry  has  from time to time  experienced  and may again experience  a pronounced downturn 
to respond to a downturn  many service providers may slow their capital expenditures  cancel or delay new developments  reduce their workforces and inventories and take a cautious approach to acquiring new equipment and technologies from original equipment manufacturers like us  which would have a negative impact on our business 
weakness in the global economy or a future downturn in the telecommunications industry may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year  harm our business  and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock 
we may be unable to obtain financing to fund ongoing operations and future growth 
during fiscal year  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to  as of march  consequently  our current cash balance  potential future cash flows from operations  combined with our accessibility to cash and credit  may not be sufficient to allow us to finance ongoing operations or to make required investments for future growth if we are unable to acheive the revenue growth that we have projected for fiscal year the past disruption in credit markets and our recent operating losses make it uncertain whether we will be able to continue to access the credit or capital markets when necessary or desirable 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if  when required  adequate funds are unavailable  or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance our products  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
we have previously violated certain covenants under our loan agreements and may not be able to comply with covenants under our new credit facilities or other loans that we may obtain in the future 
on january   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank svb and such other documents which constitute the svb loan agreement and terminated our prior loan agreement with the privatebank and trust company the privatebank loan agreement 
on october   we agreed with svb to modify the initial covenants of the svb loan agreement retroactively to the september  quarter end  to revise the interest rate structure  the covenants  and other terms of the svb loan agreement 
on february   we obtained a second amendment to the svb loan agreement to again modify the financial covenants and to waive the restriction on granting any security interest to other parties to permit us to enter into the pfg loan agreement described below 
we entered into a third amendment with svb on or about february  to allow for the net asset purchase of the silonex business for  in cash 
the million secured debt agreement that we entered into with partners for growth iii  lp pfg on february  and which was closed and funded on february  the pfg loan agreement  is subordinated to svb s senior secured position 
we agreed to financial covenants of a minimum rolling three month negative adjusted ebitda of  measured each month from january to june  negative adjusted ebitda of  for each month of july through october  adjusted ebitda of for each month of november through february  and adjusted ebitda of  measured each month thereafter subject to reset based on mutual agreement once a fiscal year budget is submitted to the lenders 
the company is restricted under the agreement from borrowing more than million on the svb line of credit for the first six months of the pfg loan agreement 
while we are currently in compliance with both the svb loan agreement and the pfg loan agreement  we have breached covenants under our prior loan agreements  including the private bank loan agreement 
in light of this history  there can be no assurance that we will not have similar problems under our current credit facilities  and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain waivers or amendments if future covenant violations of the terms of our current loans occur 
failure to obtain such waivers or amendments  if necessary  could materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  could negatively impact our results of operations 
as of march  and march   our consolidated balance sheet included million in goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over amounts assigned to tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our business acquisitions 
our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
any goodwill value in excess of fair value as determined in an impairment test must be written off in the period of determination 
intangible assets other than goodwill are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets 
the carrying value of the intangible assets aggregated to million as of march  from time to time  we may acquire  or make an investment in  a business which may require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets 
we may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business which adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business 
future determinations of significant write offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
customer acceptance of our products is dependent on our ability to meet changing requirements  and any decrease in acceptance could adversely affect our revenue 
customer acceptance of our products is significantly dependent on our ability to offer products that meet the changing requirements of our customers  including telecommunication  military  medical and industrial corporations  as well as government agencies 
any decrease in the level of customer acceptance of our products could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our products must meet exacting specifications  and defects and failures may occur  which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products 
our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality  performance and reliability that our products must meet 
however  our products are highly complex and may contain defects and failures when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products are also subject to rough environments as they are integrated into our customer products for use by the end customers 
if defects and failures occur in our products  we could experience lost revenue  increased costs  including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments  product returns or discounts  diversion of management resources or damage to our reputation and brand equity  and in some cases consequential damages  any of which would harm our operating results 
in addition  delays in our ability to fill product orders as a result of quality control issues may negatively impact our relationship with our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources  including any available insurance  to satisfy any asserted claims 
rapidly changing standards and regulations could make our products obsolete  which would cause our revenue and results of operations to suffer 
we design our products to conform to our customer s requirements and our customer s systems may be subject to regulations established by governments or industry standards bodies worldwide 
because certain of our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards  if competing or new standards emerge that are preferred by our customers  we would have to make significant expenditures to develop new products 
if our customers adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible  or the industry groups adopt standards or governments issue regulations with which our products are not compatible  our existing products would become less desirable to our customers and our revenue and results of operations would suffer 
if any of our products are found to have  or are suspected to have  security vulnerabilities  we could incur significant costs and irreparable damage to our reputation 
if any of our products are found to have significant security vulnerabilities  then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminating such vulnerabilities and to repairing or replacing products already sold or licensed to our customers 
in addition  our customers and potential customers could perceive our products as unreliable  making it more difficult for us to sell our products 
our inability to find new customers or retain existing customers could have a material adverse affect on our business 
customers normally purchase our products and incorporate them into products that they  in turn  sell in their own markets on an ongoing basis 
as a result  our sales are dependent upon the success of our customers products and our future performance is dependent upon our success in finding new customers and receiving new orders from existing customers 
in several of our markets  quality and or reliability of our products are a major concern for our customers  not only upon the initial manufacture of the product  but for the life of the product 
many of our products are used in remote locations for higher value assembly  making servicing of our products unfeasible 
any failure of the quality and or reliability of our products could have an adverse affect on our business 
if our customers do not qualify our products or if their customers do not qualify their products  our results of operations may suffer 
most of our customers do not purchase our products prior to qualification of our products and satisfactory completion of factory audits and vendor evaluation 
our existing products  as well as each new product  must pass through varying levels of qualification with our customers 
in addition  because of the rapid technological changes in our market  a customer may cancel or modify a design project before we begin large scale manufacturing and receive revenues from the customer 
it is unlikely that we would be able to recover the expenses for cancelled or unutilized custom design projects 
it is difficult to predict with any certainty whether our customers will delay or terminate product qualification or the frequency with which customers will cancel or modify their projects 
any such delay  cancellation or modification could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
in addition  once a customer qualifies a particular supplier s product or component  these potential customers design the product into their system  which is known as a design in win 
suppliers whose products or components are not designed in are unlikely to make sales to that customer until at least the adoption of a future redesigned system 
even then  many customers may be reluctant to incorporate entirely new products into their new systems  as doing so could involve significant additional redesign efforts and increased costs 
if we fail to achieve design in wins in our potential customers qualification processes  we will likely lose the opportunity for significant sales to those customers for a lengthy period of time 
if the end user customers that purchase systems from our customers fail to qualify or delay qualifications of any products sold by our customers that contain our products  our business could be harmed 
the qualification and field testing of our customers systems by end user customers is long and unpredictable 
this process is not under our control or that of our customers  and  as a result  the timing of our sales is unpredictable 
any unanticipated delay in qualification of one of our customers products could result in the delay or cancellation of orders from our customers for products included in their equipment  which could harm our results of operations 
our sales to overseas markets expose us to additional  unpredictable risks which could have a material adverse affect on our business and expose us to liability under the foreign corrupt practices act 
a portion of our sales are being derived from overseas markets 
these international sales are primarily focused in asia  europe and the middle east 
these operations are subject to unpredictable risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries and which could have a material adverse affect on our business  including the following foreign countries could change regulations or impose currency restrictions and other restraints  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation in the foreign countries in which we operate  exchange controls  some countries impose burdensome tariffs and quotas  political changes and economic crises may lead to changes in the business environment in which we operate  international conflict  including terrorist acts  could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations  and economic downturns  political instability and war or civil disturbances may disrupt distribution logistics or limit sales in individual markets 
in addition  we utilize third party distributors to act as our representative for the geographic region that they have been assigned as well as value added resellers that have territorial restrictions 
sales through these channels represent approximately of total revenue in fiscal significant terms and conditions of distributor agreements include fob source  net days payment terms  with no return or exchange rights  and no price protection 
since the product title transfers to the distributor at the time of shipment  the products are not considered inventory on consignment 
our success is dependent on these distributors finding new customers and receiving new orders from existing customers 
we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and other laws that prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
our activities in our overseas markets create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees  consultants  sales agents or distributors  because these parties are not always subject to our control 
while it is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices  our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective  and our employees  consultants  sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible 
violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions  and we may be subject to other liabilities  which could negatively affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  certain governmental authorities may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire 
customer demand is difficult to accurately forecast and  as a result  we may be unable to optimally match production with customer demand  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
we make planning and spending decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  and inventory levels  component procurement commitments  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can strain our resources  cause our manufacturing to be negatively impacted by materials shortages  necessitate higher or more restrictive procurement commitments  increase our manufacturing yield loss and scrapping of excess materials  and reduce our gross margin 
we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of our customers  or one or more of our suppliers may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands 
conversely  a downturn in the markets in which our customers compete can cause  and in the past have caused  our customers to significantly reduce or delay the amount of products ordered from us or to cancel existing orders  leading to lower utilization of our facilities 
because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  reduction in customer demand due to market downturns or other reasons would have a material adverse effect on our gross margin  operating income and cash flow 
customer orders and forecasts are subject to cancellation or modification at any time which could result in higher manufacturing costs 
our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
however  by industry practice  orders may be canceled or modified at any time 
when a customer cancels an order  they are responsible for all finished goods  all costs  direct and indirect  incurred by us  as well as a reasonable allowance for anticipated profits 
no assurance can be given that we will receive these amounts after cancellation 
furthermore  uncertainty in customer forecasts of their demands and other factors may lead to delays and disruptions in manufacturing  which could result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our business 
fluctuations and changes in our customers demand are common in our industry 
such fluctuations  as well as quality control problems experienced in our manufacturing operations may cause us to experience delays and disruptions in our manufacturing process and overall operations and reduce our output capacity 
as a result  product shipments could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers or could be cancelled  which would negatively affect our sales  operating income  strategic position at customers  market share and reputation 
in addition  disruptions  delays or cancellations could cause inefficient production which in turn could result in higher manufacturing costs  lower yields and potential excess and obsolete inventory or manufacturing equipment 
in the past  we have experienced such delays  disruptions and cancellations 
the markets for many of our products are characterized by changing technology which could cause obsolescence of our products  and we may incur substantial costs in delivering new products 
the markets for many of our products are characterized by changing technology  new product introductions and product enhancements  and evolving industry standards 
the introduction or enhancement of products embodying new technology or the emergence of new industry standards could render existing products obsolete  and result in a write down to the value of our inventory  or result in shortened product life cycles 
accordingly  our ability to compete is in part dependent on our ability to continually offer enhanced and improved products 
the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
some of our products are used by our customers to develop  test and manufacture their products 
we therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
in developing any new product  we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues 
we depend on key in house manufacturing capabilities and a loss of these capabilities could have an adverse affect on our existing operations and new business growth 
we depend on key in house manufacturing equipment and assembly processes 
we believe that these key manufacturing and assembly processes give us the flexibility and responsiveness to meet our customer delivery schedule and performance specification with a custom product 
this value proposition is an important component of our offering to our customers 
a loss of these capabilities could have an adverse affect on our existing operations and new business growth 
we depend upon an outside contract manufacturer for a portion of the manufacturing process for some of our products 
our operations and revenue related to these products could be adversely affected if we encounter problems with this contract manufacturer 
many of our products are manufactured internally 
however we also rely upon a contract manufacturer in china to produce the finished portion of some of our optoelectronic components 
our reliance on a contract manufacturer for these products makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  manufacturing quality controls and costs 
if the contract manufacturer for our products were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or to continue our existing supply arrangement  we would have to identify  qualify and select an acceptable alternative contract manufacturer or move these manufacturing operations to our internal manufacturing facilities 
an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms  including price 
any significant interruption in manufacturing our products would require us to reduce our supply products to our customers  which in turn would reduce our revenue  harm our relationships with the customers of these products and cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities 
changes in the spending priorities of the federal government can materially adversely affect our business 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales were related to products and services purchased by federal government contractors 
our business relies upon continued federal government expenditures on defense  intelligence  homeland security  aerospace and other programs that we support 
in fiscal  our sales to federal government contractors decreased 
in addition  foreign military sales are affected by us government regulations  regulations by purchasing foreign governments and political uncertainties in the us and abroad 
there can be no assurance that the federal government budget including defense and military will continue to grow or that sales of defense related items to foreign governments will continue at present levels 
the terms of defense contracts with the us government generally permit the government to terminate such contracts  with or without cause  at any time 
any unexpected termination of a significant us government contract with a military contractor to which we sell our products could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we face intense competition which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share 
we compete with a range of companies in our target markets  some of which have greater financial and marketing resources  and greater manufacturing capacity  as well as better established relationships with customers  than we do 
because we specialize in custom high performance devices requiring a high degree of engineering expertise to meet the requirements of specific applications  we generally do not compete to any significant degree with other large united states  european or pacific rim high volume manufacturers of standard off the shelf optoelectronic components 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets against these or any future competitors 
we also face competition from some of our customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally 
due to the fact that such customers are not seeking to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products  they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers 
as a result  these customers may purchase less of our products and there would be additional pressure to lower our selling prices which  accordingly  would negatively impact our revenue and gross margin 
intense competition in our markets could result in aggressive business tactics by our competitors  including aggressively pricing their products or selling older inventory at a discount 
if our current or future competitors utilize aggressive business tactics  including those described above  demand for our products could decline  we could experience delays or cancellations of customer orders  or we could be required to reduce our sales prices 
acquisition and alliance activities by our competitors could disrupt our ongoing business 
from time to time  our competitors acquire or enter into exclusive arrangements with companies with whom we do business or may do business in the future 
reductions in the number of partners with whom we may do business in a particular context may reduce our ability to enter into critical alliances on attractive terms or at all  and the termination of an existing alliance by a business partner may disrupt our operations 
decreases in average selling prices of our products may increase operating losses and net losses  particularly if we are not able to reduce our expenses commensurately 
the market for optical components and subsystems continues to be characterized by declining average selling prices resulting from factors such as increased price competition among optical component and subsystem manufacturers  excess capacity  the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes as manufacturers continue to deploy network and storage systems 
in the last two years  we have observed a significant decline of average selling prices  primarily in the telecommunications market 
we anticipate that average selling prices will continue to decrease in the future in response to product introductions by our competitors or us  or in response to other factors  including price pressures from significant customers 
in order to sustain profitable operations  we must  therefore  reduce the cost of our current designs or continue to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
failure to do so could cause our sales to decline and operating losses to increase 
our cost reduction efforts may not keep pace with competitive pricing pressures 
to remain competitive  we must continually reduce the cost of manufacturing our products through design and engineering changes 
we may not be successful in redesigning our products or delivering our products to market in a timely manner 
we cannot assure you that any redesign will result in sufficient cost reductions enabling us to reduce the price of our products to remain competitive or positively contribute to operating results 
shifts in our product mix may result in declines in gross profit 
our gross profit margins vary among our product platforms  and are generally highest on our terahertz products 
our overall gross profit has fluctuated from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix  the introduction of new products  decreases in average selling prices for older products and our ability to reduce product costs  and these fluctuations are expected to continue in the future 
if our customers decide to buy more of our products with low gross profit margins and fewer of our products with high gross profit margins  our total gross profits could be adversely affected 
environmental regulations could increase operating costs and additional capital expenditures and delay or interrupt operations 
the photonics industry  as well as the semiconductor industry in general  is subject to governmental regulations for the protection of the environment  including those relating to air and water quality  solid and hazardous waste handling  and the promotion of occupational safety 
various federal  state and local laws and regulations require that we maintain certain environmental permits 
while we believe that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits required to conduct our manufacturing processes 
if we were found to be in violation of these laws  we could be subject to governmental fines and liability for damages resulting from such violations 
changes in the aforementioned laws and regulations or the enactment of new laws  regulations or policies could require increases in operating costs and additional capital expenditures and could possibly entail delays or interruptions of operations 
if we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect those we have  our business would be materially harmed 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and internal procedures  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
for example  we utilize proprietary design rules and processing steps in  among other things  the development and fabrication of our pin photodiodes  apd photodiodes and our thz systems and sensors 
in addition  our products rely upon over patents or patents pending 
there can be no assurance that any issued patents will provide us with significant competitive advantages  or that challenges will not be instituted against the validity or enforceability of any patent utilized by us  or  if instituted  that such challenges will not be successful 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity and to prevent the infringement of a patent could be substantial and could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our technology  which we are constantly developing  will not infringe on patents or rights owned by others  licenses to which might not be available to us 
while we have conducted limited due diligence and have conferred with experts with respect to  among other things  our proprietary materials which we incorporate into our pin photodiodes  apd photodiodes and our thz systems and sensors  there can be no assurance that we have not overlooked or misinterpreted the status of the proprietary rights and intellectual property of others with respect to these products 
the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not adequately prevent misappropriation or ensure that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
other companies may be investigating or developing other technologies that are similar to our own 
it is possible that patents may not be issued from any of our pending applications or those we may file in the future and  if patents are issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to deter or prohibit others from making  using or selling products that are similar to ours 
we do not own patents in every country in which we sell or distribute our products  and thus others may be able to offer identical products in countries where we do not have intellectual property protection 
in addition  the laws of some territories in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including europe  asia pacific or latin america  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in some cases  we may rely on trade secrets to protect our innovations 
there can be no assurance that trade secrets will be established  that secrecy obligations will be honored or that others will not independently develop similar or superior technology 
to the extent that consultants  key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our projects  disputes might arise as to the proprietary rights to such information which may not be resolved in our favor 
pursuing infringers of our intellectual property rights can be difficult and costly 
policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation  unauthorized use or other infringement of our intellectual property rights 
pursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs  and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased sales 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection 
further  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or other infringement in foreign countries where we have not applied for patent protections  and where effective patent  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws may be unavailable  or may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as us law 
we seek to secure  to the extent possible  comparable intellectual property protections in china and other areas in which we operate 
moreover  the level of protection afforded by patent and other laws in countries such as china may not be comparable to that afforded in the us protecting our intellectual property is difficult especially after our employees or our third party contractors end their employment or engagement 
we may have employees leave us and go to work for competitors 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology 
we may be involved in intellectual property disputes in the future  which could divert management s attention  cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology 
participants in the markets in which we sell our products have experienced litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
numerous patents in these industries are held by others  including our competitors 
in addition  third parties may claim that we  or our products  operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights  and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our assets  technology and products 
regardless of their merit  responding to such claims can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses 
while we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon the intellectual property rights of other parties and or believe that a meritorious defense would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary  we cannot be certain that our products would not be found to infringe upon the rights of others 
intellectual property claims against us could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following obtain from a third party claiming infringement a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  stop manufacturing  selling  incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property  pay substantial monetary damages  or expend significant resources to redesign the products that use the technology and to develop non infringing technology 
any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time 
if we fail to obtain the right to use the intellectual property rights of others which are necessary to operate our business  and to protect their intellectual property  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
in the past  we have licensed certain terahertz technology for use in our products 
in the future  we may choose  or be required  to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products 
we cannot assure you that third party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our competitors may be able to obtain licenses  or cross license their technology  on better terms than we can  which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
also  we typically enter into confidentiality agreements with such third parties in which we agree to protect and maintain their proprietary and confidential information  including requiring our employees to enter into agreements protecting such information 
there can be no assurance that the confidentiality agreements will not be breached by any of our employees or that such third parties will not make claims that their proprietary information has been disclosed 
we face strong competition for skilled workers which could result in our inability to attract and retain necessary personnel 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical  management  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of our business 
we may not be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions  which could result in our not achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition  the disruption of our business and an increase in our costs 
our ability to continue to grow may depend upon identifying and successfully acquiring attractive companies  effectively integrating these companies  achieving cost efficiencies and managing these businesses as part of our company 
we may not be able to effectively integrate the acquired companies and successfully implement appropriate operational  financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions 
our efforts to integrate these businesses could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as regulatory developments  general economic conditions and increased competition 
in addition  the process of integrating these businesses could cause the interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our existing business 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of these businesses could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not develop 
future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity 
if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash  the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt 
this acquisition financing would likely increase our ratio of debt to equity and adversely affect other leverage criteria 
under our existing svb loan agreement and pfg loan agreement  we are required to obtain consent prior to incurring additional indebtedness beyond a certain dollar amount 
we cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required 
if we were to undertake an acquisition for equity  the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock 
we may be liable for damages based on product liability claims relating to defects in our products which might be brought against us directly  or against our customers in their end use markets 
such claims could result in a loss of customers in addition to substantial liability in damages 
our products are complex and undergo quality testing as well as formal qualification  both by our customers and by us 
however  defects may occur from time to time 
our customers testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios and over varying amounts of time 
for various reasons  such as the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products age or are operated under peak stress conditions  our products may fail to perform as expected long after customer acceptance 
failures could result from faulty components or design  problems in manufacturing or other unforeseen reasons 
as a result  we could incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty  particularly when such failures occur in installed systems 
in addition  we may in certain circumstances honor warranty claims after the warranty has expired or for problems not covered by warranty in order to maintain customer relationships 
any significant product failure could result in lost future sales of the affected product and other products  as well as customer relations problems  litigation and damage to our reputation 
in addition  our products are typically embedded in  or deployed in conjunction with  our customers products  which incorporate a variety of components  modules and subsystems and may be expected to interoperate with modules produced by third parties 
as a result  not all defects are immediately detectable  and  when problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems or loss of customers  all of which would harm our business 
furthermore  many of our products may provide critical performance attributes to our customers products that will be sold to end users who could potentially bring product liability suits in which we could be named as a defendant 
the sale of these products involves the risk of product liability claims 
if a person were to bring a product liability suit against one of our customers  this customer may attempt to seek contribution from us 
a person may also bring a product liability claim directly against us 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims against us in excess of our insurance coverage for payments  for which we are not otherwise indemnified  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have acquired product liability coverage of up to million 
our current and planned systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  the dodd frank act and the rules adopted or proposed by the sec  will result in increased costs to us as we evaluate the implications of any new rules and respond to their requirements 
new rules could make it more difficult or more costly for us to comply with regulatory requirements  including our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of the exchange act  and obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with any new rules and regulations  or if compliance can be achieved 
we have incurred significant losses in prior periods and may incur losses in the future 
we have incurred significant losses in prior periods 
we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended march  and ended the period with an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we recorded net losses of million and million for the years ended march  and respectively 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient revenue growth to offset expenses or to achieve profitability in future periods 
we may dispose of or discontinue existing product lines and technology developments  which may adversely impact our future results 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our various product offerings and technology developments in order to determine whether any should be discontinued or  to the extent possible  divested 
we cannot guarantee that we have correctly forecasted  or will correctly forecast in the future  the right product lines and technology developments to dispose or discontinue or that our decision to dispose of or discontinue various investments  products lines and technology developments is prudent if market conditions change 
in addition  there are no assurances that the discontinuance of various product lines will reduce our operating expenses or will not cause us to incur material charges associated with such decision 
furthermore  the discontinuance of existing product lines entails various risks  including the risk that we will not be able to find a purchaser for a product line or the purchase price obtained will not be equal to at least the book value of the net assets for the product line 
other risks include managing the expectations of  and maintaining good relations with  our customers who previously purchased products from our disposed or discontinued product lines  which could prevent us from selling other products to them in the future 
we may also incur other significant liabilities and costs associated with our disposal or discontinuance of product lines  including employee severance costs and excess facilities costs 
we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure 
we rely to a large extent on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure 
the size and complexity of these systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown  malicious intrusion  and random attack 
likewise  confidentiality or data privacy breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that trade secrets  personal information  or other sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 
while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology  there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 
we may be unable to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our income taxes  which could adversely affect our future financial results 
as of march   we had net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards for us federal and state tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
as these net operating losses have not been utilized  a portion has begun to expire in the current year 
the utilization of the nol and tax credit carryforwards are subject to a substantial limitation imposed by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  and similar state provisions 
we recorded deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  for the nol carryforwards currently available after considering any existing section limitation 
if we incur an additional limitation under section  then the nol carryforwards  as disclosed  could be reduced by the impact of any future limitation that would result in existing nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards expiring unutilized 
risks relating to our class a common stock our share price has been volatile in the past and may decline in the future 
our class a common stock common stock has experienced significant market price and volume fluctuations in the past and may experience significant market price and volume fluctuations in the future in response to factors such as the following  some of which are beyond our control quarterly variations in our operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in the status of our intellectual property rights  announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of our common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into shares of common stock  stock market price and volume fluctuations  and general economic conditions 
stock markets often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions  such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations or political events or hostilities in or surrounding the united states  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources both of which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price  and conversion of our warrants or stock options and any additional capital raised by us may dilute your ownership 
we may sell additional shares of common stock in the future 
in addition  holders of warrants or stock options may exercise their warrants or stock options to purchase shares of our common stock 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect  if any  that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued in connection with the exercise of the warrants or stock options  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
shares eligible for public sale in the future could decrease the price of our common stock and reduce our future ability to raise capital 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could decrease the prevailing market price of our common stock  which would have an adverse affect on our ability to raise equity capital in the future 
we do not intend to pay dividends and are precluded from doing so while our svb and pfg loan agreements are outstanding 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we are currently precluded from doing so while the svb and pfg loan agreements are outstanding 
even in the event the svb and pfg loan agreements are terminated  we currently intend to retain future earnings  if any  to finance operations and expand our business and  therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  which could decrease the value of our stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting and conversion rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party 
further  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  including not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals 
these and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our amended and restated bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts  reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
application of critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make certain judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
we use historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts could be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory cost adjustments  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  warranty costs  taxes and contingencies 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and or as areas most dependent on management judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is derived principally from the sales of our products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  usually in the form of a purchase order  when shipment has occurred since title and risk of loss passes at that time  or when services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in terms of both credit worthiness of the customer and there are no post shipment obligations or uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
we sell certain of our products to customers with a product warranty that provides warranty repairs at no cost 
the length of the warranty term is one year from date of shipment 
we accrue the estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical claim costs 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or as other information becomes available 
we do not provide price protection or a general right of return 
our return policy only permits product returns for warranty and non warranty repair or replacement and requires pre authorization by us prior to the return 
credit or discounts  which have been historically insignificant  may be given at our discretion and are recorded when and if determined 
we predominantly sell directly to original equipment manufacturers with a direct sales force with limited sales through representatives  var s and distributors 
distributor and var sales represented approximately of total revenue for the year ended march  significant terms and conditions of distributor agreements include fob source  net days payment terms  with no return and limited exchange rights  and no price protection 
since the product transfers title to the distributor at the time of shipment by us  the products are not considered inventory on consignment 
revenue is also derived from technology research and development contracts 
we recognize revenue from these contracts as services and or materials are provided 
impairment of long lived assets as of march  and march   our consolidated balance sheets included million in goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over amounts assigned to tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our business acquisitions 
goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
during the year ended march   we adopted new fasb guidance relative to goodwill impairment whereby in our annual assessment of goodwill impairment  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying valued before performing the two step impairment test 
if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is not necessary 
step one of the two step impairment test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have selected march as the date for our annual impairment test 
we continue to meet the criteria of operating in a single reportable segment and having a single reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our single reporting unit to be equal to our market capitalization plus a control premium 
market capitalization is determined by multiplying the shares outstanding on the assessment date by the average market price of our class a common stock over a day period before and a day period after each assessment date 
we use this day duration to remove inherent market fluctuations that may affect any individual closing price 
we believe that the market capitalization alone does not fully capture the fair value of our business as a whole  or the substantial value that an acquirer would obtain from its ability to obtain control of our business 
as such  in determining fair value  we add a control premium  which seeks to give effect to the increased consideration a potential acquirer would be required to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies  direct operations and make decisions 
our valuation as of march  indicated there were no impairments of goodwill as our market capitalization  as computed as described above was  even without a control premium added  in excess of the carrying value including goodwill of million 
as evidenced above  our stock price and control premium are significant factors in assessing our fair value for purposes of the goodwill impairment assessment 
the stock price can be affected by  among other things  changes in industry or market conditions  changes in our results of operations  and changes in our forecasts or market expectations relating to future results 
the stock price has fluctuated from a high of to a low of on an intra day basis during fiscal the current macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and we cannot be certain of the duration of these conditions and their potential impact on our stock price performance 
if our market capitalization falls below the current carrying value for a sustained period  it is reasonably likely that an intangible and goodwill impairment assessment would be necessary and a non cash charge to operating income may be recorded 
the carrying value of other long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  leasehold improvements  and equipment  are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred relative to a given asset or assets 
impairment is deemed to have occurred if projected undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset asset group are less than the carrying value of the asset asset group 
the estimated cash flows include management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset  or group of assets used in conjunction with the specific asset or assets  in operations 
the amount of the impairment loss recognized is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset  or asset group  over its then estimated fair value 
as a result of the current year operating loss  the company performed an impairment evaluation 
the picometrix acquisition in accounts for a vast majority of the amortizing intangibles  leasehold improvements and equipment subject to the impairment test 
given the shared nature of the manufacturing process for the photodiodes  which are essential for all products sold out of picometrix  we have determined the lowest level of cash flows to be the picometrix subsidiary 
the impairment analysis involved forecasting future undiscounted cash flows of the picometrix group of assets over the estimated useful life of the primary asset of the group 
after performing this first step analysis  we concluded that as of march  there were no impairments indicated based upon the expected overall growth in the g market and our restored ability to service this growth given the resolution of supply chain constraints 
further  our terahertz products have been cost reduced to a point where they have become a competive green alternative to the nuclear gauges used to control certain continuous manufacturing processes 
we believe that we are nearing a point of significant growth in the adoption of this disruptive technology which further increases the expected future cash flows of the group 
accounting for income taxes income tax provisions and benefits are made for taxes currently payable or refundable  and for deferred income taxes arising from future tax consequences of events that were recognized in the our financial statements or tax returns and tax credit carryforwards 
the effects of income taxes are measured based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in accordance with fasb guidance pertaining to accounting for income taxes 
as part our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent operating results and our forecasting process 
we forecast taxable income through our budgeting and planning process each year 
the process takes into account existing contracts  firm sales backlog  and projected sales based upon customer supplied forecasts of product purchases  resources needed to fulfill these customers requirements  and extraordinary expenses that may be part of long term initiatives to increase shareholder value through revenue growth and efficiency improvements leading to profit improvement 
we have substantial history  more than years in most cases  with our customers and markets on which our forecasts are based 
at march   we had net operating loss carry forwards nol s of approximately million for federal income tax purposes and million for state income tax purposes that expire at various dates through fiscal year the tax laws related to the utilization of loss carry forwards are complex and the amount of the our loss carry forward that will ultimately be available to offset future taxable income may be subject to annual limitations under internal revenue code section resulting from changes in the ownership of our common stock 
we performed an analysis to determine whether an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code had occurred 
the effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of the net operating loss carry forwards attributable to periods before the change 
as of march   we believe there are no limitations on the use of these federal nols 
at march   our net deferred tax asset before consideration of a valuation allowance was approximately million  mainly consisting of net operating loss carry forwards which expire at various amounts over an approximate year period 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we have determined that at this time it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized  primarily due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards before they expire based on the negative evidence of our recent years history of losses over the past three years  outweighing the positive evidence of income projections in future years 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or within the periods before nol carry forwards expire 
as of both march  and  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the calculation of federal income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step involves evaluating the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step involves estimating and measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
our evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we have taken no tax positions which would require disclosure 
inventories inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost on a first in first out basis or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are reviewed throughout the year to assess whether a cost adjustment is required 
our review of slow moving and obsolete inventory begins with a listing of all inventory items which have not moved regularly within the past months 
in addition  any residual inventory  which is customer specific and remaining on hand at the time of contract completion  is included in the list 
the complete list of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reviewed by the production  engineering and or purchasing departments to identify items that can be utilized in the near future 
these items are then excluded from the analysis and the remaining amount of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then further assessed and a write down is recorded when warranted 
additionally  non cancelable open purchase orders for parts we are obligated to purchase where demand has been reduced may also be written down 
impairments for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price are also recorded 
the impairments established for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory create a new cost basis for those items 
the cost basis of these parts is not subsequently increased if the circumstances which led to the impairment change in the future 
if a product that had previously been impaired is subsequently sold  the amount of reduced cost basis is reflected as cost of goods sold 
warrant valuations we have warrants outstanding exercisable into  shares of series a common stock with an estimated value of  as of march  we compute the value of the warrants using the monte carlo model  which is generally a preferred model when instruments contain non standard features 
when a warrant may have different share exercise assumptions such as those issued in february to partners for growth iii  lp and affiliates  we weigh various values based on the estimated probability of each outcome as of the valuation date 
the value derived from the model is therefore sensitive to changes in our weighting and also changes in the inputs regarding the current stock price  the contractual term  volatility  risk free interest rates and expected dividend rate 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march revenues we predominantly operate in one industry segment  light and radiation detection devices  and sell to five major markets including telecommunications  industrial sensing non destructive testing  military and aerospace  medical  and homeland security 
revenues by market consisted of the following year ended march  march  telecommunications industrial sensing ndt military aerospace medical homeland security total revenues our total revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of approximately million  or  from revenues of million for fiscal one of our five market segments showed growth in fiscal relative to fiscal telecommunications sales were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal the decrease in our telecommunications revenues for fiscal was the result of supply chain disruption at a major g customer early in the year  delay in ramping our new cost reduced g product due to supply issues from a component vendor and a slowdown in china infrastructure spend 
our telecommunications revenue in the fourth quarter decreased approximately  from the prior year fourth quarter and decreased approximately  from the third quarter of the current year 
the decline in revenue for the fourth quarter this year relative to last year was primarily due to completion of g network build outs in north america and europe which were completed earlier in our current fiscal year 
we saw a sequential quarterly revenue decline given a slowdown in government related telecom programs 
industrial sensing ndt market revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of  from fiscal revenues of million 
our industrial sensing ndt revenue in the fourth quarter of the current year increased million from the comparable prior year quarter 
these increases are the result of higher terahertz contract and system sales as well as approximately  in revenues from one month of activity with the newly acquired net operating assets of silonex now known as advanced photonix canada or apc 
revenues in this market during the fourth quarter of the current year also increased approximately  or million  from the third quarter of the current year given a rebound in our optosolutions product line business as well as the added revenue from the net operating assets of apc previously mentioned 
military aerospace market revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from the comparable prior year revenues of million  due to timing on certain government development contracts 
our military aerospace market revenue in the fourth quarter of the current year decreased  from the prior year fourth quarter due to timing of orders from our optosolution customers 
our military aerospace market revenues decreased  from the third quarter of the current year 
this decrease was attributable primarily to the contract completion of a major government terahertz development contract 
medical market revenues decreased  or  to  from the prior year revenue of million 
our medical market revenue in the fourth quarter of the current year decreased  from the prior year fourth quarter and were essentially flat with the third quarter of the current year 
these fluctuations are the result of one customer introducing a new product that does not require our photodetector 
homeland security revenues decreased to from prior year revenue of million and the prior year fourth quarter revenue of  given the completion of the in q tel anomaly detection development contract in our fiscal we have completed the development phase of this contract and any future revenues will be dependent on placement of our product on the us government qualified products list 
in looking out to next year  we believe telecom revenues in fiscal year will be up significantly as supply constraints are now resolved 
we expect growth in the industrial ndt market in fiscal year driven by an improving industrial business landscape as well as a full year of revenues from the apc business 
the military aerospace market is expected to be flat to down primarily due to the completion of some major terahertz development contracts  the wind down of worldwide conflicts and federal deficit reduction efforts curtailing defense spending 
we expect medical market revenues to be flat in fiscal year our guidance does not include any meaningful homeland security revenue for fiscal year overall  we expect fiscal year to exceed growth given the resolution of telecom supplier component constraints  the full year results of the silonex net operating asset purchase and an improving industrial business climate 
gross profit gross profit was million or of revenue  compared to the prior year of million of revenue  a decrease of million 
the lower gross profit rate and dollars were due primarily to the lower volume of hsor and optosolutions products sold during the year 
gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million of revenue versus million of revenue during the prior year fourth quarter due to cost reduction efforts to improve margins 
gross profit was million of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal and declined by approximately  as expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal  predominantly due to product mix as hsor government sales trailed off and were replaced by industrial optosolutions product sales 
operating expenses research and development expenses r d our r d expenses decreased approximately  or  over the prior year 
r d expenses of million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal were and of sales  respectively 
in fiscal  we increased headcount to develop and qualify certain g hsor products  and accelerate thz application and market development 
qualification costs were consequently down significantly in fiscal and we reduced compensation costs by to bring our spending more in line with our revenue profile 
sales and marketing expenses s m s m expenses decreased  or to million of sales in fiscal compared to million of sales in fiscal the decreased spending was due to the reduction in trade show expenses and lower commissions on lower revenues 
general and administrative expenses g a g a expenses decreased  to approximately million of sales for fiscal  as compared to million of sales for fiscal the decrease was attributable to reduced stock compensation as our board of directors waived a portion of their annual grant and other grants were minimal for the year given business conditions 
amortization expense decreased approximately  to million compared to the prior year of approximately million 
we use the cash flow amortization method on the majority of our intangible assets which results in a declining expense profile over the life of the assets 
financing and other income expense  net interest income for fiscal was approximately  compared to  for fiscal interest expense for fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  due to higher rates on our term loan with svb  amortization of debt issuance costs related to the svb and pfg loans  amortization of the debt discount on the pfg loan and the million in debt issued to partners for growth iii  l 
p pfg in february to assist in financing the silonex business net operating asset purchase as well as provide additional liquidity 
for the year ended march   there was a reduction in the fair value of the warrant liability that triggered other income of  which compared to other income of  for the year ended march  fasb guidance requires our outstanding warrants to be recorded as a liability at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the warrant is determined using a monte carlo option pricing model  and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
when a warrant may have different share exercise assumptions such as those issued in february to pfg and affiliates  we weigh various values based on the estimated probability of each outcome as of the valuation date 
the income of  related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability for fiscal is primarily due to the decrease in our stock price and declining contractual life 
net loss for fiscal was million per share  as compared to net loss of million per share in fiscal  an increase in the loss of approximately million 
the increase in losses for the year were primarily attributable to the lower gross margin realized of million   less income on the change in fair value of warrants  offset by million in operating expense reductions 
liquidity and capital resources at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  a decrease of million from million as of march  as cash has been used to fund losses  acquire the silonex now known as advanced photonix canada or apc business  and pay down certain debt obligations 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million  cash used in investing activities was million and cash provided from financing activities netted million 
operating activities net cash used in operations for the year ended march  was million  the result of a net loss of million net of non cash expenses of million and net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of  revenue levels in this year s fourth quarter were lower than the prior year thereby allowing for a liquidation of a small amount of working capital into cash 
net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended march  was the result of net cash provided by operations of  and by net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of  the net cash provided by operations included a net loss of million and non cash income of  for the change in the fair value of warrants  offset by non cash expenses of million from depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense 
the net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of  primarily resulted from a reduction in inventory offset by decreases in accounts payable as our production levels in fiscal were lower than the end of fiscal investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended march   consisting of capital expenditures of  patent expenditures of  and  spent by our newly formed canadian subsidiary  advanced photonix canada  inc to acquire the net operating assets of silonex in march net cash used by investing activities was  for the year ended march   consisting of capital expenditures of  and patent expenditures of  offset by the elimination of restricted cash of  required under the privatebank loan agreement 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended march  in february  we entered into a month amortizing note with pfg in exchange for million 
during fiscal  we made scheduled principal payments of  on our debt with svb  pfg and medc msf and paid down  on our line of credit with svb 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended march  the amount consisted of a net increase in bank debt of  offset by the payoff of related party debt of approximately million  and the reduction in medc msf debt of  debt bank debt on september   we executed a loan agreement the privatebank loan agreement with the privatebank and trust company privatebank 
the initial privatebank loan agreement provided us with a term loan and a million line of credit 
on september   we entered into a fifth amendment to the privatebank loan agreement the fifth amendment which established a new million term loan and extended the existing million line of credit 
the term loan was to be repaid in monthly principal payments of  plus interest at prime plus  until maturity on october  the line of credit incurred interest at prime plus and any outstanding borrowings were due on september  the availability under the line of credit was determined by a calculation of a borrowing base that includes a percentage of accounts receivable and inventory 
the line of credit was guaranteed by each of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the term loan was secured by a security agreement among api  our subsidiaries and privatebank  pursuant to which privatebank received a first priority security interest in certain described assets 
the privatebank loan agreement contained financial covenants including minimum debt service coverage ratio  adjusted ebitda level  and net worth requirements  each as defined in the loan agreement 
on january   we entered into a loan and security agreement and such other documents which constitute the svb loan agreement with silicon valley bank svb and terminated the privatebank loan agreement by paying off the outstanding balances 
subsequent to the initial svb loan agreement  there have been three amendments that have modified the covenants  allowed for the acquisition of substantially all of the operating assets of silonex as described in note to the consolidated financial statements and allowed for the grant to partners for growth iii  lp pfg of a subordinated security interest in the company s collateral 
the terms of the svb loan agreement as amended provide for a million line of credit with a million export import ex im sublimit at an interest rate that ranges from prime plus basis points on up to prime plus basis points depending on a liquidity ratio and adjusted three month rolling ebitda as defined in the svb loan agreement 
the svb loan agreement as amended contains a covenant for a minimum rolling three month adjusted ebitda  measured monthly  and a minimum liquidity ratio of to 
the current adjusted ebitda covenant allows for a negative adjusted ebitda of  for each month during the period from january to june  negative adjusted ebitda of  for each month during the period july through october  adjusted ebitda of for each month during the period november through february  and adjusted ebitda of  thereafter  subject to reset based on mutual agreement once a fiscal year budget is submitted to the lenders 
we are restricted under the pfg loan agreement from borrowing more than million on the svb line of credit for the first six months of the pfg loan 
the amount that can be drawn on the line of credit is subject to a formula based on our outstanding receivables and inventory 
in addition  the initial svb loan agreement provided for a million term loan with principal payable over three years in equal monthly installments and interest at a rate ranging from prime plus basis points to prime plus basis points dependent on our liquidity ratio and adjusted three month rolling ebitda as defined in the svb loan agreement 
under the svb loan agreement  we may prepay all  but not less than all  of the term loan by paying a prepayment premium equal to i of the amount outstanding if prepayment occurs before the first anniversary of the term loan  ii of the amount outstanding if prepayment occurs after the first  but before the second anniversary of the term loan  and iii of the amount outstanding if prepayment occurs after the second anniversary of the term loan 
in addition  if the term loan becomes due and payable because of the occurrence and continuance of an event of default as defined in the svb loan agreement  we will be required to pay a termination fee equal to of the amount outstanding 
the interest rates on the svb term loan and line of credit as of march  were and  respectively 
we had nothing outstanding on the svb line of credit with approximately million in borrowing capacity as of march  however  given the pfg covenants  we are restricted from borrowing more than million on the svb line through august  the ex im line of credit with svb is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries and all borrowings under the svb loan agreement are secured by a first priority security interest granted to svb over substantially all of our respective assets 
as of march   we are and expect to remain in compliance with the related liquidity and adjusted ebitda covenant with svb 
the svb term loan expires in march and the line of credit expires in january  but can be extended each anniversary date by mutual consent 
total interest payments made to our bank lenders during the years ended march  and march  were approximately  and  respectively 
partners for growth secured debt on february   we entered into a secured debt agreement with pfg that is subordinated to svb s senior secured position the pfg loan agreement 
in conjunction with this transaction  we executed a second amendment to the svb loan to allow pfg a subordinated position and to adjust the previous covenant levels 
on february   pursuant to the terms of the pfg loan agreement  we received million in cash and were obligated to make monthly principal and interest payments beginning in march for months at an initial interest rate of 
the interest rate may be reduced to based on the achievement of certain revenue and adjusted ebitda metrics in future periods 
consistent with a second amendment to the svb loan agreement  the pfg loan agreement provided for a minimum rolling three month adjusted ebitda covenant  measured monthly  on a go forward basis and a minimum liquidity ratio of to 
the new adjusted ebitda covenant begins at a negative adjusted ebitda of  for each month during the period february to june  negative adjusted ebitda of  for each month during the period july through october  adjusted ebitda of for each month during the period november through february  and adjusted ebitda of  thereafter  subject to reset based on mutual agreement once a fiscal year budget is submitted to the lenders 
we are restricted under the agreement from borrowing more than million on the svb line of credit for the first six months of the pfg loan agreement 
as part of the consideration for the loan  we granted pfg and certain of its affiliates warrants to purchase up to  shares of class a common stock with  of the shares issuable at per share  and the remaining  shares issuable at a strike price 
in the event that we achieve at least  in sales and  in ebitda during the fiscal year ending march   the warrant agreements the pfg warrant agreements provide that an aggregate of  of the warrants and an aggregate of  of the warrants will be cancelled 
the pfg warrant agreements also include a net exercise provision pursuant to which the warrant holders would receive the number of shares equal to i the product of a the number of warrants exercised multiplied by b the difference between the fair market value of a share of class a common stock with fair value generally being equal to the highest closing price of our class a common stock during the consecutive trading days prior to the date of exercise and the strike price of the warrant  ii divided by the fair market value of a share of class a common stock 
in addition  in the event we are acquired  liquidate  conduct a public offering  or the warrants expire  each warrant holder will have the right to put its warrants to the company in exchange for a per share cash payment that varies with the number of shares issuable under each warrant  but in the aggregate will not exceed  we determined the fair value of the warrant as of the issuance date to be  pursuant to the accounting literature  a debt discount and a warrant liability were established as of the issuance date with the debt discount amortized over the life of the loan on an effective interest method 
as of march   there was  in remaining unamortized debt discount offset against the pfg long term debt principal 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the pfg warrants 
total interest payments made to pfg during the years ended march  and march  were approximately  and  respectively 
we were in compliance with our loan covenants as of march  medc msf loans the michigan economic development corporation medc entered into two loan agreements with our subsidiary  picometrix  one in fiscal medc loan and one in fiscal medc loan for a total initial principal amount of million 
both loans are unsecured 
under the amended terms of the medc loan  we are to make monthly principal and interest payments of  through maturity in december the interest rate on medc loan was at march  under the amended terms of the medc loan  which was assigned to the michigan strategic fund msf in june  we are to make monthly principal and interest payments of  through maturity in october the interest rate on the msf loan was at march  interest payments made to the medc msf were approximately  and  during the years ended march  and march   respectively 
liquidity outlook combined with the newly agreed covenants with both svb and pfg  expected cash flow from operations  and the current svb line of credit  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient for the next twelve months 
positive cash flow from operations is highly dependent on increasing revenue levels 
we have had and may continue to experience supply limitations that could hamper our ability to achieve the levels of hsor revenue and the related gross margin previously enjoyed 
we may therefore need additional financing to fund our operations in the future and there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available  especially if we experience operating results below expectations  or  if financing is available  there can be no assurance as to the terms on which funds might be available 
if adequate financing is not available as required  or is not available on favorable terms  our business  financial position and results of operations will be adversely affected

we enter into agreements with suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon agreements defining our material and services requirements 
although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or the performance of services 
off balance sheet arrangements at march  and march   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements there have been no recent accounting pronouncements expected to significantly impact our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at march   most of our interest rate exposure is linked to the prime rate  subject to certain limitations  offset by interest that may be earned on our cash balances 
as such  we are at risk to the extent of changes in the prime rate that are not reflected in money market rates 
we do not believe that moderate changes in the prime rate will materially affect our operating results or financial condition
