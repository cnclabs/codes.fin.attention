summary of the fiscal year ended december  the economic and pharmaceutical challenges and uncertainties had negatively impacted our business in  which led to the overall decline in sales of our products 
for the year ended december   we had a certain drop in financial performance 
revenue decreased by to million  as compared to million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily from our cns cerebral cardio vascular product category in terms of the decrease in dollar amount approximately million and digestive disease product category in terms of percentage of decrease in revenues approximately net income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  from million in the year ended december  our net income for the year ended december  included inventory obsolescence  while the net income for the year ended december  included gains resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative warrant liability 
due to the negative impact on sales of finished goods from price cutting  rising cost and policy adjustment  significant differences occurred between the sales estimates when raw materials were purchased compared to the sales performance realized for certain products 
this lead to certain raw materials approached their expiration dates 
based on the evaluation the management made on december   we recognized a reserve of million for inventory obsolescence 
without the effect of the inventory obsolescence and derivative warrant liability  management estimates that net income would have been approximately million and million in and the decrease in net income was mainly due to the decrease in revenue  gross profit margin  and the incurrence of inventory obsolescence in from a profitability perspective  our gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to in without the effect of inventory obsolescence in  management estimates that our gross profit would have been approximately in the decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increases in costs and margin compression as a result of the healthcare reform 
pricing pressure is now quite a prominent feature in the overall pharmaceutical market in china 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the decrease is due primarily to the decrease in net income  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
earnings per common share basic and diluted for the year ended december  was per share compared to per share for the year ended december  business overview recent developments in the year ended december   we continued to execute our business strategy of expanding revenues from our core portfolio of products while continuing the development process of new products 
however the year was a challenging one as the implementation of the healthcare reform has resulted in increased pricing pressure and lower gross profit margins across the board for almost all pharmaceutical products 
the products in our pipe line progressed slowly but steadily along the development process  and are getting closer to product launch 
the sfda is also revising its production approval criteria and processes  resulting in longer approval time for new production applications across all types of products 
in some cases they are adding additional requirements for products already under review 
in november   we received production approval from the sfda for candesartan  a front line drug therapy we developed for the treatment of hypertension 
we plan to launch this product during the clinical trial for rosuvastatin  or the generic version of crestor  was completed in december  and we are in the process of applying for the production approval for this product 
in september  we also completed phase i of our clinical trial for our new antibiotic combination drug 
we are currently moving ahead and are in phase ii of the trial for this drug 
the following is a list of the current status of some of our pipeline products cadesartan 
we received production approval from the sfda for candesartan  a front line drug therapy we developed for the treatment of hypertension in november we plan to launch this product during antibiotic combination 
we completed the phase i clinical trials of our novel cephalosporin based combination antibiotic in the third quarter of we are currently in phase ii of the clinical trial which is progressing well 
rosuvastatin 
rosuvastatin is a generic form of crestor  a drug for indication of high blood cholesterol level 
clinical trials for this generic drug were completed in the fourth quarter of and we have submitted an application for production approval 
heart disease drug 
we are developing a liquid oral medicine for the treatment of coronary heart disease 
this product comes with a patented traditional chinese medicine tcm formula and we are currently conducting phase iii clinical trials for this drug 
due to the improved regulatory requests for clinical works  we adjusted our anticipated completion timeframe for the clinical trials work for this product to market trends the growth of china s pharmaceutical market is driven by china s rapid economic growth 
increased healthcare spending by the chinese government to reform the healthcare system has already greatly improved the accessibility of  and desire for  medical care 
important additional factors include  but are not limited to the aging of the population and the resulting increase in age related disorders  the urban migration of the population  and improved awareness of personal health care 
the healthcare reform program announced by the chinese government in late is having a significant impact on all healthcare related industries in china  including the pharmaceutical industry 
over all  the government plans to provide a basic  universal healthcare system to all citizens of china 
we believe volume expansion will continue as government subsidies to rural communities expand further 
while pricing is generally set at the central government level  provincial government intervention has added complexity to the pricing volume interaction 
in addition to edl products  we have also seen pricing pressure on most of the drugs we sell 
while these changes have more impact on pharmaceutical distribution companies  manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are also affected 
we believe the general implication is that gross margins for pharmaceutical products will continue to be under pressure for some time 
that being said  a pharmaceutical manufacturer with experienced management and the ability to react quickly to changes will not only survive but thrive in this environment 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  revenue for the year ended december   our sales revenue was million  a decrease of  compared to million in set forth below are our revenues by product category in millions usd for the years ended december  and product category fiscal years ended december net change change cns cerebral cardio vascular anti viro infection respiratory digestive diseases other the most significant revenue decrease in terms of dollar amount was in our cns cerebral cardio vascular product category  which generated million in sales revenue compared to million a year ago  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was mainly due to sales of bumetanide  a drug prescribed for treatments of various edema diseases  hypertension  acute renal failure  and ozagrel  also a drug prescribed for treatments of cerebral thrombosis  coronary heart disease 
sales of the anti viro infection respiratory category decreased by million to million in compared to million in  which was mainly due to the decrease in sales of our cefalexin capsules  an edl drug 
our digestive diseases category generated million of sales in  compared to million in the previous year  or a decrease of million 
our other product category sales fell to million from million  a decrease of million 
in the year ended december   revenue breakdown by product category showed small changes 
sales of the anti viro respiratory products category represented of total sales in the year ended on december   compared to in the cns  cerebral cardio vascular category was steady  representing of total revenue in and the digestive diseases category represented of total revenue in compared to in the other category represented and of revenues in and  respectively 
cost of revenue for the year ended december   our cost of revenue was million  or of total revenue  which represented a decrease of million from million  or of total revenue  in  a decrease of 
the decrease in cost of revenue during was not proportional to the revenue decrease  primarily due to increases in our average unit costs for inventory 
gross profit and gross margin gross profit for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in our gross profit margin in was  compared to in without the effect of inventory obsolescence in  management estimates that our gross profit would have been approximately in the healthcare reform instituted by the chinese government since has resulted in margin compression in most pharmaceutical products on the markets today  especially in the generic space that many of our products are in 
the decrease of sales and continuously increase of the purchase price of raw materials attributed to the decrease of gross profit 
going forward we expect to see continued pricing pressure on most products  but new products such as candesartan and rosuvastatin could help to support overall gross margin once they are launched 
selling expenses our selling expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of approximately million  compared to million in selling expenses accounted for of the total revenue in compared to in due to many adjustments in our selling processes from healthcare reform policies  despite the decrease in sales  we required additional personnel and expenses to support the sales and collection of accounts receivable 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from million in general and administrative expenses accounting for and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
bad debt expenses benefit in general  our normal credit or payment terms extended to customers are days 
this has not changed in recent years 
due to the peculiarity of the chinese pharmaceutical market environment  deferred payments to pharmaceutical companies by state owned hospitals and local medicine distributors are a normal phenomenon 
our customers are primarily pharmaceutical distributors who sell to mostly government backed hospitals 
therefore the age of our receivables from our customers tends to be long 
although these customers typically pay after the due date of the receivables  since the majority of hospitals in china are backed by the government  management believes that the deferred payments from state owned hospitals are secure and will eventually be collected 
so far  we have always been able to collect our receivables and have not written off any receivables in our year history of doing business with hospitals 
the amount of accounts receivable that were past due or the amount of accounts receivable that were more than days old was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the following table illustrates our accounts receivable aging distribution in terms of percentage of total accounts receivable as of december  and december  december  days days days days total although we have not had to write off any receivables thus far in our history  we do set aside an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our bad debt allowance estimate is currently the sum of of accounts receivable that are less than days old  of accounts receivable that are between days and days old and of accounts receivable that are greater than days old although there were no accounts receivable over days old at december  or 
to the extent that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is higher than that of the previous period  we recognize a bad debt expense for the difference during the current period  and when the current allowance is lower than that of the previous period  we recognize a bad debt benefit for the difference 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and december  respectively 
the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended december  and were as follows there were no write offs or recoveries for the fiscal years ended december  balance  beginning of year bad debt expense benefit foreign currency translation adjustment balance  end of year impairment of intangible assets the carrying values of long lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
as a result of the evaluations made in december   the company determined that it is not likely that the carrying value of two medical formulas will be realized from future cash flows due to the failure to meet certain improved technical criteria for one formula and pricing pressures on the other one 
as a result  impairment losses relating to those intangible assets were  during the year ended december  no impairment losses were recognized during the year ended december  income from operations our operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the main reasons for the decrease were lower revenue  lower gross profits and higher bad debt expenses in net interest income expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  in  an increase of  derivative gains losses changes to derivative warrant liability are recognized in the results of operations and resulted in a derivative gain of  during the year ended december  please see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
there was no derivative gain during the year ended december  income tax expense in the years ended december  and  we paid income tax at the rate of 
income tax expense was million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
we obtained the national high tech enterprise status national ht status from the prc government in the fourth quarter of with this designation  we are entitled to a preferential tax rate of for the years ending december   and  which is notably lower than the statutory income tax rate of 
net income net income for year ended december  was million  a decrease of  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in net income was mainly due to the decrease in revenue  gross profit margin  increase in cost  and changes in derivative gain 
for the year ended december   earnings per basic and diluted common share was per share  compared to per share in the year ended december  the number of basic and diluted weighted average outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share were  for and  for liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and short term bank loans 
our cash and cash equivalents was million  which represents of our total assets as of december   was comparable to million  which represents of our total assets as of december  of the million of cash and cash equivalents at december   a total of million is considered to be reinvested indefinitely in helpson and is not expected to be available for payment of dividends  for other payments to our parent company or to its shareholders 
as of december   we had a principal balance of million in short term bank loans 
the cash flow generated from operating activities funded the new purchases of our intangible assets drug formulas 
during  we continued our vigorous collection efforts from our customers and achieved good results 
while we have made progress  improving our accounts receivable collection continues to be a focus of our management team and we expect to make further progress in the quarters to come 
at december   the company was obligated to pay laboratories million upon their completion of the various phases of contracts to provide sfda production approval of more than medical formulas 
those payments are expected to be made out of the company s cash flow from operations ratably over approximately the following months  depending on the progress of the various contracts 
a typical contract requires an upfront deposit and then two to three additional milestone payments plus a final payment when the sfda approval is obtained 
since the payments are progress driven  it is difficult to calculate the timing of the payments with any precision  however  management expects that the payments will be somewhat even over the payment period given the number of contracts in progress 
the funding obligation is not expected to have an undue negative impact on the liquidity of the company given the company s historical cash flows and estimated future cash flows from operating activities 
based on our current operating plan  management believes that our cash provided by operations as well as the anticipated capital expenditure project financing from a bank will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and our anticipated capital expenditures  including expenditures for new formula acquisitions and new gmp upgrading related construction and equipment  for the next twelve months 
however  if events or circumstances occur and we do not meet our operating plan as expected  we may be required to seek additional capital and or to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we may seek additional financing as necessary for expansion purposes and when we believe market conditions are most advantageous  which may include debt and or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in the twelve months period ended december  compared to million for the same period in as a common business practice in china  banker acceptances bas are often used to settle payment instead of checks 
during the year ended december   the company collected accounts receivable with bas with a maturity of more than days  and such bas are not treated as cash and cash equivalent under us gaap 
if cash equivalent treatment were to be applied to bas with more than days maturity  million would have been generated in operating activities in the year ended december  this was mainly because of the improved performance in collection of accounts receivable partially offset the decrease in net income in at december   our accounts receivable was million  a decrease of million from million at december  our receivables decreased due to decreased sales and the improved performance of our collection in account receivables 
for fiscal  million was generated from decreases in account receivables  compared to million was used to fund increases in accounts receivable in the comparable period a year ago 
at december   total inventory was million  an increase of million from million at december  in order to avoid any negative impact from our transition to our new production facility  new gmp upgrading and construction  we have gradually increased our inventory to a relatively high level 
cash used on inventories for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the comparable period for for the period ending december   the decrease in our accounts payable was responsible for a cash usage of million in  compared to a cash usage of million in the same period in investing activities in the year ended december   net cash used in investment activities was million  a decrease of million  compared to million in as a common business practice in china  banker acceptances bas are often used to settle payment instead of checks 
during the year ended december   the company made payment with bas with a maturity of more than days  and such bas are not treated as cash and cash equivalent under us gaap 
if cash equivalent treatment were to be applied to bas with more than days maturity  million would have been used in investment activities 
the investment spending in was mainly for the new gmp upgrading related construction and equipment  as well as purchase of medical formulas 
financing activities in the year ended december   net cash flow generated from financing activities was approximately million compared to million in the same period of the main source of the financing came from the increased size of the new credit line we got from a bank  as well as the loan from a related party 
according to relevant prc laws  companies registered in the prc  including our prc subsidiary  helpson  are required to allocate at least ten percent of their after tax net income  as determined under accounting standards and regulations in the prc  to statutory surplus reserve accounts until the reserve account balances reach fifty percent of the companies registered capital prior to their remittance of funds out of the prc 
allocations to these reserves and funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferrable to the parent company in the form of loans  advances or cash dividends 
as of december  and  the net assets of helpson were  and  respectively 
due to the restriction on dividend distribution to overseas shareholders  the amount of helpson s net assets that were designated for general and statutory capital reserves  and thus could not be transferred to our parent company as cash dividends  were  and  of registered capital for the fiscal years ended december  and since the amount that helpson must set aside for the statutory surplus fund only accounts for and  respectively  of its total net assets  this reserve does not have a major impact on our liquidity 
the prc government also imposes controls on the conversion of rmb into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the prc 
our businesses and assets are primarily denominated in rmb 
all foreign exchange transactions take place either through the people s bank of china or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the people s bank of china 
approval of foreign currency payments by the people s bank of china or other regulatory institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with applicable invoices and signed contracts 
these currency exchange control procedures imposed by the prc government authorities may restrict the ability of helpson  our prc subsidiary  to transfer its net assets to our parent company through loans  advances or cash dividends 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments at december   we were obligated to pay laboratories and others approximately  over approximately the next years upon completion of the various phases of contracts to provide sfda production approval of medical formulas 
we entered into purchase and construction agreements during the year ended december  in connection with the construction of a new facility and required manufacturing improvements 
future minimum commitments under the agreements are as follows for the year ended december  total critical accounting policies management discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles
