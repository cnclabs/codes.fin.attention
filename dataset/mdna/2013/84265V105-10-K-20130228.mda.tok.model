competitive conditions competition in the copper market is primarily on a price and service basis  with price being the most important consideration when supplies of copper are ample 
our products compete with other materials  including aluminum and plastics 
for additional information  see item a risk factors the copper mining industry is highly competitive 
employees as of december   we had  employees  approximately of whom are covered by labor agreements with eleven different labor unions 
during the last several years  we have experienced strikes or other labor disruptions that have had an adverse impact on our operations and operating results 
our taxco and san martin mines in mexico have been on strike since july  our buenavista mine was on strike from july through june  peru approximately of our  peruvian employees were unionized at december   represented by eight separate unions 
three of these unions  one at each major production area  represent  workers 
also  there are five smaller unions  representing the balance of workers 
we conducted negotiations with the eight unions whose collective bargaining agreements expired in during the first two months of  we have signed three year agreements with all the unions 
the agreements include  among other things  annual salary increases of  and for each of the three years  respectively  for all workers 
there were no strikes during and on december and  the three major unions held a two day illegal work stoppage which did not have a material impact on production 

table of contents employees of the toquepala and cuajone units reside in townsites  where we have built  houses and apartments 
we also have houses at ilo for staff personnel 
housing  together with maintenance and utility services  is provided at minimal cost to most of our employees 
our townsite and housing complexes include schools  medical facilities  churches  social clubs and recreational facilities 
we also provide shopping  banking and other services at the townsites 
mexico approximately of our  mexican workers were unionized at december   represented by three separate unions 
under mexican law  the terms of employment for unionized workers is set forth in collective bargaining agreements 
mexican companies negotiate the salary provisions of collective bargaining agreements with the labor unions annually and negotiate other benefits every two years 
we conduct negotiations separately at each mining complex and each processing plant 
in recent years  the mexican operations have experienced a positive improvement of their labor environment  as our workers  in a free decision  opted to change their affiliation from the sindicato nacional de trabajadores mineros  metal rgicos y similares de la republica mexicana national union of mine and metal workers and similar activities of the mexican republic or the national mining union to other unions 
in  workers of our mexicana del cobre mining complex and immsa joined the sindicato nacional de trabajadores de la exploraci n  explotaci n y beneficio de minas en la republica mexicana  national union of workers engaged in exploration  exploitation and processing of mines in the mexican republic  and the mexicana del cobre metallurgical workers joined the sindicato de trabajadores de la industria minero metalurgica union of workers of the mine and metals industry or the ctm 
finally  in our buenavista del cobre workers joined the ctm 
this positive labor environment allows us to increase our productivity and to develop our capital expansion programs 
the workers of the san martin and taxco mines  still under the national mining union  have been on strike since july on december   a federal court confirmed the legality of the san martin strike 
in order to recover the control of the san martin mine and resume operations  on january   we filed a court petition requesting that the court  among other things define the termination payment for each unionized worker 
the court denied the petition alleging that  according to federal labor law  the union was the only legitimate party to file such petition 
on appeal by us  on may   the mexican federal tribunal accepted the petition 
in july  the national mining union appealed the favorable court decision before the supreme court 
on november   the supreme court affirmed the decision of the federal tribunal 
we filed a new proceeding before the labor court on the basis of the supreme court decision  which recognized the right of the labor court to define responsibility for the strike and the termination payment for each unionized worker 
a favorable decision of the labor court in this new proceeding would have the effect of terminating the protracted strike at san martin 
in july  minera krypton  a mexican mining company  not affiliated with grupo mexico or the company  hired workers for the rehabilitation of its mining unit at chalchihuites  zacatecas 
most of these workers  which are or were workers of the san martin mine  in order to work for minera krypton joined a new union called  the sindicato de trabajadores de la industria minera y similares de la republica mexicana union of workers of the mine and metals industry and similar activities of the mexican republic or the union of mexican mine and metal workers 
on august   the union of mexican mine and metal workers filed a petition with the labor authorities to replace the existing union at the san martin mine 
on september   the workers affiliated with the union of mexican mine and metal workers took over the san martin mine evicting the workers on strike 
several hearings took place during september with the federal labor authorities 
on october   the federal labor court ordered and enforced a recount in order to establish which union will hold the collective bargaining agreement 
the union of mexican mine and metal workers lost the recount 
the result of the recount was challenged by the union of mexican mine and metal workers and is pending resolution 
in the case of the taxco mine  following the workers refusal to allow exploration of new reserves  we commenced litigation seeking to terminate the labor relationship with workers of the taxco mine including the related collective bargaining agreement 
on september   the federal labor court issued a ruling approving the termination of the collective bargaining agreement and all the individual labor contracts of the workers affiliated with the mexican mining union at the taxco mine 
the ruling was based upon the resistance of the mining union to allow us search for reserves at the taxco mine 
the mining union appealed the labor court ruling before a federal court 
in september  the federal court accepted the union s appeal and requested that the federal labor court review the procedure and take into account all the evidence to issue a 
table of contents new resolution 
on january   the federal labor court issued a new resolution  approving the termination of the collective bargaining agreement and all the individual labor contracts of the workers affiliated with the national mining union at the taxco mine 
on january   the national mining union appealed the resolution before the federal court 
on june   the federal court accepted the union s appeal and requested that the federal labor court issue a new resolution  taking into account all the evidence submitted by the parties 
on august   the federal labor court issued a new decision disapproving the termination of the collective bargaining agreement and the individual labor contracts of the workers affiliated with the national mining union at the taxco mine 
on august   we filed a proceeding seeking relief from the decision before a federal court 
as of december   resolution of the relief proceeding was pending 
it is expected that operations at these mines will remain suspended until these labor issues are resolved 
employees of the la caridad and buenavista units reside in townsites at la caridad and buenavista  where we have built approximately  houses and apartments and houses and apartments  respectively 
most of the employees of the immsa unit reside on the grounds of the mining or processing complexes in which they work and where we have built approximately houses and apartments 
housing  together with maintenance and utility services  is provided at minimal cost to most of our employees 
our townsites and housing complexes include educational and  in some units  medical facilities  churches  social clubs  shopping centers  banking and other services 
through  the buenavista unit at that time cananea provided health care services free of charge to employees and retired unionized employees and their families through its own hospital at the buenavista unit 
in  the company signed an agreement with the secretary of health of the state of sonora to continue providing these services to its retired workers and their families 
the new workers of buenavista del cobre will receive health services from the mexican institute of social security as is the case for all mexican workers 
fuel  electricity and water supplies the principal raw materials used in our operations are fuels  electricity and water 
we use natural gas to power boilers and generators and for metallurgical processes at our mexican operations and diesel fuel for mining equipment 
we believe that supplies of fuel  electricity and water are readily available 
although the prices of these raw materials may fluctuate beyond our control  we focus our efforts to reduce these costs through cost and energy saving measures 
peru in peru  electric power for our operating facilities is generated by two thermal electric plants owned and operated by enersur sa  an independent power company enersur  a diesel and waste heat boilers plant located adjacent to the ilo smelter and a coal plant located south of ilo 
power generation capacity for peruvian operations is currently megawatts 
enersur is building three new power units  with a total capacity of megawatt  close to the current coal plant  which will provide additional power reserves in the south of peru 
enersur has a legal commitment to put in services these three new units no later than september in addition  we have nine megawatts of power generation capacity from two small hydro generating installations at cuajone 
power is distributed over a kilometer closed loop transmission circuit  which is interconnected with the peruvian network 
in  we sold our ilo power plant to enersur 
in connection with the sale  a power purchase agreement was also completed under which we agreed to purchase all of our power needs for our peruvian operations from enersur for twenty years  commencing in in  the agreement was amended releasing enersur from its obligation to construct additional capacity to meet our increased electricity requirements and changing the power tariff as called for in the original agreement 
in  we signed a memorandum of understanding mou with enersur regarding its power supply agreement 
the mou contains new economic terms that we believe better reflect current economic conditions in the power industry and in peru 
the new economic conditions agreed in the mou have been applied by enersur to its invoices to us since may additionally  the mou includes an option for providing power for the tia maria project 
the mou also established a time frame during which enersur and we must negotiate in good faith to settle certain pending issues  including agreeing on a power purchase agreement for the tia maria project 
during and  we continued our negotiation with enersur but negotiations are currently suspended due to the delay of the tia maria project

table of contents in peru  we obtain fuel primarily from a local producer 
we have water rights or licenses for up to  liters per second from well fields at the huaitire  vizcachas and titijones aquifers and also surface water from the suches lake and two small water courses  namely quebrada honda and quebrada tacalaya  which together are sufficient to supply the needs of our two operating units at toquepala and cuajone 
at ilo  we have desalinization plants that produce water for industrial and domestic use that we believe are sufficient for our current and projected needs 
mexico besides electric energy  the principal raw materials used in our operations are fuels 
natural gas is used for metallurgical processes  to power furnaces  converters  casting wheels  boilers and electric generators 
diesel oil is a backup for all these uses 
also at our operations we use diesel oil for mining equipment 
fuel  electricity and water supplies are readily available 
the prices of these materials may fluctuate beyond our control since the only supplier has been the mexican government 
we therefore focus our efforts to reduce these costs through cost and energy saving measures 
mexico generadora de energ a s 
de r 
l  mge  an indirect subsidiary of grupo mexico  is constructing two power plants to supply energy to part of the company s mexican operations 
these plants are natural gas fired combined cycle power generating units  with a net total capacity of megawatts 
it is expected that mge will complete the first plant in and the second in in mexico  fuel is purchased directly from petroleos mexicanos  pemex  the state oil monopoly 
electricity for our mexican operations  which is used as the main energy source at our mining complexes  is purchased from the comision federal de electricidad  the federal electricity commission  or cfe  the state s electrical power producer 
in addition  we recover some energy from waste heat boilers at the la caridad smelter 
accordingly  a significant portion of our operating costs in mexico are dependent upon the pricing policies of pemex and cfe  which reflect government policy  as well as international market prices for crude oil  natural gas and conditions in the refinery markets 
the la caridad unit imports natural gas from the united states through its pipeline between douglas  arizona and nacozari  sonora 
this permits us to import natural gas from the united states at market prices and thereby reduce operating costs 
several contracts with pemex and the united states provide us with the option of using a monthly fixed price or daily fixed prices for our natural gas purchases 
from time to time we enter into gas swap contracts to protect part of our gas consumption 
the gain or losses obtained are included in the production cost 
we have not held any gas swap contract in the past three years  nor do we hold any for energy is the principal cost in mining  therefore the concern for its conservation and efficient usage is very relevant 
we have an energy management committee at most of our mines 
the committees meet periodically to discuss consumptions and to develop measures directed at saving energy 
also  alternative sources are being analyzed at the corporate level  both from traditional and renewable energy sources 
this has helped us develop a culture of energy conservation directed at the sustainability of our operations 
in mexico  water is a national property and industries not connected to a public services water supply must obtain a water concession from comision nacional del agua the national water commission  or cna 
water usage fees are established in the ley federal de derechos the federal law of rights  which distinguishes several availability zones with different fees per unit of volume according to each zone 
all of our operations have one or several water concessions and  with the exception of mexicana de cobre  pump out the required water from one or several wells 
mexicana de cobre pumps water from the la angostura dam  which is close to the mine and plants 
at our buenavista facility  we maintain our own wells and pay the cna for water usage 
water conservation committees have been established in each plant in order to conserve and recycle water 
water usage fees are updated on a yearly basis and have been increasing in recent years

table of contents mining rights and concessions peru we have  hectares in concessions from the peruvian government for our exploration  exploitation  extraction and or production operations  distributed among our various sites as follows toquepala cuajone ilo other total hectares plants operations exploration total we believe that our peruvian concessions are in full force and in effect under applicable peruvian laws and that we are in compliance with all material terms and requirements applicable to these concessions 
the concessions have indefinite terms  subject to our payment of concession fees of up to per hectare annually for the mining concessions and a fee based on nominal capacity for the processing concessions 
fees paid during  and  were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we have two types of mining concessions in peru metallic and non metallic concessions 
we also have water concessions for well fields at huaitire  titijones and vizcachas and surface water rights from the suches lake  which together are sufficient to supply the needs of our toquepala and cuajone operating units 
in  the peruvian congress enacted legislation imposing a royalty charge to be paid by mining companies in favor of the regional governments and communities where mining resources are located 
under this law  we were subject to a to charge  based on sales  and calculated on the value of the concentrates produced at our toquepala and cuajone mines 
we made provisions of million and million in and  respectively  for this charge 
in september  the peruvian congress approved an amendment to the mining royalty charge 
the new mining royalty charge is based on operating income margins with graduated rates ranging from to  with a minimum royalty charge assessed at of net sales 
if the operating income margin is or less  the royalty charge is and for each increment in the operating income margin  the royalty charge rate increases by  up to a maximum of 
in and  we made provisions of million and million  respectively  for this charge 
at the same time the peruvian congress amended the mining royalty charge  it enacted a new tax for the mining industry 
this tax is also based on operating income and its rates range from to 
for additional information see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
mexico in mexico we have approximately  hectares in concessions from the mexican government for our exploration and exploitation activities as outlined in the table below 
immsa la caridad buenavista projects total hectares mine concessions we believe that our mexican concessions are in full force and in effect under applicable mexican laws and that we are in compliance with all material terms and requirements applicable to these concessions 
under mexican law  mineral resources belong to the mexican nation and a concession from the mexican federal government is required to explore or mine mineral reserves 
mining concessions have a year term that can be renewed for another years 
holding fees for mining concessions can be from to per hectare depending on the beginning date of the mining concession 
fees paid during  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  all of our operating units in mexico have water concessions that are in full force and effect 
we generally own the land to which our mexican concessions relate  although ownership is not required in order to explore or mine a concession 
we also own all of the processing facilities of our mexican operations and the land on which they are constructed 

table of contents item a 
risk factors every investor or potential investor in southern copper corporation should carefully consider the following risk factors 
general risks relating to our business our financial performance is highly dependent on the price of copper and the other metals we produce 
our financial performance is significantly affected by the market prices of the metals that we produce  particularly the market prices of copper  molybdenum  zinc and silver 
historically  these prices have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control  including international economic and political conditions  levels of supply and demand  the availability and costs of substitutes  inventory levels maintained by users  actions of participants in the commodities markets and currency exchange rates 
in addition  the market prices of copper and certain other metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short term changes 
the table below provides the sales value of our products as a percentage of our total net sales value 
year ended december  product copper molybdenum silver zinc other by products see also historical average price of our products on item business caption metals prices 
we cannot predict whether metals prices will rise or fall in the future 
future declines in metals prices and  in particular  copper or molybdenum prices  will have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition  and we might  in very adverse market conditions  consider curtailing or modifying certain of our mining and processing operations 
changes in the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our product sales 
our revenue is dependent on the level of industrial and consumer demand for the concentrates and refined and semi refined metal products we sell 
changes in technology  industrial processes and consumer habits may affect the level of that demand to the extent that changes increase or decrease the need for our metal products 
a change in demand  including any change resulting from economic slow downs or recessions  could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
our actual reserves may not conform to our current estimates of our ore deposits and we depend on our ability to replenish ore reserves for our long term viability 
there is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves 
until reserves are actually mined and processed  the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as estimates only 
the proven and probable ore reserves data included in this report are estimates prepared by us based on evaluation methods generally used in the mining industry 
we may be required in the future to revise our reserves estimates based on our actual production 
we cannot assure you that our actual reserves conform to geological  metallurgical or other expectations or that the estimated volume and grade of ore will be recovered 
market prices of our metals  increased production costs  reduced recovery rates  short term operating factors  royalty charges and other factors may render proven and probable reserves uneconomic to exploit and may result in revisions of reserves data from time to time 
reserves data are not indicative of future results of operations 
our reserves are depleted as we mine 
we depend on our ability to replenish our ore reserves for our long term viability 
we use several strategies to replenish and increase our ore reserves  including exploration and investment in properties located near our existing mine sites and investing in technology that could extend the life of a mine by allowing us to cost effectively process ore types that were previously considered uneconomic 
acquisitions may also contribute to increase ore reserves and we review potential acquisition opportunities on a regular basis 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue with our strategy to replenish reserves indefinitely 

table of contents our business requires levels of capital expenditures which we may not be able to maintain 
our business is capital intensive 
specifically  the exploration and exploitation of copper and other metal reserves  mining  smelting and refining costs  the maintenance of machinery and equipment and compliance with laws and regulations require significant capital expenditures 
we must continue to invest capital to maintain or to increase the amount of copper reserves that we exploit and the amount of copper and other metals we produce 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our production levels to generate sufficient cash  or that we have access to sufficient financing to continue our exploration  exploitation and refining activities at or above present levels 
restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our minera mexico subsidiary may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our financing instruments and those of our minera mexico subsidiary include financial and other restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our and minera mexico s abilities to incur additional debt and sell assets 
if either we or our minera mexico subsidiary do not comply with these obligations  we could be in default under the applicable agreements which  if not addressed or waived  could require repayment of the indebtedness immediately 
our minera mexico subsidiary is further limited by the terms of its outstanding notes  which also restrict the company s applicable incurrence of debt and liens 
in addition  future credit facilities may contain limitations on our incurrence of additional debt and liens  on our ability to dispose of assets  or on our ability to pay dividends to our common stockholders 
applicable law restricts the payment of dividends from our minera mexico subsidiary to us 
our subsidiary  minera mexico  is a mexican company and  as such  may pay dividends only out of net income that has been approved by the shareholders 
shareholders must also approve the actual dividend payment  after mandatory legal reserves have been created and losses for prior fiscal years have been satisfied 
as a result  these legal constraints may limit the ability of minera mexico to pay dividends to us  which in turn  may have an impact on our ability to pay stockholder dividends or to service debt 
our operations are subject to risks  some of which are not insurable 
the business of mining  smelting and refining copper  zinc and other metals is subject to a number of risks and hazards  including industrial accidents  labor disputes  unusual or unexpected geological conditions  changes in the regulatory environment  environmental hazards and weather and other natural phenomena  including earthquakes 
such occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  mining operations resulting in monetary losses and possible legal liability 
in particular  surface and underground mining and related processing activities present inherent risks of injury to personnel and damage to equipment 
we maintain insurance against many of these and other risks  which may not provide adequate coverage in certain circumstances 
insurance against certain risks  including certain liabilities for environmental damage or hazards as a result of exploration and production  is not generally available to us or other companies within the mining industry 
nevertheless recent environmental legal initiatives have considered future regulations regarding environmental damage insurance 
in case such regulations come into force  we will have to analyze the need to obtain such insurance 
we do not have  and do not intend to obtain  political risk insurance 
these or other uninsured events may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
deliveries under our copper sales agreements can be suspended or cancelled by our customers in certain cases 
under our sales agreements  we or our customers may suspend or cancel delivery of copper during a period of force majeure 
events of force majeure under these agreements include acts of nature  labor strikes  fires  floods  wars  transportation delays  government actions or other events that are beyond the control of the parties 
any suspension or cancellation by our customers of deliveries under our sales contracts that are not replaced by deliveries under new contracts or sales on the spot market would reduce our cash flow and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the copper mining industry is highly competitive 
we face competition from other copper mining and producing companies around the world 
we cannot assure you that competition will not adversely affect us in the future 

table of contents in addition  mines have limited lives and  as a result  we must periodically seek to replace and expand our reserves by acquiring new properties 
significant competition exists to acquire properties producing or capable of producing copper and other metals 
the mining industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years  including consolidation among some of our main competitors  as a result of which an increased percentage of copper production is from companies that also produce other products and may  consequently  be more diversified than we are 
we cannot assure you that the result of current or future consolidation in the industry will not adversely affect us 
potential changes to international trade agreements  trade concessions or other political and economic arrangements may benefit copper producers operating in countries other than peru and mexico  where our mining operations are currently located 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable trading or other arrangements 
interruptions of energy supply or increases in energy costs and other production costs may adversely affect our results of operations 
we require substantial amounts of fuel oil  electricity and other resources for our operations 
fuel  gas and power costs constituted approximately and of our total production cost in and  respectively 
we rely upon third parties for our supply of the energy resources consumed in our operations 
the prices for and availability of energy resources may be subject to change or curtailment  respectively  due to  among other things  new laws or regulations  imposition of new taxes or tariffs  interruptions in production by suppliers  worldwide price levels and market conditions 
disruptions in energy supply or increases in costs of energy resources or increases of other production costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
shortages of water supply  critical parts  equipment and skilled labor may adversely affect our operations and development projects 
our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining  ore processing and related support facilities 
although each operation currently has sufficient water rights to cover its operational demands  the loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines or operations  in whole or in part  or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities 
additionally  we have not yet secured adequate water rights to support all of our announced expansion projects  and our inability to secure those rights could prevent us from pursuing some of those opportunities 
in addition  future shortages of critical parts  equipment and skilled labor could adversely affect our operations and development projects 
our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions 
we are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions 
our industry is cyclical by nature and fluctuates with economic cycles  including the current global economic instability 
the weakness in the global economy has been marked by  among other adverse factors  lower levels of consumer and corporate confidence  decreased business investment and consumer spending  increased unemployment  reduced income and asset values in many areas  currency volatility and limited availability of credit and access to capital 
if the united states and the world wide economic recovery continues to be weak or deteriorates or if chinese economic growth weakens  it could have an impact on our business and our financial condition 
we cannot predict if the administrative and legislative actions taken in the united states and elsewhere in the world to address this situation will be successful in reducing the severity or duration of the economic instability 
the continuation or intensification of the slow global economic recovery and the sovereign debt crisis in europe or elsewhere may prompt banks to limit or deny lending to us or to our customers  which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and on our ability to carry out our announced capital investment programs 
additionally  concerns over the slow recovery in the united states and elsewhere in the world may prompt our customers to slow down or reduce the purchase of our products 
we may experience longer sales cycles  difficulty in collecting sales proceeds  and lower prices for our products 
a change in the demand of our products could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot provide any assurance that any of these events will not 
table of contents have a material adverse effect on market conditions  prices of our securities  our ability to obtain financing  and our results of operations and financial condition 
environmental  health and safety laws  regulatory response to climate change  and other regulations may increase our costs of doing business  restrict our operations or result in operational delays 
our exploration  mining  milling  smelting and refining activities are subject to a number of peruvian and mexican laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations  as well as certain industry technical standards 
additional matters subject to regulation include  but are not limited to  concession fees  transportation  production  water use and discharge  power use and generation  use and storage of explosives  surface rights  housing and other facilities for workers  reclamation  taxation  labor standards  mine safety and occupational health 
we are required to comply with occupational health and safety laws and regulations in peru and mexico where our operations are subject to periodic inspections by the relevant governmental authorities 
these laws and regulations govern  among others  health and safety work place conditions  including high risk labor and the handling  storage and disposal of chemical and other hazardous substances 
we believe our operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate 
compliance with these laws and regulations and new or existing regulations that may be applicable to us in the future could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our financial results of operations and cash flows 
we regularly monitor occupational health and safety performance and compliance through programs  reports and activities at our operations 
accidents are reported to mexican and peruvian authorities as required 
in  we had three fatalities in mexico  three contractor employees and three fatalities in peru  two company employees and one contractor employee 
in  we had one fatality in mexico  one contractor employee  and three fatalities in peru  two company employees and one contractor employee 
the amounts paid to the mexican and peruvian authorities for reportable accidents did not have a material impact on our results 
under mexican and peruvian law penalties and fines for safety violations are generally monetary  but in certain cases may lead to the temporary or permanent shutdown of the affected facility or the suspension or revocation of permits or licenses 
in and  we were not subject to material penalties or sanctions and we did not experience any shutdowns of our work areas 
also  violation of security and safety laws and regulations in our peruvian operations can be considered a crime  with penalties of up to years of prison 
environmental regulations in peru and mexico have become increasingly stringent over the last decade and we have been required to dedicate more time and money to compliance and remediation activities 
furthermore  mexican authorities have become more rigorous and strict in enforcing mexican environmental laws 
we expect additional laws and regulations will be enacted over time with respect to environmental matters 
the principal legislation applicable to the company s mexican operations is the federal general law of ecological balance and environmental protection the general law  which is enforced by the federal bureau of environmental protection profepa 
profepa monitors compliance with environmental legislation and enforces mexican environmental laws  regulations and official standards 
profepa may initiate administrative proceedings against companies that violate environmental laws  which in the most extreme cases may result in the temporary or permanent closing of non complying facilities  the revocation of operating licenses and or other sanctions or fines 
also  according to the federal criminal code  profepa must inform corresponding authorities regarding environmental non compliance 
on january   article of the general law was amended 
this amendment  gives an individual or entity the ability to contest administrative acts  including environmental authorizations  permits or concessions granted  without the need to demonstrate the actual existence of harm to the environment  natural resources  flora  fauna or human health  because it will be sufficient to argue that the harm may be caused 
as a result of the amendment  more legal actions supported or sponsored by non governmental groups  interested in halting projects  and not necessarily in protecting the rights of affected communities may be filed against companies operating in all industrial sectors  including the mining sector 
in addition  on august   amendments to the civil federal procedures code cfpc were published in the official gazette and are now in force 
these amendments establish three categories of collective actions  by means of which or more people claiming injury derived from environmental  consumer protection  financial services and economic competition issues will be considered to be sufficient in order to have a legitimate interest to seek through a civil procedure restitution or 
table of contents economic compensation or suspension of the activities from which the alleged injury derived 
the amendments to the cfpc may result in more litigation  with plaintiffs seeking remedies  including suspension of the activities alleged to cause harm 
on december   the mexican senate chamber approved the environmental liability federal law  which establishes general guidelines in order to determine which environmental actions will be considered to cause environmental harm that will give rise to administrative responsibilities remediation or compensations and criminal responsibilities 
also economic fines could be established 
this initiative has been returned to the lower chamber for discussion and voting 
the law will be in force once approved by the lower chamber and signed by the president 
in and  peruvian environmental laws imposing closure and remediation obligations on the mining industry were enacted 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
in  we decided to recognize an estimated asset retirement obligation for our mining properties in mexico as part of our environmental commitment 
even though  there is currently no enacted law  statute  ordinance  or written or oral contract requiring us to carry out mine closure and environmental remediation activities  we considered that a constructive obligation presently exists based on  among other things  the remediation experience from the closure of the san luis potosi smelter in we further discuss these obligations in our note asset retirement obligation to our consolidated financial statements 
moreover  our mexican operations are also subject to the environmental agreement entered into by mexico  the united states and canada in connection with the north american free trade agreement 
this agreement  as well as new international treaties regarding human rights  contains environmental provisions and initiatives 
we believe our operations are in material compliance with all environmental laws and regulations within the areas we operate 
regulatory response to climate change  restrictions  caps  taxes  or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses  including on emissions from the combustion of carbon based fuels  could significantly increase our operating costs 
restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers 
a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change 
these regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers 
the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain  and would be particular to the geographic circumstances of our facilities 
these may include changes in rainfall patterns  water shortages  changing sea levels  changing storm patterns and intensities  and changing temperatures 
these effects may adversely impact the cost  production and financial performance of our operations 
the development of more stringent environmental protection programs in peru and mexico and in relevant trade agreements could impose constraints and additional costs on our operations and require us to make significant capital expenditures in the future 
we cannot assure you that current or future legislative  regulatory or trade developments will not have an adverse effect on our business  properties  operating results  financial condition or prospects 
our metals exploration efforts are highly speculative in nature and may be unsuccessful 
metals exploration is highly speculative in nature  involves many risks and is frequently unsuccessful 
once mineralization is discovered  it may take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling before production is possible  during which time the economic feasibility of production may change 
substantial expenditures are required to establish proven and probable ore reserves through drilling  to determine metallurgical processes to extract the metals from the ore and  in the case of new properties  to construct mining and processing facilities 
we cannot assure you that our exploration programs will result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new proven and probable ore reserves 
development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of proven and probable ore reserves and estimates of future cash operating costs 
estimates are  to a large extent  based upon the interpretation of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques  and feasibility studies that derive estimates of cash operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed  the configuration of the ore body  expected recovery rates of the mineral from the ore  comparable facility and equipment operating costs  anticipated climatic conditions and other factors 
as a result  actual cash operating costs and economic returns based upon development of 
table of contents proven and probable ore reserves may differ significantly from those originally estimated 
moreover  significant decreases in actual or expected prices may mean reserves  once found  will be uneconomical to produce 
our profits may be negatively affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the us dollar is our functional currency and our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  portions of our operating costs are denominated in peruvian nuevos soles and mexican pesos 
accordingly  when inflation in peru or mexico increases without a corresponding devaluation of the nuevo sol or the mexican peso our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
to manage the volatility related to the risk of currency rate fluctuations  we may enter into forward exchange contracts 
we cannot assure you  however  that currency fluctuations will not have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our assets  earnings and cash flows are influenced by various currencies due to the geographic diversity of our sales and the countries in which we operate 
as some of our costs are incurred in currencies other than our functional currency  the us dollar  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our financial results 
these costs principally include electricity  labor  maintenance  local contractors and fuel 
for the year ended december   a substantial portion of our costs were denominated in a currency other than us dollars 
operating costs are influenced by the currencies of the countries where our mines and processing plants are located and also by those currencies in which the costs of equipment and services are determined 
the peruvian nuevo sol  the mexican peso and the us dollar are the currencies which most influence our costs 
further  in the past there has been a strong correlation between copper prices and the exchange rate of the us dollar 
a strengthening of the us dollar may therefore be accompanied by lower copper prices  which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by challenges relating to slope stability 
our open pit mines get deeper as we mine them  presenting certain geotechnical challenges including the possibility of slope failure 
if we are required to decrease pit slope angles or provide additional road access to prevent such a failure  our stated reserves could be negatively affected 
further  hydrological conditions relating to pit slopes  renewal of material displaced by slope failures and increased stripping requirements could also negatively affect our stated reserves 
we have taken actions in order to maintain slope stability  but we cannot assure you that we will not have to take additional action in the future or that our actions taken to date will be sufficient 
unexpected failure or additional requirements to prevent slope failure may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition  as well as have the effect of diminishing our stated ore reserves 
we may be adversely affected by labor disputes 
in the last several years we have experienced a number of strikes or other labor disruptions that have had an adverse impact on our operations and operating results 
as of december   unions represented approximately of our workforce 
currently  we have labor agreements in effect for our mexican operations 
at our peruvian operations  collective bargaining agreements with the eight unions expired in during  we started negotiations with all the eight unions 
during the first two months of  we have signed three year agreements with all the unions 
the agreements include  among other things  annual salary increases of  and for each of the three years  respectively  for all workers 
in june  a work stoppage at our buenavista mine was finally resolved after a period of three years 
the mine property was rehabilitated and production was fully restored in the second quarter of additionally  our taxco and san martin mines have been on strike since july it is expected that operations at these mines will remain suspended until these labor issues are resolved 
we cannot assure you when these strikes will be settled  or that in the future we will not experience strikes or other labor related work stoppages that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our new mining or metal production projects may be subject to additional costs due to community actions and other factors 
our exploration  mining  milling  smelting and refining activities are subject to peruvian and mexican laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations  as well as certain industry technical standards 
as in any other country  environmental regulations in peru and mexico have become increasingly stringent over the last decades 
in accordance with mining regulations in the countries where we operate  we have to submit an environmental impact assessment eia for all our new mining projects or expansions of existing mining operations and or facilities 
the eia is then discussed at various open hearings with the local communities  where they have the opportunity to voice their opinion and or concerns 
in peru  the ministry of energy and mines minem usually requires the mining companies to address the questions of the stakeholders 
minem is the entity that approves the eia and the execution of mining projects 
in december  the servicio nacional de certificacion ambiental para inversiones sostenible senace was created  and this governmental organization is in the process to assume responsibility to approve all eia s related to the exploitation and processing phases 
tia maria  a peruvian investment project of over billion was suspended by governmental action in april in light of protests and disruptions carried out by a small group of activists who alleged  among other things  that the project would result in severe environmental contamination and the diversion of agricultural water resources 
we are preparing a new eia study which we believe will take into account local community concerns and new government guidance 
we consider that this new eia process will alleviate all the concerns previously raised by the tia maria project s neighboring communities  provide them with an independent source of information and reaffirm the validity of the company s assessment of the project 
we are confident that this initiative will have a positive effect on our stakeholders and will allow us to obtain the approval for the development of the  ton annual production copper project 
we have legal and valid title to the tia maria mining concessions and the over lapping surface land in the area 
none of above noted activities have in any way challenged  revoked  impaired or annulled our legal rights to the tia maria mining concessions and or the over lapping surface land titles acquired in the past 
all our property rights on these areas are in full force 
toquepala concentrator expansion as a result of protests from some community groups the approval process for the eia of this project has been delayed 
these groups raised concerns related to water usage and pollution 
as a result of these issues  the peruvian government during started discussions with the local communities and the regional authorities to resolve this impasse 
we participated also in a working group with the local and regional authorities and communities to define company support for their social and community programs 
on february   we reached a final agreement with the province of candarave  one of the three provinces neighboring our toquepala unit  which commits us to funding s 
million approximately million for community development projects in the province 
this agreement is contingent upon receiving approval for the project 
we expect to continue working with the candarave province and the other two provinces neighboring toquepala to resolve all open issues during the project will not use additional fresh water and therefore will not affect the availability of this resource for community or agricultural use 
in fact  water currently used by the company comes from deep wells drilled into the capulline formation aquifer and does not take water from the population and agricultural communities of tacna and moquegua 
as we indicated above for the toquepala expansion project  it appears that it is becoming a part of the peruvian mining environment  that in order to obtain acceptance from local communities for projects in their localities  demands for substantial investments in community infrastructure and upgrades must be met in order to proceed with the mining projects 
we cannot assure that we will not continue to incur additional costs for community infrastructure and upgrades in order to obtain the approval of current or future mining projects 
we are confident that we will continue with the tia maria and the toquepala projects 
however  these projects  or any other project which we may undertake in the future  may be subject to additional costs as a result of delays due to actions by members of the local community or other factors 

table of contents we are controlled by grupo mexico  which exercises control over our affairs and policies and whose interests may be different from yours 
at december   grupo mexico owned indirectly of our capital stock 
certain of our and minera mexico s officers and directors are also directors and or officers of grupo mexico and or of its affiliates 
we cannot assure you that the interests of grupo mexico will not conflict with ours 
grupo mexico has the ability to determine the outcome of substantially all matters submitted for a vote to our stockholders and thus exercises control over our business policies and affairs  including the following the composition of our board of directors and  as a result  any determinations of our board with respect to our business direction and policy  including the appointment and removal of our officers  determinations with respect to mergers and other business combinations  including those that may result in a change of control  whether dividends are paid or other distributions are made and the amount of any dividends or other distributions  sales and dispositions of our assets  and the amount of debt financing that we incur 
we cannot assure you that increased financial obligations of grupo mexico or amc resulting from financings or for other reasons will not result in our parent corporations obtaining loans  increased dividends or other funding from us 
in addition  we have in the past engaged in  and expect to continue to engage in  transactions with grupo mexico and its other affiliates which are related party transactions and may present conflicts of interest 
for additional information regarding the share ownership of  and our relationships with  grupo mexico and its affiliates  see note related party transactions 
we may not continue to pay a significant amount of our net income as cash dividends on our common stock in the future 
we have distributed a significant amount of our net income as dividends since our dividend practice is subject to change at the discretion of our board of directors at any time 
the amount that we pay in dividends is subject to a number of factors  including our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements  tax considerations  future prospects  legal restrictions  contractual restrictions in credit agreements  limitations imposed by the government of peru  mexico or other countries where we have significant operations and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
in light of our capital investment program and the current global economic conditions  it is possible that future dividend distributions will be reduced from the levels of recent years 
international risks we are a company with substantial assets located outside of the united states 
we conduct production operations in peru and mexico and exploration activities in these countries as well as in chile  argentina and ecuador 
accordingly  in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries  our business may be adversely affected by political  economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries 
such risks include possible expropriation or nationalization of property  confiscatory taxes or royalties  possible foreign exchange controls  changes in the national policy toward foreign investors  etc 
our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks 
consequently  our production  development and exploration activities in these countries could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control  some of which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents risks associated with doing business in peru and mexico there is uncertainty as to the termination and renewal of our mining concessions 
under the laws of peru and mexico  mineral resources belong to the state and government concessions are required in both countries to explore for or exploit mineral reserves 
in peru  our mineral rights derive from concessions from the peruvian ministry of energy and mines for our exploration  exploitation  extraction and or production operations 
in mexico  our mineral rights derive from concessions granted  on a discretionary basis  by the ministry of economy  pursuant to the mexican mining law and regulations thereunder 
mining concessions in both peru and mexico may be terminated if the obligations of the concessionaire are not satisfied 
in peru  we are obligated to pay certain fees for our mining concession 
in mexico  we are obligated  among other things  to explore or exploit the relevant concession  to pay any relevant fees  to comply with all environmental and safety standards  to provide information to the ministry of economy and to allow inspections by the ministry of economy 
any termination or unfavorable modification of the terms of one or more of our concessions  or failure to obtain renewals of such concessions subject to renewal or extensions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects 
peruvian economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business 
a significant part of our operations are conducted in peru 
accordingly  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be affected by changes in economic or other policies of the peruvian government or other political  regulatory or economic developments in peru 
during the past several decades  peru has had a history of political instability that has included military coups and a succession of regimes with differing policies and programs 
past governments have frequently intervened in the nation s economy and social structure 
among other actions  past governments have imposed controls on prices  exchange rates and local and foreign investments  as well as limitations on imports  have restricted the ability of companies to dismiss employees  have expropriated private sector assets including mining companies and have prohibited the remittance of profits to foreign investors 
in the last years peru has had political and social stability 
the peruvian government s economic policies reduced inflation and the peruvian economy has experienced significant growth in recent years 
in october  peru had regional and mayoral elections and in june peru elected a new president 
because we have significant operations in peru  we cannot provide any assurance that political developments and economic conditions in peru and or other factors will not have a material adverse effect on market conditions  prices of our securities  our ability to obtain financing  and our results of operations and financial condition 
mexican economic and political conditions  as well as drug related violence  may have an adverse impact on our business 
the mexican economy is highly sensitive to economic developments in the united states  mainly because of its high level of exports to the united states market 
the global financial crisis and the subsequent downturn in the united states economy caused real gross domestic product in mexico to fall in mexico s policy measures in response to the crisis and its prior economic performance have helped the economy begin a recovery 
gross domestic product grew by and in and  respectively  and is projected to grow by at least in other possible risks are increases in taxes on the mining sector or higher royalties 
as has occurred in other metal producing countries  the mining industry may be perceived as a source of additional fiscal revenue 
regarding the political situation in mexico  security institutions are under significant stress  as a result of drug related violence 
this situation creates potential risks especially for transportation of minerals and finished products  which affect a small part of our production 
however  drug related violence has had a limited impact on our operations as it has tended to concentrate outside our areas of production 
if this were to change  the risk to our operations might increase 
on july   voters elected a new president and members of the chambers of deputies and senators in mexico for a six year period 

table of contents because we have significant operations in mexico  we cannot provide any assurance that political developments and economic conditions  as well as drug related violence  in mexico will not have a material adverse effect on market conditions  prices of our securities  our ability to obtain financing  and our results of operations and financial condition 
peruvian inflation and fluctuations in the nuevo sol exchange rate may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
over the past several years  peru has experienced one of its best economic periods 
in peru economic conditions have improved significantly in the last years 
inflation in  and was  and  respectively 
the value of the nuevo sol has appreciated against the us dollar  in  in and in our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars and our operating expenses are partly denominated in us dollars 
if inflation in peru were to increase without a corresponding depreciation of the nuevo sol relative to the us dollar  our financial position and results of operations  and the market price of our common stock  could be affected 
although the peruvian government s economic policy reduced inflation and the economy has experienced significant growth in recent years  we cannot assure you that inflation will not increase from its current level or that such growth will continue in the future at similar rates or at all 
additionally the global financial economic crisis  could negatively affect the peruvian economy 
mexican inflation  restrictive exchange control policies and fluctuations in the peso exchange rate may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
although all of our mexican operations sales of metals are priced and invoiced in us dollars  a substantial portion of our mexican operations cost of sales are denominated in pesos 
accordingly  when inflation in mexico increases without a corresponding depreciation of the peso the net income generated by our mexican operations is adversely affected 
the annual inflation rate in mexico was in  in and in the bank of mexico has publicly announced a target of inflation for at the same time  the peso has been subject in the past to significant volatility  which may not have been proportionate to the inflation rate and may not be proportionate to the inflation rate in the future 
the value of the peso decreased by in  decreased by in  and increased by in the mexican government does not currently restrict the ability of mexican companies or individuals to convert pesos into dollars or other currencies 
while we do not expect the mexican government to impose any restriction or exchange control policies in the future  it is an area we closely monitor 
we cannot assure you the mexican government will maintain its current policies with regard to the peso or that the peso s value will not fluctuate significantly in the future 
the imposition of exchange control policies could impair minera mexico s ability to obtain imported goods and to meet its us dollar denominated obligations and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
developments in other emerging market countries and in the united states may adversely affect the prices of our common stock and our debt securities 
the market value of securities of companies with significant operations in peru and mexico is  to varying degrees  affected by economic and market conditions in other emerging market countries 
although economic conditions in such countries may differ significantly from economic conditions in peru or mexico  as the case may be  investors reactions to developments in any of these other countries may have an adverse effect on the market value or trading price of the securities  including debt securities  of issuers that have significant operations in peru or mexico 
in addition  in recent years economic conditions in mexico have increasingly become correlated to us economic conditions 
therefore  adverse economic conditions in the united states could also have a significant adverse effect on mexican economic conditions  including the price of our common stock or debt securities 
we cannot assure you that the market value or trading prices of our common stock and debt securities  will not be adversely affected by events in the united states or elsewhere  including in emerging market countries

review of operations the following maps set forth the locations of our principal mines  smelting facilities and refineries 
we operate open pit copper mines in the southern part of peru at toquepala and cuajone and in mexico  principally at la caridad and buenavista 
we also operate five underground mines that produce zinc  copper  silver and gold  as well as a coal mine and a coke oven 

gbeijpg 
extraction  smelting and refining processes our operations include open pit and underground mining  concentrating  copper smelting  copper refining  copper rod production  solvent extraction electrowinning sxew  zinc refining  sulfuric acid production  molybdenum concentrate production and silver and gold refining 
the extraction and production process are summarized below 
open pit mining in an open pit mine  the production process begins at the mine pit  where waste rock  leaching ore and copper ore are drilled and blasted and then loaded onto diesel electric trucks by electric shovels 
waste is hauled to dump areas and leaching ore is hauled to leaching dumps 
the ore to be milled is transported to the primary crushers 

table of contents underground mining in an underground mine  the production process begins at the stopes  where copper  zinc and lead veins are drilled and blasted and the ore is hauled to the underground crusher station 
the crushed ore is then hoisted to the surface for processing 
concentrating the copper ore with a copper grade over from the primary crusher or the copper  zinc and lead bearing ore from the underground mines is transported to a concentrator plant where gyratory crushers break the ore into sizes no larger than three quarter of an inch 
the ore is then sent to a mill section where it is ground to the consistency of fine powder 
the finely ground ore is mixed with water and chemical reagents and pumped as a slurry to the flotation separator where it is mixed with certain chemicals 
in the flotation separator  reagent solutions and air pumped into the flotation cells cause the minerals to separate from the waste rock and bubble to the surface where they are collected and dried 
if the bulk concentrated copper contains molybdenum it is first processed in a molybdenum plant as described below under molybdenum production 
copper smelting copper concentrates are transported to a smelter  where they are smelted using a furnace  converter and anode furnace to produce either blister copper which is in the form of cakes with air pockets or copper anodes which are cleaned of air pockets 
at the smelter  the concentrates are mixed with flux a chemical substance intentionally included for high temperature processing and then sent to reverberatory furnaces producing copper matte and slag a mixture of iron and other impurities 
copper matte contains approximately copper 
copper matte is then sent to the converters  where the material is oxidized in two steps i the iron sulfides in the matte are oxidized with silica  producing slag that is returned to the reverberatory furnaces  and ii the copper contained in the matte sulfides is then oxidized to produce copper that  after casting  is called blister copper  containing approximately to copper  or anodes  containing approximately copper 
some of the blister and anode production is sold to customers and the remainder is sent to the refinery 
copper refining anodes are suspended in tanks containing sulfuric acid and copper sulfate 
a weak electrical current is passed through the anodes and chemical solution and the dissolved copper is deposited on very thin starting sheets to produce copper cathodes containing approximately copper 
during this process  silver  gold and other metals for example  palladium  platinum and selenium  along with other impurities  settle on the bottom of the tank anodic slime 
this anodic slime is processed at a precious metal plant where selenium  silver and gold are recovered 
copper rod plant to produce copper rod  copper cathodes are first smelted in a furnace and then dosified in a casting machine 
the dosified copper is then extruded and passed through a cooling system that begins solidification of copper into a millimeter copper bar 
the resulting copper bar is gradually stretched in a rolling mill to achieve the desired diameter 
the rolled bar is then cooled and sprayed with wax as a preservation agent and collected into a rod coil that is compacted and sent to market 
solvent extraction electrowinning sxew an alternative to the conventional concentrator smelter refinery process is the leaching and sxew process 
during the sxew process  certain types of low grade ore with a copper grade under are leached with sulfuric acid to allow copper content recovery 
the acid and copper solution is then agitated with a solvent that contains chemical additives that attract copper ions 
as the solvent is lighter than water  it floats to the surface carrying with it the copper content 
the solvent is then separated using an acid solution  freeing the copper 
the acid solution containing the copper is then moved to electrolytic extraction tanks to produce copper cathodes 
refined copper can be produced more economically though over a longer period and from lower grade ore using the sxew process instead of the traditional concentrating  smelting and refining process 

table of contents molybdenum production molybdenum is recovered from copper molybdenum concentrates produced at the concentrator 
the copper molybdenum concentrate is first treated with a thickener until it becomes slurry with solids 
the slurry is then agitated in a chemical and water solution and pumped to the flotation separator 
the separator creates a froth that carries molybdenum to the surface but not the copper mineral which is later filtered to produce copper concentrates containing approximately copper 
the molybdenum froth is skimmed off  filtered and dried to produce molybdenum concentrates of approximately contained molybdenum 
zinc refining metallic zinc is produced through electrolysis using zinc concentrates and zinc oxides 
sulfur is eliminated from the concentrates by roasting and the zinc oxide is dissolved in sulfuric acid solution to eliminate solid impurities 
the purified zinc sulfide solution is treated by electrolysis to produce refined zinc and to separate silver and gold  which are recovered as concentrates 
sulfuric acid production sulfur dioxide gases are produced in the copper smelting and zinc roasting processes 
as a part of our environmental preservation program  we treat the sulfur dioxide emissions at two of our mexican plants and at peruvian processing facilities to produce sulfuric acid  some of which is  in turn  used for the copper leaching process  with the rest sold to mining and fertilizer companies located principally in mexico  peru  united states  chile and other countries 
silver and gold refining silver and gold are recovered from copper  zinc and lead concentrates in the smelters and refineries  and from slimes through electrolytic refining

table of contents slope stability peruvian operations the toquepala and cuajone pits are approximately meters and meters deep  respectively 
under the present mine plan configuration the toquepala pit will reach a depth of  meters and the cuajone pit will reach a depth of  meters 
the deepening pits present us with a number of geotechnical challenges 
perhaps the foremost concern is the possibility of slope failure  a possibility that all open pit mines face 
in order to maintain slope stability  in the past we have decreased pit slope angles  installed additional or duplicate haul road access  and increased stripping requirements 
we have also responded to hydrological conditions and removed material displaced by slope failures 
to meet the geotechnical challenges relating to slope stability of the open pit mines  we have taken the following steps in the late s we hosted round table meetings in vancouver  bc with a group of recognized slope stability and open pit mining specialists 
the agenda for these meetings was principally a review of pit design for mines with greater than meter depth 
the discussions included practices for monitoring  data collection and blasting processes 
based on the concepts defined at the vancouver meetings  we initiated slope stability studies to define the mining of reserves by optimum design 
these studies were performed by outside consultants and included slope stability appraisals  evaluation of the numerical modeling  slope performance and inter ramp angle design and evaluation of hydrological conditions 
the studies were completed in and we believe we implemented the study recommendations 
one of the major changes implemented was slope angle reduction at both mines  toquepala by an average of five degrees and cuajone by an average of seven degrees 
although this increased the waste included in the mineable reserve calculation  it also improved the stability of the pits 
in the toquepala mine in we installed meter wide geotechnical berms every benches 
we believe this will further strengthen the stability of the toquepala pit 
since  a wall depressurization program has been in place in both pits 
this consists of a horizontal drilling program  which improves drainage thereby reducing saturation and increasing wall stability 
additionally  a new blasting control program was put in place  implementing vibration monitoring and blasting designs of low punctual energy 
also a new slope monitoring system was implemented using reflection prisms  deformation inclinometers and piezometers for water level control  as well as real time robotic monitoring equipment 
in february  a monitoring slope radar system was put in place at the cuajone mine 
this system improves the reliability of instrumentation  the information quality for assessing the behavior of the slopes and anticipates the risks of instability 
in  a program of oriented and conventional geotechnical drilling was executed at the toquepala mine  totaling  meters 
at the cuajone mine   meters of a horizontal geotechnical drilling program was carried out for slope drainage 
in october  we started a  meter program of oriented and conventional geotechnical drilling which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter this program will update the geotechnical study for the new years mine development plan 
to increase the possibility of mining in the event of a slide  we have provided for two ramps of extraction for each open pit mine 
on march  srk consulting chile concluded the geotechnical study of the current slope and mining plans for and with recommendations to improve the slope stability 
while these measures cannot guarantee that a slope failure will not occur  we believe that our mining practices are sound and that the steps taken and the ongoing reviews performed are a prudent methodology for open pit mining 
mexican operations in  our year mine plan study for the la caridad mine was awarded to an independent consulting firm to conduct a geotechnical evaluation 
the purpose of the plan was to develop a program of optimum bench design and inter ramp slope angles for the open pit 
a number of recommendations and observations were presented by the consultants 
these included a recommendation of a maximum average bench face angle of degrees 
additionally  single benching was recommended 
table of contents for the upper sections of the west  south and east walls of the main pit 
likewise  double benching was recommended for the lower levels of the main pit and single benching for the upper slope segments that consist of either alluvial material  mine waste dumps or mineralized stockpile material 
alternatively  slopes in these types of materials  may be designed with an overall degree slope 
the geoestructural and geotechnical parameters recommended were applied in the pit design for the new life of the mine plan for la caridad mine prepared in this mine plan replaced the year mine plan prepared in however  since final pit limits have not been yet established at la caridad  all current pit walls are effectively working slopes 
geostructural and geotechnical data collected at the open pit mine from cell mapping and oriented core drilling databases provided the basis for the geotechnical evaluation and recommendations 
we continue to collect new information related to geotechnical data and other geology features in order to ensure the structural security and also to improve the geotechnical data base for future studies at the buenavista mine  we are following the recommendations of a geotechnical evaluation of design slope for the year pit plan 
this evaluation was prepared by an independent mine consulting firm 
this evaluation included the determination of optimum pit slope design angles and bench design parameters for the proposed mine plan 
the objective of the study was to determine optimum inter ramp slope angles and bench design parameters for the year plan and to identify and analyze any potential major instability that could adversely impact mine operation 
in  we installed a radar system to monitor the walls of the mine 
the following recommendations were made for the buenavista mine inter ramp slope design angles for the year pit plan  for all of the design sectors  defined on a rock fabric based catch bench analysis  using double bench  can range from and  and the inter ramp slope angles are based on geometries that resulted from the back break analysis using reliability of achieving the required meter catch bench width for a single bench configuration and meter catch bench width for a double bench configuration 
preliminary observations suggest the year pit walls may be relative free draining  the back break analysis assumed depressurized conditions of mine benches  and the inter ramp stability analysis were performed for both  saturated and depressurized conditions 
a pit dewatering depressurization plan for the buenavista mine was also recommended to address the issues of open pit drainage  dewatering plan and future slope depressurization 
phase i of the geohydrological study was completed by an independent consultant 
the analysis included a preliminary assessment and work plan implementations 
in  five wells for extraction and monitoring were drilled close to the mine 
also  we began a drilling program to monitor possible water filtration beyond the limits of the open pit mine 
all the information obtained from these well drilling programs has been analyzed and included in the hydrologic model 
the open pit dewatering program from the bottom benches also continued during with a drilling program of  meters in several monitoring wells in order to allow us to continue with the current mining plan

geology the buenavista mining district lies on the southern cordilleran orogen  which extends from southern mexico to northwestern united states 
it also falls within the basin and range metallogenic province 
geological and structural features in the district are representative of large  disseminated type  porphyry copper deposits 
a calcareous sedimentary sequence of lower paleozoic age  lithologically correlated with a similar section in southeastern arizona  uncomformably overlies precambrian granite basement 
the entire section was covered by volcanic rocks of mesozoic age and later intruded by deep seated granodiorite batholith of tertiary age  with further quartz monzonite porphyry differentiates of laramide age 
mineralization in the district is extensive covering a surface area of approximately square kilometers 
an early pegmatitic stage associated with bornite chalcopyrite molybdenite assemblage was followed by a widespread flooding of hydrothermal solutions with quartz pyrite chalcopyrite 
a pervasive quartz sericite alteration is evident throughout the district s igneous rock fabric 
an extensive and economically important zone of supergene enrichment  with disseminated and stockworks of chalcocite cus  developed below the iron oxide capping 
this zone coincides with the topography and has an average thickness of meters 
a mixed zone of secondary and primary sulfides underlay the chalcocite blanket 
the hypogene mineralization  principally chalcopyrite  cufes  extensively underlies the orebody 
molybdenite occurs throughout the deposit and the content tends to increase with depth 
the buenavista copper porphyry is considered world class and unique 
the deepest exploration results in the core of the deposit have confirmed significant increase in copper grades 
similar porphyry copper deposits usually contain lower grades at depth 
the district is also unique for the occurrence of high grade breccia pipes  occurring in clusters following the trend of the district 
current dimensions of the mineralized ore body are x kilometers  and projects to more than kilometer at depth 
considering the geological and economic potential of the buenavista porphyry copper deposit  it is expected that the operation can support a sizeable increase in copper production capacity

table of contents ore reserves ore reserves are those estimated quantities of proven and probable material that may be economically mined and processed for extraction of their mineral content  at the time of the reserve determination 
proven measured reserves are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  b grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed samplings  and c the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable indicated reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
mineralized material  on the other hand  is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and or underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average grade of metal s 
such a deposit does not qualify as a reserve until legal and economic feasibility are concluded based upon a comprehensive evaluation of unit costs  grade  recoveries and other material factors 
our proven and probable ore reserve estimates are based on engineering evaluations of assay values derived from the sampling of drill holes and other openings 
we believe that the samplings taken are spaced at intervals sufficiently close enough and the geological characteristics of the deposits are sufficiently well defined to render the estimates reliable 
the ore reserves estimates include assessments of the resource  mining and metallurgy  as well as economic  marketing  legal  environmental  governmental  social and other necessary considerations 
our peruvian operations  including the toquepala and cuajone reserves  are classified into proven measured  probable indicated and possible inferred categories based on a rcb index relative confidence bound index that measures our level of geologic knowledge and confidence in each block 
the rcb index is a measure of relative confidence in the block grade estimate 
this approach combines the local variability of the composites used to krig a block with the kriging variance and incorporates the use of confidence intervals in measuring uncertainty of the block estimates relative to each other 
the final resource classification is then based on the distribution of these rcb values for blocks above copper 
it is the distribution that is used to find the breaks between proven probable and probable possible 
our mexican operations  including the buenavista and la caridad reserves  are calculated using a mathematical block model and applying the minesight software system 
the estimated grades per block are classified as proven and probable 
these grades are calculated applying a three dimensional interpolation procedure and the inverse distance squared 
likewise  the quadrant method or spherical search is implemented in order to limit the number of composites that will affect the block s interpolated value 
the composites data is derived from the geological exploration of the ore body 
in order to classify the individual blocks in the model  a thorough geostatistical variogram analysis is conducted  taking into consideration the principal characteristics of the deposit 
based on this block model classification  and with the implementation of the lerch grossman algorithm  and the minesight pit optimizer procedure  mineable reserves are determined 
the calculated proven and probable reserves include those blocks that are economically feasible to mine by open pit method within a particular mine design 
for the immsa unit  the basis for reserve estimations are sampling of mining operations and drilling exploration  geographical and topographic surveys  tracking down all the foregoing in the corresponding maps  measurement  calculation and interpretation based on the maps and reports from the mines  the mills and or smelters 
mineral reserves are mineral stock which is estimated for extraction  to exploit if necessary  to sell or utilize economically  all or in part  taking into consideration the quotations  subsidies  costs  availability of treatment plants and other conditions which we estimate will prevail in the period for which reserves are being calculated 
the reserves are divided into proven reliable or more according to statistical studies and probable reliable or more according to statistical studies categories according to their level of reliability and availability 
in order to comply with sec regulations  proven reserves is a classification that can only be used for such mineral found on top of the last level of the mine either mineral up to meters below the last level or below the first meters only with sufficient drilling or meters between each drill 
annually our engineering department reviews in detail the reserve computations 
in addition  our engineering department reviews the computation when changes in assumptions occur 
changes can occur for price or cost assumptions  results in field drilling or new geotechnical parameters 
we also engage third party consultants to review mine planning procedures 

table of contents pursuant to sec guidance  the reserves information in this report are calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years unless otherwise stated 
we refer to these three year average metals prices as current prices 
our current prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by comex  and our current prices for molybdenum are calculated according to platt s metals week 
unless otherwise stated  reserves estimates in this report use per pound for copper and per pound for molybdenum  both current prices as of december  the current prices for copper and molybdenum were and as of december  and and as of december   respectively 
for internal ore reserve estimation  our management uses long term metal price assumptions for copper and molybdenum  which are intended to approximate average prices over the long term 
at december   these price assumptions were per pound for copper and per pound for molybdenum 
at december   we changed our price assumption to reflect the changes in market trends to per pound of copper and per pound of molybdenum 
these prices continued at december  for other forecast and planning purposes  particularly related to merger and acquisition activities  our management considers various other price scenarios 
the use of these other price assumptions does not affect the preparation of our financial statements 
for the years  and  we have used reserves estimates based on current average prices as of the most recent year then ended to determine amortization of mine development and intangible assets 
we periodically reevaluate estimates of our ore reserves  which represent our estimate as to the amount of unmined copper remaining in our existing mine locations that can be produced and sold at a profit 
these estimates are based on engineering evaluations derived from samples of drill holes and other openings  combined with assumptions about copper market prices and production costs at each of our mines

table of contents overview of block model reconciliation process we apply the following block model to mill reconciliation procedure 
the following stages are identified at the cuajone  toquepala  buenavista and la caridad mines the mine geologists gather the necessary monthly statistical data from our information system srp  which provides ore tons milled and ore grades in the concentrator 
mined areas are topographically determined and related boundaries are built 
using the interactive planner option in our mining software minesight  ore tons and grades are calculated inside mined areas over the block model 
at this point the current cut off grade is considered

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to and should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  therefore  unless otherwise noted  the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for southern copper corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  scc  the company  our  and we on a consolidated basis for all periods 
our financial results may not be indicative of our future results 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
see item business cautionary statement 
executive overview business our business is primarily the production and sale of copper 
in the process of producing copper  a number of valuable metallurgical by products are recovered  which we also produce and sell 
market forces outside of our control largely determine the sale prices for our products 
our management  therefore  focuses on value creation through copper production  cost control  production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable 
we endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs  exploration efforts and cost reduction programs 
our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices 
we are one of the world s largest copper mining companies in terms of production and sales with our principal operations in peru and mexico 
we also have an active ongoing exploration program in chile and in we started exploration activities in argentina and ecuador 
in addition to copper we produce significant amounts of other metals  either as a by product of the copper process or in a number of dedicated mining facilities in mexico 
net sales value in of billion was only lower than sales  which were the highest in our company s history even though the average copper price in was lower and the prices for all our major by products were lower  as well 
this accomplishment was due to production increases in copper  silver and zinc 
net income decreased by about as a result of the lower prices and the one time court ordered legal fee payment of million 
without the deduction for these legal fees  net earnings would have been billion a decrease of from our record year of our buenavista mine  which is enjoying a stable work environment  reached a new production record of  tons of copper 
in  we invested  million in capital programs along with million in our exploration efforts 
we believe this commitment to growth will continue to benefit our company  our investors  our neighboring communities  and the countries in which we operate 
we believe we hold the world s largest copper reserve position 
our copper ore reserves  at december   totaled million tons of contained copper  calculated at a copper price of per pound as of december   the lme and comex copper price was and  respectively  as follows copper contained in ore reserves thousand tons mexican open pit peruvian operations immsa development projects total 
table of contents outlook various key factors will affect our outcome 
these include  but are not limited to  some of the following changes in copper and molybdenum prices the average lme and comex copper price was per pound in  about lower than in average silver and zinc prices in decreased about and molybdenum decreased about compared to sales structure in the last three years approximately of our revenues came from the sale of copper  from molybdenum  from silver and from various other products  including zinc  sulfuric acid  gold and other materials 
metal markets during the fourth quarter metal markets continued to be driven by the negative macroeconomic events that affected consumer expectations  the more significant being europe s debt crisis  the fiscal cliff that affected the us economy and the slowdown of china s economy 
was also a transition year  with administration changes or elections in several key countries  including china and the united states 
we believe the copper market fundamentals are sound  however  demand has been affected by macroeconomic factors and the economic slowdown noted in the previous paragraph 
at present  we perceive a more positive environment as some of these matters have been solved or are perceived to have a more positive outlook from now on 
in china  after several monetary easing measures were taken in the second half of  some analysts expect growth in chinese copper demand of approximately  for  better than the growth estimated for according to them  china represented of the world demand in the expected strong growth in china and other emerging economies should give support to the copper market in in the united states demand appears to be stronger as consumer confidence has increased and the economy is recovering 
this has been reinforced by positive news related to housing and employment that seem to have offset concerns related to the fiscal balance 
even though the united states represents today about of the world demand for refined copper  the recovery of its economy is key to copper demand since the united states is the most important secondary copper consumer  affecting copper demand in other economies 
finally  after a severe  where european demand is estimated to have decreased by approximately  there are signs indicating a copper demand increase of 
it should be mentioned that europe now represents approximately of the world demand for refined copper 
on the supply side  we understand that several structural factors  such as labor stoppages  technical problems and other issues are still affecting copper supply  which we believe will very likely result in weak supply growth in  even though we will see several projects coming into operation by year end or in we believe scc is positioned to take advantage of this unsettled situation  through our investment program of organic growth  aimed at increasing production from our current capacity of  tons to million tons by molybdenum we saw a molybdenum demand growth in  which helped to reduce the surplus of supply to demand from approximately to 
we expect that in the balance between supply and demand will continue reducing the market surplus  thereby improving molybdenum prices in the near future 
silver we believe that silver prices will have strong support due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty 
zinc we also believe that zinc has very good long term fundamentals due to its significant industrial consumption  however  inventories are currently at a relatively high level  which tends to maintain a relatively weak zinc price 
production for  we are currently expecting a copper production of  tons of which approximately  tons would be from third party copper 
we expect molybdenum production in to be about  tons including approximately  tons from our new molybdenum plant at buenavista 
additionaly  in we expect to produce and sell million ounces of silver and produce  tons of zinc 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were a record of  million for  higher than in the increase reflects our strong commitment to the company s expansion programs at buenavista and other properties 
in 
table of contents  million was invested in our buenavista projects 
in we will continue our investment program to increase copper production capacity by approximately by  from  tons to million tons 
scc shareholder derivative lawsuit on october   we received from amc  our majority shareholder  billion in satisfaction of the judgment issued pursuant to the decision of the court of chancery of delaware  which concluded that we paid an excessive price to amc in the merger between the company and minera mexico  sa de sa from the aforementioned sum received from amc  we paid million to the plaintiff s attorneys to satisfy the court ordered award of attorneys fees and expenses 
the effect of these transactions was recorded in our results 
the payment of million attorney s fees was recorded as an operating expense and the receipt of billion was recorded in equity as additional paid in capital 
financing on november   we issued billion of fixed rate unsecured notes with a discount of million  which is being amortized over the term of the related debt 
this debt was issued in two tranches  million due in at an annual interest rate of and billion due in at an annual interest rate of 
net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes  including the financing of our capital expenditure program 
changes in credit risk on december  fitch ratings upgraded the company s unsecured debt ratings from bbb to bbb 
additionally  standard poor s ratings services and moody s investor services aligned and confirmed scc debt rating by assigning bbb and baa  respectively  to the new notes issued 
tantahuatay the tantahuatay mine is located in cajamarca  in northern peru 
production started in august and the mine produced  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver in for  the current plan is to produce  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver 
we hold a interest in this mine 
in  we have recognized million in earnings see caption equity earnings of affiliate  on our statement of earnings for our share of the net income of the mine 
peru labor negotiations we conducted negotiations with eight peruvian unions whose collective bargaining agreements expired in during the first two months of  we have signed three year agreements with all the unions 
the agreements include  among other things  annual salary increases of  and for each of the three years  respectively  for all workers 
there were no strikes during and on december and   the three major unions held a two day illegal work stoppage which did not have a material impact on production 
key matters we discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition 
these matters include i earnings  ii production  iii operating cash costs as a measure of our performance  iv metal prices  v business segments  vi the effect of inflation and other local currency issues  and vii our capital investment and exploration program 
earnings the table below highlights key financial and operational data of our company for the three years ended december  net sales in millions net income attributable to scc in millions earnings per share dividends per share average lme copper price pounds of copper sold in millions prices for copper and all our major by products were lower in and we absorbed a charge of million in for legal fees paid in connection with the scc shareholder derivative litigation 
because of higher production and sales volume of our metals we were able to record good results for  with net earnings of billion 

table of contents production the table below highlights  mine production data of our company for the three years ended december  copper in million pounds molybdenum in million pounds zinc in million pounds silver in million ounces compared with mined copper in increased million pounds  compared to production 
the increase was due to higher production at our mexican mines and includes an additional million pounds at the buenavista mine  which had record production in  million pounds at the la caridad mine  and million pounds of higher production at the cuajone mine 
these increases in production were the result of higher ore grades and recoveries  and were partially offset by lower production at the toquepala mine  whose production decreased by mainly due to lower pls copper grade and volume processed at the sxew plant 
molybdenum production decreased slightly in  compared with  due primarily to million pounds of lower production at the toquepala mine  as a result of lower ore grades and recoveries  offset by million pounds and million pounds of higher production at la caridad mine and cuajone mine  respectively 
zinc mine production  which comes from our immsa unit in mexico  increased by million pounds in  higher than in  mainly as a result of higher recoveries and the production recovery at the santa eulalia mine after the flooding problems of prior years were resolved 
our silver production increased in  principally due to higher production at the buenavista mine and the cuajone mine  offset somewhat by lower production at some of our other mines 
compared with mined copper in increased million pounds or over the production principally due to higher production at our buenavista mine 
the buenavista mine restored full capacity in the second quarter of and increased production by million pounds 
decreases at our peruvian mines of million pounds  largely from lower ore grade at the cuajone mine and a decrease of million pounds at la caridad mine  due to lower grades and recoveries  partially offset the increase from buenavista 
molybdenum production decreased by approximately million pounds in  lower than in  due primarily to million pounds of lower production at the cuajone mine  partially offset by million of higher production at the toquepala mine both due to changes in recoveries  and lower ore grades at cuajone mine 
zinc mine production  which comes from our immsa unit in mexico decreased by million pounds in  lower than in  principally due to no production at the santa eulalia mine  as a result of a flooding caused by heavy rains  and decreases in production at the santa barbara and charcas mines of million pounds mainly due to lower ore grades 
our silver production increased slightly in  principally due to higher production at the buenavista mine mostly offset by lower production at some of our other mines 
operating cash costs an overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced 
operating cash cost is a non gaap measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies 
a reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading  non gaap information reconciliation  on page we have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion  less the cost of purchased concentrates  plus selling  general and administrative charges  treatment and refining charges  net 
table of contents revenue loss on sale of metal purchased from third parties and by product revenues  and sales premiums  less workers participation and other miscellaneous charges  including the peruvian royalty charge  the special mining tax and the change in inventory levels  divided by total pounds of copper produced by our own mines 
in our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced  we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of by products molybdenum  zinc  silver  gold and other minor by products and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales 
we account for the by product revenues in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper 
we believe that our company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company  and is valued  in large part  by the investment community s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost 
we also include copper sales premiums as a credit  as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices 
the increase in recent years in the price of molybdenum  as well as increases in the prices of silver and zinc  have had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods 
accordingly  we present cash costs with and without crediting the by product revenues against our costs 
we exclude the cost of purchases of third party copper material 
from time to time we purchase copper concentrates on the open market in order to maximize the use of our metallurgical facilities or to take advantage of an attractive market situation 
we view these purchases on an incremental basis and measure the results incrementally 
we find that the inclusion of these purchases with our own production often creates a distortion in our unit cost 
accordingly  we include only the net effect of these purchases as a by product credit  so that only the net revenue or loss from the transaction is included in the calculation 
we believe this will allow others to see a truer presentation of our cash cost  which we consider is one of the lowest of copper producing companies of similar size 
we exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation  amortization and depletion  which are considered non cash expenses 
exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded 
workers participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre tax earnings and are also excluded 
additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non recurring nature and the mining royalty charge and special mining tax 
our operating cash costs per pound  as defined  are presented in the table below for the three years ended december  year variance dollars per pound operating cash cost per pound of copper produced without by products revenue add by product revenues operating cash cost per pound of copper produced compared with as seen on the chart above  operating cash cost per pound of copper before by product credits was cents per pound higher than in  an increase of  mainly due to increases in fuel and power cost 
operating cash cost per pound  net of by product credits  was cents per pound higher than in  largely as a result of lower prices for our major by products  which decreased between and in the period 
compared with our cash cost per pound  excluding by product revenues  was higher by cents per pound in  compared with  principally due to higher production cost  mainly power and fuel cost due to increased market prices  labor due to salary increases and repair costs  partially offset by the higher production from the buenavista mine 
our cash cost per pound for when calculated with by product revenues was cents per pound  compared with cents per pound in the increase was due to some cost inflation  mainly fuel and power and lower by product credit largely due to lower molybdenum sales volume and price 
metal prices the profitability of our operations is dependent on  and our financial performance is influenced by  the international market prices for the products we produce  especially for copper  molybdenum  zinc and silver 
metal prices 
table of contents historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors  which affect each commodity to varying degrees  include international economic and political conditions  levels of supply and demand  the availability and cost of substitutes  inventory levels maintained by producers and others and  to a lesser degree  inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates 
in addition  the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short term changes due to financial investments 
we are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices 
assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved  that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs  metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following change in estimated net income attributable to scc resulting from metal price changes copper molybdenum zinc silver change in metal prices per pound except silver per ounce change in net earnings in millions business segments we view our company as having three operating segments and manage it on the basis of these segments 
these segments are our peruvian operations  our mexican open pit operations and our mexican underground operations  known as our immsa unit 
our peruvian operations include the toquepala and cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants  industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines 
the peruvian operations produce copper  with significant by product production of molybdenum  silver and other material 
our mexican open pit operations include la caridad and the buenavista mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants and support facilities  which service both mines 
the mexican open pit operations produce copper  with significant by product production of molybdenum  silver and other material 
our immsa unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc  lead  copper  silver and gold  a coal mine which produces coal and coke  and several industrial processing facilities for zinc  copper and silver 
segment information is included in our review of results of operations and also in note segment and related information of our consolidated financial statements 
inflation and exchange rate effect of the peruvian nuevo sol and the mexican peso our functional currency is the us dollar 
portions of our operating costs are denominated in peruvian nuevos soles and mexican pesos 
since our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars  when inflation deflation in peru or mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso  respectively  to the dollar  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation exchange rate effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments 
in addition  the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by exchange rate variances of the nuevo sol or the peso  resulting in a re measurement gain or loss in our financial statements

in  we will continue our investment program aimed at increasing copper production capacity by approximately from  tons to million tons by we have budgeted billion in spending for the year 
spending in mexico is estimated to be billion  including approximately billion for our buenavista projects  and billion in peru 
these investments are part of our five year capital investment program to increase production of copper and molybdenum 
capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in the economy or market conditions 
we expect to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand  internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required 
peruvian operations toquepala projects through december   we have spent million on the toquepala projects 
these expenses include mine equipment used for the initial stripping of the mine expansion  the initial construction work and planning to build a new crusher and a conveyor belt system to replace rail hauling and other costs 
the expenses are designed to allow for future savings 
the projects include the increase in milling capacity of the toquepala concentrator from  tons per day to  tons  which should increase annual production by  tons of copper and  tons of molybdenum 
as a result of protests from some community groups the approval process for the eia of this project has been delayed 
these groups raised concerns related to water usage and pollution 
as a result of these issues the peruvian government has started discussions with the local communities and the regional authorities to resolve this impasse 
on february   we reached a final agreement with the province of candarave  one of the three provinces neighboring our toquepala unit  which commits us to funding s 
million approximately million for development projects in the province 
this agreement is contingent upon receiving approval for the project 
we expect to continue working with the candarave province and the other two provinces neighboring toquepala to resolve all open issues during assuming we receive approval of the eia on a timely basis  project completion is scheduled for the first half of 
table of contents cuajone projects through december   we have spent million on two projects related to this unit s production plans the variable cut off ore grade project and the hpgr project 
current production is showing the initial benefits of the variable cut off project 
we expect that both projects will be at full capacity by the second half of when finished  the project will increase average copper production by  tons per year 
tailings disposal at quebrada honda this project increases the height of the existing quebrada honda dam to impound future tailings from the toquepala and cuajone mills and will extend the expected life of this tailings facility by years
