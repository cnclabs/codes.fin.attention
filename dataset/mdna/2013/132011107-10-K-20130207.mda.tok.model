item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview the company s business consists of three manufacturing facilities and one biocatalysis center 
these facilities primarily manufacture apis  pharmaceutical intermediates and  to a lesser extent  other fine chemicals 
the company also owns a stake in zenara  a pharmaceutical company with final dosage form manufacturing capabilities based in india 
the following significant events  which are explained in detail on the following pages  occurred during gross sales in increased to  from  in foreign currency exchange unfavorably impacted sales 
operating profit increased to  from debt  net of cash  decreased  during release of a valuation allowance on domestic deferred tax assets of gross sales in of  were  or higher than excluding foreign currency  sales increased as a result of higher volumes sold partially offset by lower pricing 
sales volumes increased in most of the company s product categories including controlled substances  generic apis  custom development and products utilizing the company s drug delivery technology 
these increases were partially offset by lower pricing for controlled substances and products utilizing the company s drug delivery technology 
the company also experienced a modest increase in its custom manufacturing product category 
this category includes apis  pharmaceutical intermediates and other pharmaceutical products sold to innovator pharmaceutical companies 
increased demand for certain apis was partially offset by a newly approved product in which the customer built up inventory in gross margins in increased to compared to in gross margins included a favorable impact from foreign currency versus excluding the foreign currency impact  gross margins were positively impacted by higher production volumes  leading to increased plant efficiency  and favorable product mix  partially offset by lower pricing in which eroded margins the company reported income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share in  compared to  or per diluted share in the increase in includes a tax benefit of  or per diluted share  resulting from the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and higher gross profit resulting from increased sales 
critical accounting estimates the company s critical accounting estimates are those that require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows dollars in thousands  except per share data 
index revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
amounts billed in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
since payments received are typically non refundable  the termination of a contract by a customer prior to its completion could result in an immediate recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments already received but not previously recognized as revenue 
sales terms to certain customers include rebates if certain conditions are met 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates and returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs which are classified as allowances and rebates 
the company bills a portion of freight cost incurred on shipments to customers 
amounts billed to customers are recorded within net revenues 
freight costs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments the review of long lived assets  principally fixed assets and other amortizable intangibles  requires the company to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows generated from these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying value  the long lived assets are written down to fair value 
the review of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is conducted annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable utilizing a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model and compared to the carrying value 
if such analysis indicates that impairment may exist  the company then estimates the fair value of the other assets and liabilities utilizing appraisals and discounted cash flow analyses to calculate an impairment charge 
the company has investments in partially owned affiliates 
it does not separately test an investee s underlying assets for impairment but will recognize its share of any impairment charge recorded by an investee in earnings and consider the effect of the impairment on its investment 
a series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of the investment has occurred that is other than temporary 
a loss in value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline would be recognized as an impairment if the fair value of that investment is less than its carrying amount 
the determination of fair value is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows primarily based on operating plans  discount rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and perpetual growth rates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge

index income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and tax credit carryforwards  on a taxing jurisdiction basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse or the tax credit carryforwards are expected to be realized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxable years will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdictions to utilize the deferred tax assets 
when the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is recorded 
after release of a portion of the company s domestic valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of  the remaining domestic valuation allowance primarily relates to federal foreign tax credits 
prior to  domestic valuation allowances also included alternative minimum tax credits  research and development tax credits and other net deferred tax balances  excluding deferred tax liabilities on indefinite lived intangibles 
the company s foreign valuation allowances primarily relate to nol carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income or where future profitability is uncertain 
the company s accounting for deferred taxes represents management s best estimate of those future events 
changes in current estimates  due to unanticipated events  could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
assumptions and approach used in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company records a valuation allowance against all or a portion of the deferred tax assets to adjust the balance to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified 
this assessment  which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis  takes into account a number of types of evidence  including the following nature  frequency  and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses 
a pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence 
the company generally considers cumulative pre tax losses in the current three year period to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability 
the company also considers the strength and trend of earnings  as well as other relevant factors 
in certain circumstances  historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in the company s business operations  sources of future taxable income 
future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable evidence 
projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated  and tax planning strategies 
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented to maximize utilization of expiring tax credit carryforwards are evaluated as a source of additional positive evidence 
valuation allowance assessment in  the company s assessment of the need for a valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets considered current and past performance  cumulative losses in recent years from domestic operations  and a shift in the geographic mix of forecasted income 
considering the pattern of then recent domestic losses  the company gave significant weight to projections showing future domestic losses for purposes of assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
this assessment resulted in a determination that it was more likely than not that domestic deferred tax assets would not be realized  and as such  a valuation allowance against net domestic deferred tax assets was recorded 
a sustained period of domestic profitability along with expectations of future domestic profitability of sufficient amounts and character is required before the company would change its judgment regarding the need for a full valuation allowance against net domestic deferred tax assets 
during  the company noted that it continued to approach three year cumulative profitability and that it was possible it would conclude by the end of the year that a portion of its domestic deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be reversed in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its long range planning process and all necessary analyses and concluded that its three year cumulative domestic profitability through the end of and expectations of future domestic profitability warranted the reversal of all of the domestic valuation allowance attributable to net federal temporary differences  alternative minimum tax credits  and research and experimentation tax credits 
additionally  the company released a portion of the domestic valuation allowance attributable to federal foreign tax credits 
these valuation allowance releases resulted in a tax benefit to continuing operations of  dollars in thousands  except per share data 
index environmental and litigation contingencies the company periodically assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and its position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that the company will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
if probable and estimable  the company accrues for the costs of clean up  settlements and legal fees 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that the company may have made with respect to their resolution from time to time 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees  including pensions and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  turnover rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are reasonable 
the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is selected by projecting cash flows associated with plan obligations which are matched to a yield curve of high quality bonds 
the company then selects the single rate that produces the same present value as if each cash flow were discounted by the corresponding spot rate on the yield curve 
results of operations compared to gross sales in increased to  from  in foreign currency exchange unfavorably impacted sales 
excluding foreign currency  sales volumes increased in most of the company s product categories including controlled substances  generic apis  custom development and products utilizing the company s drug delivery technology 
these increases were partially offset by lower pricing for controlled substances and products utilizing the company s drug delivery technology 
the company also experienced a modest increase in its custom manufacturing product category 
this category primarily includes apis and pharmaceutical intermediates sold to innovator pharmaceutical companies 
increased demand for certain apis was partially offset by a newly approved product in which the customer built up inventory in one customer  gyma  a distributor representing multiple customers  accounted for of the company s consolidated sales

the first court date for the larger of the two assessments was held in september  and the company has not yet received the court s ruling 
in the company increased its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for this matter by  including of foreign currency translation  primarily due to a change in the potential penalties that could be levied against the company 
the company still believes this dispute to be in the early stages of the judicial process since any ruling reached by any of the courts may be subject to further appeals  and as such the final date of resolution of this matter is uncertain at this time 
however  within the next twelve months it is possible that factors such as new developments  settlements or judgments may require the company to increase its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits by up to approximately  or decrease its reserve by approximately  including penalties and interest 
if the court rules against the company in subsequent court proceedings  a payment for a substantial portion of the judgment  including any penalties and interest  will be due immediately while the case is appealed 
the company has analyzed these issues in accordance with guidance on uncertain tax positions and believes at this time that its reserves are adequate  and intends to vigorously defend itself

contingencies the company is subject to various investigations  claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities 
the company continually assesses all known facts and circumstances as they pertain to all legal and environmental matters and evaluates the need for reserves and disclosures as deemed necessary based on these facts and circumstances 
these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  could result in actual costs that are significantly higher than the company s current assessment and could have a material adverse effect on the company operating results and cash flows in future reporting periods 
while these matters  specifically environmental matters  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  based upon past experience  it is likely that payments significantly in excess of current reserves  if required  would be made over an extended number of years 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company and its subsidiaries are a party to several environmental proceedings and remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  have been named a prp for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
additionally  the company has retained the liability for certain environmental proceedings associated with discontinued operations 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters where remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
such liabilities are based on the company s best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the resolution of such matters often spans several years and frequently involves regulatory oversight or adjudication 
additionally  many remediation requirements are fluid and are likely to be affected by future technological  site and regulatory developments 
consequently  the ultimate liability with respect to such matters  as well as the timing of cash disbursements cannot be determined with certainty

scientific chemical processing scp superfund site nepera was named a prp of the scp superfund site  located in carlstadt  new jersey  in the early s along with approximately other prps 
the site is a former waste processing facility that accepted various waste for recovery and disposal including processing wastewater from nepera 
the prps are in the process of implementing a final remedy at the site 
the scp superfund site has also been identified as a prp in the berry s creek superfund site see previous discussion 
for over a decade  the remediation has been funded by de minimus settlements and by the insurers of the scp superfund site s owners and operators 
however  due to an unexpected increase in remediation costs at the site and costs to contribute to the berry s creek investigation  the prp group has approved the assessment of an additional cash contribution by the prp group 
while the company continues to dispute the methodology used by the prp group to arrive at its allocation for the cash contribution  the company has paid the initial funding requests 
the company does not currently maintain a reserve for the scp superfund site 
costs associated with remediation at the site  and scp s current allocation of berry s creek investigative costs are each expected to be communicated to the company by scp in newark bay complex litigation caschem and cosan have been named as two of several hundred third party defendants in a third party complaint filed in february  by maxus energy corporation maxus and tierra solutions  inc tierra
