industry consolidation our industry remains fragmented with few companies possessing a significant share in any particular market  which allows some participants to continue consolidating specialty  regional and niche players in the industry 
the company plans to continue to explore opportunities to enhance sales growth and increase its market presence through strategic acquisitions  as evidenced by the recent acquisitions of bioreliance and research organics 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations since we are a multinational corporation that sells and sources products in many different currencies  changes in exchange rates have in the past  and could in the future  adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
due to the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results 
emerging market growth with the emerging markets in the apla region growing at faster rates  we continue to focus our sales efforts on this region and achieved an increase in organic net sales of percent compared to the prior year 
the company further expanded its footprint in this region with the openings of a new manufacturing facility in kaohsiung  taiwan  that serves the fast growing led market  an expanded distribution center and new packaging facility in bangalore  india  and a new packaging and quality control facility in wuxi  china

highlights of our consolidated results for the year ended december   are as follows sales were  an increase of percent compared to the same period last year 
excluding the sales from acquisitions  which increased sales by percent  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which lowered sales by percent  sales increased organically by percent year over year 
gross profit margin was percent  down from percent in primarily as a result of the impact of acquisitions and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
operating income margin was percent  compared to percent in this decline was largely attributable to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of amortization related to recent acquisitions 
restructuring costs and acquisition transaction costs also lowered the operating income margin in lower sg a as a percentage of sales partially offset these impacts 
diluted net income per share was  compared to in during  unfavorable currency impacts of were overcome by higher sales levels and cost reduction initiatives  resulting in a percent increase in diluted net income per share over prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was  an increase of from last year

non gaap financial measures the company supplements its disclosures made in accordance with gaap with certain non gaap financial measures 
the company does not  and does not suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  gaap financial information 
these non gaap measures may not be consistent with the presentation by similar companies in the company industry 
whenever the company uses such non gaap measures  it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable gaap measure 

table of contents with over percent of sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  management uses currency adjusted growth  and believes it is useful to investors  to judge the company local currency performance 
organic sales growth data presented herein excludes currency impacts  and where indicated  acquisition impacts 
the company calculates the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by multiplying current period activity by the difference between current period exchange rates and prior period exchange rates  the result is the defined impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or changes in fx 
while we are able to report currency impacts after the fact  we are unable to estimate changes that may occur in to applicable exchange rates 
any significant changes in currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on our reported growth rates due to the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies 
management also uses free cash flow  a non gaap measure  to judge its performance and ability to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
management believes this non gaap information is useful to investors as well 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventories on hand and records a provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory  inventory not meeting quality standards and inventory subject to expiration 
the provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory is based on current estimates of future product demand  market conditions and related management judgment 
any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions that vary from current expectations could have an impact on the value of inventories 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  including intangibles with definite lives  are amortized over their expected useful lives 
goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized against earnings 
goodwill is assessed annually for impairment 
all long lived assets are assessed whenever events and changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if impairment is indicated  the asset value is written down to its fair market value 
any significant unanticipated changes in business or market conditions that vary from current expectations could have an impact on the fair value of these assets and a potential associated impairment 
there were no indications of impairment as of december  pension and other post retirement benefits 
the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the company selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries to calculate such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note pension and post retirement benefit plans to the company consolidated financial statements in
