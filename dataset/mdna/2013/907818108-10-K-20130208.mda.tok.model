item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item  and other information in this report  including risk factors set forth in item a and critical accounting policies and cautionary information at the end of this item the railroad  along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates  is our one reportable business segment 
although revenue is analyzed by commodity  we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network 
executive summary results safety our employee safety results continued to improve in the employee injury incident rate per  employee hours declined from  to a new record low 
these results reflect employee training  the move to standard work  and extensive efforts to identify and eliminate risk 
our use of technologies such as laser  ultrasound  and acoustic vibration monitoring  which help identify potential rail  wheel and axle failures before they occur contributed to the reduction of our equipment incident rate to per million train miles  another best ever result 
with respect to public safety  we closed grade crossings in to reduce our exposure to incidents and continued use of video cameras on our locomotives to analyze public safety incidents 
we now have camera equipped locomotives in the lead position on over of our through freight trains 
despite our efforts during  the rate of grade crossing incidents per million train miles increased from overall  our safety results reflect our structured approach to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees  our customers and the public 
financial performance we produced another record setting year in  generating operating income of billion  an increase over despite flat volume  core pricing gains of and higher fuel surcharge recoveries more than offset inflation and higher depreciation expense to drive the increase 
our operating ratio for of was an all time best  improving from last year s operating ratio of 
net income of billion surpassed our previous milestone set in  translating into earnings of per diluted share for freight revenues our freight revenues grew year over year to billion 
freight revenues for four of the six commodity groups increased despite flat volume 
volume declines in coal and agricultural products offset double digit volume increases in automotive and chemicals 
core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharges drove the growth in freight revenue in compared to fuel surcharges increased due to higher fuel prices  the lag effect of our programs surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months and new fuel surcharge provisions in renegotiated contracts 
network operations in  our business mix changed significantly both geographically and by commodity 
nevertheless  by adjusting resources to match market and network requirements  we continued operating an efficient and fluid network 
as reported to the association of american railroads aar  average train speed increased in compared to  reflecting more efficient operations and relatively mild weather conditions compared to  which included severe winter weather  flooding  and extreme heat and drought that affected various parts of our network during the year 
average terminal dwell time remained flat despite a shift in business mix to more manifest traffic  which requires more switching  resulting in more terminal dwell time 
average rail car inventory decreased slightly  reflecting productivity improvements and ongoing initiatives designed to reduce the number of cars in our fleet 
these operational improvements resulted in a record customer satisfaction index in fuel prices despite consistent average crude oil barrel prices in and  our price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed increased due to higher crude oil to diesel conversion spreads 
the higher spreads increased operating expenses by million excluding any impact from year over year volume 
a decline in gross ton miles partially offset the higher expenses 
our fuel consumption rate did not change in from the rate in 
table of contents free cash flow cash generated by operating activities totaled billion  reduced by billion for cash used in investing activities and a increase in dividends paid  yielding free cash flow of billion 
free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the reclassification of our receivables securitization facility  less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid 
free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap by sec regulation g and item of sec regulation s k and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
we believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure millions cash provided by operating activities receivables securitization facility

effective january   a new accounting standard required us to account for receivables transferred under our receivables securitization facility as secured borrowings in our consolidated statements of financial position and as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the receivables securitization facility is included in our free cash flow calculation to adjust cash provided by operating activities as though our receivables securitization facility had been accounted for under the new accounting standard for all periods presented 
outlook safety operating a safe railroad benefits our employees  our customers  our shareholders  and the communities we serve 
we will continue using a multi faceted approach to safety  utilizing technology  risk assessment  quality control  training and employee engagement  and targeted capital investments 
we will continue using and expanding the deployment of total safety culture throughout our operations  which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety 
derailment prevention and the reduction of grade crossing incidents are critical aspects of our safety programs 
we will continue our efforts to increase rail defect detection  improve or close crossings  and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs including risk assessment strategies  various industry programs and local community activities across our network 
network operations we will continue focusing on our six critical initiatives to improve safety  service and productivity during we are seeing solid contributions from reducing variability  continuous improvements  and standard work 
resource agility allows us to respond quickly to changing market conditions and network disruptions from weather or other events 
the railroad continues to benefit from capital investments that allow us to build capacity for growth and harden our infrastructure to reduce failure 
fuel prices uncertainty about the economy makes projections of fuel prices difficult 
we again could see volatile fuel prices during the year  as they are sensitive to global and us domestic demand  refining capacity  geopolitical events  weather conditions and other factors 
to reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings  we will continue seeking cost recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expanding our fuel conservation efforts 
capital plan in  we plan to make total capital investments of approximately billion  including expenditures for positive train control ptc  which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments 
see further discussion in this item under liquidity and capital resources capital plan 

table of contents positive train control in response to a legislative mandate to implement ptc  we expect to spend approximately million during on developing and deploying ptc 
we currently estimate that ptc  in accordance with implementing rules issued by the federal rail administration fra  will cost us approximately billion by the end of the project 
this includes costs for installing the new system along our tracks  upgrading locomotives to work with the new system  and adding digital data communication equipment to integrate the components of the system 
financial expectations we are cautious about the economic environment but if industrial production grows approximately as projected  volume should exceed levels 
even with no volume growth  we expect earnings to exceed earnings  generated by real core pricing gains  on going network improvements and operational productivity initiatives 
we also expect that a new bonus depreciation program under federal tax laws will positively impact cash flows in results of operations operating revenues millions change v change v freight revenues other revenues total we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups 
freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc 
changes in price  traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc 
we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations  which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments 
we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination 
we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 
other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries  revenues from our commuter rail operations  and accessorial revenues  which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage 
we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 
freight revenues from four of our six commodity groups increased during compared to revenues from coal and agricultural products declined during the year 
our franchise diversity allowed us to take advantage of growth from shale related markets crude oil  frac sand and pipe and strong automotive manufacturing  which offset volume declines from coal and agricultural products 
arc increased  driven by core pricing gains and higher fuel cost recoveries 
improved fuel recovery provisions and higher fuel prices  including the lag effect of our programs surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months  combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges 
freight revenues for all six commodity groups increased during compared to  while volume increased in all commodity groups except intermodal 
increased demand in many market sectors  with particularly strong growth in chemicals  industrial products  and automotive shipments for the year  generated the increases 
arc increased  driven by higher fuel cost recoveries and core pricing gains 
fuel cost recoveries include fuel surcharge revenue and the impact of resetting the base fuel price for certain traffic 
higher fuel prices  volume growth  and new fuel surcharge provisions in renegotiated contracts all combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges 
our fuel surcharge programs excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated freight revenues of billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
ongoing rising fuel prices and increased fuel surcharge coverage drove the increases 
additionally  fuel surcharge revenue is not entirely comparable to prior periods as we continue to convert portions of our non regulated traffic to mileage based fuel surcharge programs

table of contents agricultural products lower volume more than offset core pricing gains and increased fuel surcharges as agricultural freight revenue decreased in versus weak export demand for us wheat drove a decrease in wheat shipments year over year  as the foreign wheat market improved significantly from the weather affected crop in in addition  corn shipments declined for the year  with more significant declines in the fourth quarter  reflecting the impact of the severe drought across the us lower gasoline demand  reduced exports and higher corn prices decreased ethanol shipments during the second half of the year 
growth in imported beer from mexico and a strong domestic harvest of fresh potatoes partially offset these declines 
agricultural carloads logo fuel surcharges  price improvements and modest volume growth increased agricultural freight revenue in versus the federal mandate for higher levels of ethanol in the nation s fuel supply and new business increased shipments of ethanol by in versus strong export demand for us wheat via gulf ports in the first half of was the primary driver of a increase in wheat and food grains shipments for compared to  despite a decrease in shipments in the second half of when us grain exports declined 
poor wheat production in some foreign markets drove the export demand during the first six months of the year 
automotive increased shipments of finished vehicles and automotive parts along with core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharges improved automotive freight revenue from levels 
higher production and sales levels drove the volume growth 
in addition  shipments compared favorably to due to lower shipments of international vehicles in following the disaster in japan 
higher volume  core pricing gains and fuel surcharges improved automotive freight revenue in  from levels 
although higher production and sales levels during contributed to volume growth  the disaster in japan partially offset the increase in shipments 
the disruption caused by this event reduced parts shipments in the second quarter and shipments of international vehicles in the second and third quarters 
finished autos shipments were up in from  aided by a increase in the fourth quarter as the us light vehicle sales rate was the highest since the second quarter of automotive carloads logo chemicals higher volume  core price improvements and fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from chemicals in shipments of crude oil primarily from the bakken  permian and eagle ford shale formations to the gulf area increased over three fold  driving the improvement in chemicals shipments 
in addition  plastics and industrial chemicals shipments increased as low natural gas prices have made us chemicals more cost competitive globally 
declines in potash due to temporary shutdowns and reduced production at several mines partially offset the increases in chemical shipments during the year 
chemicals carloads logo 
table of contents volume gains  fuel surcharges and price improvements increased freight revenue from chemicals in versus in mid  we began moving crude oil shipments from the bakken formation in north dakota to facilities in louisiana 
this new business  along with shipments from the eagle ford shale formation in south texas  contributed to a increase in shipments of petroleum products during strong domestic demand and robust spring planting increased fertilizer shipments by versus additionally  improving market conditions increased demand for industrial chemicals during  driving volume levels up versus coal lower volume  partially offset by core pricing gains and fuel surcharge recoveries reduced freight revenue from coal shipments in compared to shipments of coal from the southern powder river basin sprb mines decreased from above average coal stockpiles due to an unseasonably warm winter and low natural gas prices  which caused some displacement of coal in electricity production  led to the volume declines 
in addition  the loss of two contracts to a competitor contributed to lower volumes from the sprb 
coal shipments from the colorado and utah mines increased versus increased export shipments of colorado and utah coal in offset the domestic declines due to higher stockpiles and low natural gas prices 
coal carloads logo core pricing gains  higher fuel surcharges  and increased volume grew coal freight revenue in versus levels 
shipments of coal from the sprb were up in compared to  reflecting new business to wisconsin facilities and the start up of a new power plant near waco  texas 
completion of a year long equipment relocation process at one of the mines in the third quarter of and minimal production problems elsewhere improved shipments from colorado and utah by in versus these gains  along with increased exports to europe and asia  offset first half production problems and weak demand from eastern coal utilities 
industrial products core pricing improvement  higher volume and additional fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from industrial products in versus shipments of non metallic minerals primarily frac sand  grew in response to increased horizontal drilling activity for energy products 
more construction activity during a relatively mild winter led to higher demand for shipments of lumber  cement and stone compared to the growth in housing starts throughout also increased lumber shipments  up from steel shipments finished slightly down from levels as lower demand for export scrap and mine production issues in the second half of the year offset increases in the first half due to higher demand for steel coils and plate for pipe and auto production 
industrial products carloads logo increased volume  fuel surcharges  and core pricing improvement increased freight revenue from industrial products in versus shipments of non metallic minerals primarily frac sand grew in response to a dramatic rise in horizontal drilling activity for natural gas and oil  while steel shipments increased due to higher demand for steel coils and plate for automotive and pipe production 
in addition  an increase in iron ore export business to china also drove volume growth 
conversely  lower commercial construction activity reduced stone  sand and gravel shipments in compared to 
table of contents intermodal higher fuel surcharges  including improved fuel recovery provisions  core pricing gains and volume growth increased freight revenue from intermodal shipments in volume levels from international traffic remained flat year over year as the loss of a customer contract in the first half of the year offset modest west coast import growth 
domestic traffic increased versus due to better market conditions and continued conversion of traffic from truck to rail 
fuel surcharge gains  including better contract provisions for fuel cost recovery  and pricing improvements  partially offset by lower volume  increased freight revenue from intermodal shipments in compared to volume from international traffic decreased in versus  intermodal carloads logo driven by softer economic conditions  reflected in a muted international peak shipping season  which usually starts in the third quarter  and the loss of a customer contract 
conversely  conversions from truck to rail and recovering consumer demand offset competition for domestic shipments  resulting in a volume increase in domestic shipments during mexico business each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico 
revenue from mexico business increased to billion in versus volume levels for four of the six commodity groups industrial products and agricultural products declined  were up in aggregate versus  with particularly strong growth in automotive and intermodal shipments 
revenue from mexico business increased to billion in versus volume levels increased in aggregate versus  with particularly strong growth in automotive and industrial products 
coal was the one commodity group that declined as one of our customers conducted a supplier contract renewal during the year  shifting transportation modes from rail to truck during the process

operating expenses increased billion in versus our fuel price per gallon rose during  accounting for million of the increase 
wage and benefit inflation  volume related costs  depreciation  and property taxes also contributed to higher expenses 
expenses increased million for costs related to the flooding in the midwest and million due to the impact of severe heat and operating expenses logo drought in the south  primarily texas 
cost savings from productivity improvements and better resource utilization partially offset these increases 
a million one time payment relating to a transaction with csx intermodal  inc csxi increased operating expenses during the first quarter of  which favorably affects the comparison of operating expenses in to those in compensation and benefits compensation and benefits include wages  payroll taxes  health and welfare costs  pension costs  other postretirement benefits  and incentive costs

expenses for contract services increased million in versus  primarily due to increased demand for transportation services purchased by our logistics subsidiaries for their customers and additional costs for repair and maintenance of locomotives and freight cars 
expenses for contract services increased million in versus  driven by volume related external transportation services incurred by our subsidiaries  and various other types of contractual services  including flood related repairs  mitigation and improvements 
volume related crew transportation and lodging costs  as well as expenses associated with jointly owned operating facilities  also increased costs compared to in addition  an increase in locomotive maintenance materials used to prepare a portion of our locomotive fleet for return to active service due to increased volume and additional capacity for weather related issues and warranty expirations increased expenses in depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to road property  including rail  ties  ballast  and other track material 
a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting ongoing capital spending  increased depreciation expense in compared to a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting ongoing capital spending  increased depreciation expense in compared to higher depreciation rates for rail and other track material also contributed to the increase 
the higher rates  which became effective january   resulted primarily from increased track usage based on higher gross ton miles in 
equipment and other rents equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal  and locomotive leases  and office and other rent expenses 
increased automotive and intermodal shipments  partially offset by improved car cycle times  drove an increase in our short term freight car rental expense in conversely  lower locomotive lease expense partially offset the higher freight car rental expense 
costs increased in versus as higher short term freight car rental expense and container lease expense offset lower freight car and locomotive lease expense 
other other expenses include personal injury  freight and property damage  destruction of equipment  insurance  environmental  bad debt  state and local taxes  utilities  telephone and cellular  employee travel  computer software  and other general expenses 
other costs in were slightly higher than primarily due to higher property taxes 
despite continual improvement in our safety experience and lower estimated annual costs  personal injury expense increased in compared to  as the liability reduction resulting from historical claim experience was less than the reduction in higher property taxes  casualty costs associated with destroyed equipment  damaged freight and property and environmental costs increased other costs in compared to a one time payment of million in the first quarter of related to a transaction with csxi and continued improvement in our safety performance and lower estimated liability for personal injury  which reduced our personal injury expense year over year  partially offset increases in other costs

average train speed  as reported to the association of american railroads aar  increased in versus efficient operations and relatively mild weather conditions during the year compared favorably to  during which severe winter weather  flooding  and extreme heat and drought affected various parts of our network 
we continued operating a fluid and efficient network while handling essentially the same volume and adjusting operations to accommodate increased capital project work on our network compared to the extreme weather challenges in addition to increased carloadings and traffic mix changes  led to a decrease in average train speed in compared to average terminal dwell time average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals 
lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service 
average terminal dwell time remained flat in compared to  despite a shift in traffic mix to more manifest shipments  which require more switching at terminals 
average terminal dwell time increased in compared to additional volume  weather challenges  track replacement programs  and a shift of traffic mix to more manifest shipments  which require additional terminal processing  all contributed to the increase 
average rail car inventory average rail car inventory is the daily average number of rail cars on our lines  including rail cars in storage 
lower average rail car inventory reduces congestion in our yards and sidings  which increases train speed  reduces average terminal dwell time  and improves rail car utilization 
despite a shift in traffic mix from coal to shale related and automotive shipments with longer

gross and revenue ton miles gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled 
revenue ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles 
gross ton miles declined in compared to  while revenue ton miles decreased and carloads remained relatively flat 
changes in commodity mix drove the year over year variances between gross ton miles  revenue ton miles and carloads 
gross and revenue ton miles increased in compared to  driven by a increase in carloads and mix changes to heavier commodity groups  notably a increase in coal shipments

employees employee levels increased in versus work related to the increase in capital investment  including positive train control  accounted for over half of the increase 
additionally  the shift in our traffic mix required more resources in the southern region to support the growth in shale related shipments 
employee levels were up in versus  driven by a increase in volume levels  a higher number of trainmen  engineers  and yard employees receiving training during the year  and increased work on capital projects 
customer satisfaction index our customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last months on a variety of attributes

the tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital 
our december  debt to capital ratios decreased as a result of a billion increase in equity from december   driven by higher earnings 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  our receivables securitization facility  and our revolving credit facility  as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
we had billion of committed credit available under our credit facility  with no borrowings outstanding as of december  we did not make any borrowings under this facility during the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the million capacity receivables securitization facility was million as of december   and is included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year 
the receivables securitization facility obligates us to maintain an investment grade bond rating 
if our bond rating were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions 
deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity 
access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 
we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities i increasing the utilization of our receivables securitization  ii issuing commercial paper  iii entering into bank loans  outside of our revolving credit facility  or iv issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets 
the company s billion revolving credit facility is intended to back union pacific s ability to issue commercial paper and is an emergency back up source of liquidity 
the company has no current intentions of borrowing under this facility 

table of contents at december  and  we had a working capital surplus 
this reflects a strong cash position  which provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment 
in addition  we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements  and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 
cash flows millions cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities higher net income in increased cash provided by operating activities compared to  partially offset by lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation as explained below and payments for past wages based on national labor negotiations settled earlier this year 
higher net income and lower cash income tax payments in increased cash provided by operating activities compared to the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of provided for bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during  and bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during as a result of the act  the company deferred a substantial portion of its income tax expense 
this deferral decreased income tax payments  thereby contributing to the positive operating cash flow 
in future years  however  additional cash will be used to pay income taxes that were previously deferred 
in addition  the adoption of a new accounting standard in january of changed the accounting treatment for our receivables securitization facility from a sale of undivided interests recorded as an operating activity to a secured borrowing recorded as a financing activity  which decreased cash provided by operating activities by million in investing activities higher capital investments in drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to included in capital investments in was million for the early buyout of locomotives under long term operating and capital leases during the first quarter of  which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions

we expect to use over of our capital investments to replace and improve existing capital assets 
among our major investment categories are replacing and improving track infrastructure  upgrading our locomotive and freight car fleet  including acquisition of locomotives and freight cars  primarily large covered hoppers  gondolas  auto racks and refrigerated box cars  improving technology  including investing in ptc  and other capital projects 
additionally  we will continue increasing our network and terminal capacity  for example  to balance terminal capacity with more mainline capacity from our track expansion in the southern region  we are constructing a rail facility at santa teresa  new mexico  that initially will include a run through and fueling facility and an intermodal ramp 
we expect to fund our cash capital investments by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  and cash on hand 
our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long term strategic plan  which we expect will enhance the long term value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations  ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track  and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long term growth 
financing activities cash used in financing activities increased in versus dividend payments increased by million  reflecting our higher dividend rate  and common stock repurchases increased by million 
our debt levels did not materially change from last year after a decline in debt levels from therefore  less cash was used in for debt activity than in cash used in financing activities increased in versus higher dividend payments in of million compared to million in  reflecting our increased dividend rate and the repurchase of billion of our common stock  a million increase from repurchases  drove the increase 
we used less cash to reduce outstanding debt in  which partially offset this increase 

table of contents credit facilities on december   we had billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility  which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper 
we did not draw on the facility during commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated  investment grade borrowers 
the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates  plus a spread  depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings 
the facility matures in under a four year term and requires the corporation to maintain a debt to net worth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing 
at december   and december  and at all times during the year  we were in compliance with this covenant 
the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt to net worth coverage ratio includes  among other things  certain credit arrangements  capital leases  guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa 
at december   the debt to net worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to billion of debt as defined in the facility  and we had billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date 
under our current capital plans  we expect to continue to satisfy the debt to net worth coverage ratio  however  many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future 
the facility does not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers other than rating dependent pricing  or any other provision that could require us to post collateral 
the facility also includes a million cross default provision and a change of control provision 
during  we issued and repaid commercial paper of million 
at december  and  we had no commercial paper outstanding 
our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances  and  unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program  our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the facility 
at december  and  we reclassified as long term debt million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance 
this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any short term borrowings and certain current maturities of long term debt on a long term basis 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each of the years ended december    and  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was   and  respectively 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations  less equity earnings net of distributions  plus fixed charges and income taxes 
fixed charges represent interest charges  amortization of debt discount  and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges 
see exhibit to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 
common shareholders equity dividend restrictions our revolving credit facility includes a debt to net worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that  under certain circumstances  restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders 
the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 

table of contents share repurchase program effective april   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares of our common stock by march   replacing our previous repurchase program 
as of december   we repurchased a total of billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs 
the table below represents shares repurchased under the new repurchase program  except for the first quarter of which represent shares repurchased under the previous program 
number of shares purchased average price paid first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total remaining number of shares that may be repurchased under current authority management s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases 
we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  debt issuances  and cash on hand 
repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost  which includes any applicable commissions and fees 
shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings under our current shelf registration  we may issue  from time to time  any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 
we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities  however  we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration  and  therefore  we may issue additional debt securities at any time 
during  we issued the following unsecured  fixed rate debt securities under our current shelf registration date description of securities june  million of notes due january  million of notes due june  we used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program 
these debt securities include change of control provisions 
at december   we had remaining authority to issue up to billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 
on may   we borrowed million under a year term loan the loan 
the loan has a floating rate based on london interbank offered rates  plus a spread  and is prepayable in whole or in part without a premium prior to maturity 
the agreement documenting the loan has provisions similar to our revolving credit facility  including identical debt to net worth covenant and change of control provisions and similar customary default provisions 
the agreement does not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers  or any other provision that would require us to post collateral 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we acquired locomotives by exercising early buy out rights in certain operating and capital lease agreements 
following the acquisition of the locomotives  we sold them to financing parties and entered into capital lease financing agreements with these parties 
we did not recognize any gains or losses as a result of these transactions 
capital lease obligations totaling million are reported in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt at december  
table of contents debt exchange on june   we exchanged million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between and existing notes for million of notes new notes due july   plus cash consideration of approximately million and million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes 
in accordance with the accounting standards codification asc  debt modifications and extinguishments derecognition  this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange  as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different 
the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt  and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the new notes 
no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange 
costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately million and were included in interest expense during the three months ended june  the following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged millions principal amount exchanged notes due notes due notes due notes due notes due notes due debentures due notes due total debt redemptions on november   we redeemed all million of our outstanding notes due january  the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of million 
on april   we redeemed all million of our outstanding tooele county  utah hazardous waste treatment revenue bonds due november  the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of million in the second quarter of on december   we redeemed the remaining million of our notes due april   and all million of our outstanding notes due january  the redemptions resulted in an early extinguishment charge of million 
on march   we redeemed million of our notes due april  the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of million in the first quarter of on november   we redeemed all million of our outstanding notes due january  the redemption resulted in a million early extinguishment charge 
receivables securitization facility under the receivables securitization facility  the railroad sells most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables  inc upri  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
upri may subsequently transfer  without recourse on a day revolving basis  an undivided interest in eligible accounts receivable to investors 
the total capacity to transfer undivided interests to investors under the facility was million at december  and  respectively 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was million at both december  and the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by billion of accounts receivable at both december  and at both december  and  the value of the interest retained by upri was billion 
this retained interest is included in accounts receivable  net in our consolidated statements of financial position 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks  including default and dilution 
if default or dilution ratios increase one percent  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would not change as of december  should our 
table of contents credit rating fall below investment grade  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced  and  in certain cases  the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 
the railroad collected approximately billion and billion of receivables during the years ended december  and  respectively 
upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 
the costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest  which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates  program fees paid to banks  commercial paper issuing costs  and fees for unused commitment availability 
the costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the investors have no recourse to the railroad s other assets  except for customary warranty and indemnity claims 
creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 
in july  the receivables securitization facility was renewed for an additional day period at comparable terms and conditions 
subsequent event on january   we transferred an additional million in undivided interest to investors under the receivables securitization facility  increasing the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors from million to million 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition 
based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item a of part ii of this report  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity

none of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of december  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees at december   we were contingently liable for million in guarantees 
we have recorded a liability of million for the fair value of these obligations as of december  and we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business  and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building  equipment financings  and affiliated operations 
the final guarantee expires in we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees 
we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
other matters labor agreements approximately of our  full time equivalent employees are represented by major rail unions 
during the year  we concluded the most recent round of negotiations  which began in  with the ratification of new agreements by several unions that continued negotiating into all of the unions executed similar multi year agreements that provide for higher employee cost sharing of employee health and welfare benefits and higher wages 
the current agreements will remain in effect until renegotiated under provisions of the railway labor act 
the next round of negotiations will begin in early inflation long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies 
as a result  assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions  and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings 
we may use swaps  collars  futures  and or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices  however  the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 
market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item 
we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december  and  we were not required to provide collateral  nor had we received collateral  relating to our hedging activities 

table of contents determination of fair value we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 
at december   we had variable rate debt representing approximately of our total debt 
if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variable rate debt at december  market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to an increase of approximately billion to the fair value of our debt at december  we estimated the fair values of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
interest rate fair value hedges we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period 
we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings 
we employ derivatives  primarily swaps  as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 
swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates 
we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short cut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb asc  therefore  we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  we had no interest rate fair value hedges outstanding 
interest rate cash flow hedges we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings 
at december  and  we had reductions of million and million  respectively  recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straight line basis through september  as of december  and  we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 
accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu which requires presentation of the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the standard does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
also  in december of  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
on february   the fasb issued accounting standards update  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which adds additional disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this asu will be effective for the first interim reporting period in asserted and unasserted claims various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity  however  to the extent possible  where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded a liability 
we do not expect that any known lawsuits  claims  environmental costs  commitments  contingent liabilities  or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 
indemnities our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements  including certain tax indemnifications  can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount  depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements 
due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved  we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements 
we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 
climate change although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item a of this report  we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact 
however  we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment  including investments in new technologies  using training programs to reduce fuel consumption  and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note to the financial statements and supplementary data  item these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
personal injury the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability  including unasserted claims 
the federal employers liability act fela governs compensation for work related accidents 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value 
approximately of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims  and approximately is related to unasserted claims at december  because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims  it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately million to million 
we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 
estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 
our personal injury liability activity was as follows millions beginning balance current year accruals changes in estimates for prior years payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december 
table of contents our personal injury claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december asbestos we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos 
we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestos related claims 
this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs 
the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions the ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages adjusted for inflation 
the number of claims filed against us will decline each year 
the average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages 
the percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages 
our liability for asbestos related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately related to unasserted claims at december  because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claims  it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately million to million 
we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other 
our asbestos related liability activity was as follows millions beginning balance credits payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december our asbestos related claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december in conjunction with the liability update performed in  we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries 
we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december  and the amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims filed each year  average settlement costs  and insurance coverage issues  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts 
estimates also may vary in the future if strategies  activities  and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change  federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants  and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 

table of contents environmental costs we are subject to federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
we have identified sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 
when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned  leased  or otherwise used in our business  we perform  with assistance of our consultants  environmental assessments on the property 
we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred 
we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 
at december   none of our environmental liability was discounted  while less than of our environmental liability was discounted at at december  our environmental liability activity was as follows millions 
a 
beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december 
a 
payments include million to resolve the omaha lead site liability 
our environmental site activity was as follows open sites  beginning balance new sites closed sites open sites  ending balance at december the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws  and regulations 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal  state  and local laws governing environmental remediation 
current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
property and depreciation our railroad operations are highly capital intensive  and our large base of homogeneous  network type assets turns over on a continuous basis 
each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers 
assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria 
properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated service lives  which are measured in years  except for rail in high density traffic corridors ie  all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment  yard and switching tracks  and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track 
we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics  use  and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes  and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates 
the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources  not as singular items 
we currently have more than depreciable 
table of contents asset classes  and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology  asset strategies  or other factors 
we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies 
we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie  rail and other track material  ties  and ballast and other road property 
our depreciation studies take into account the following factors statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes  evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets  evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices  and expected salvage to be received upon retirement 
for rail in high density traffic corridors  we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track 
it has been our experience that the lives of rail in high density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie  the amount of weight carried over the rail 
the service lives also vary based on rail weight  rail condition eg  new or secondhand  and rail type eg  straight or curve 
our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives 
for rail in high density traffic corridors  we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton miles carried over the rail ie  the weight of loaded and empty freight cars  locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile 
rail in high density traffic corridors accounts for approximately percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material 
based on the number of gross ton miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during  the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately years to approximately years 
for all other depreciable assets  we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies 
changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 
estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use  technology  asset strategies  and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets 
we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets 
actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates  which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 
changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year  annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes 
based on these changes  depreciation expense will increase approximately to in versus under group depreciation  the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized 
the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies 
the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes 
because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired  we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate 
in addition  we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies 
any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 
for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business  a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is 
table of contents unusual  ii is material in amount  and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies 
during the last three fiscal years  no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties 
a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law  the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated 
future tax legislation  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
for example  a increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on management s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset 
in and  there were no valuation allowances 
we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
a liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 
pension and other postretirement benefits we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses  we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
for opeb  the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually  and selected assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on a mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds rated aa by a recognized rating agency for which the timing and amount of cash flows matches our plans expected benefit payments 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions 
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit for and the estimated impact on net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension opeb discount rate expected return on plan assets n a compensation increase n a health care cost trend rate pre current n a pre level in n a sensitivities increase in expense millions pension opeb decrease in discount rate increase in compensation scale n a decrease in expected return on plan assets n a increase in health care cost trend rate n a 
table of contents the following table presents the net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit for the years ended december millions est 
net periodic pension cost net periodic opeb cost benefit our net periodic pension cost is expected to increase to approximately million in from million in the increase is driven mainly by a decrease in the discount rate to  our net periodic opeb expense is expected to increase to approximately million in from million in the increase in our net periodic opeb cost is primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rate to
