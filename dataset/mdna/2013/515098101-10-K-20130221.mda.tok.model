introduction landstar system  inc and its subsidiary  landstar system holdings  inc together  referred to herein as landstar or the company  is a non asset based provider of freight transportation services and supply chain solutions 
the company offers services to its customers across multiple transportation modes  with the ability to arrange for individual shipments of freight to enterprise wide solutions to manage all of a customer s transportation and logistics needs 
landstar provides services principally throughout the united states and to a lesser extent in canada  and between the united states and canada  mexico and other countries around the world 
the company s services emphasize safety  information coordination and customer service and are delivered through a network of independent commission sales agents and third party capacity providers linked together by a series of technological applications which are provided and coordinated by the company 
landstar markets its freight transportation services and supply chain solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport and store customers freight 
the nature of the company s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue 
landstar markets its freight transportation services and supply chain solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents who enter into contractual arrangements with the company and are responsible for locating freight  making that freight available to landstar s capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers 
the company s third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company under exclusive lease arrangements the bco independent contractors  unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the company under non exclusive contractual arrangements the truck brokerage carriers  air cargo carriers  ocean cargo carriers  railroads and independent warehouse capacity providers warehouse capacity owners 
through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by landstar s information technology systems  landstar operates a transportation services and supply chain solutions business primarily throughout north america with revenue of billion during the most recently completed fiscal year 
the company reports the results of two operating segments the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment 
the transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of transportation services and supply chain solutions 
transportation services offered by the company include truckload and less than truckload transportation  rail intermodal  air cargo  ocean cargo  expedited ground and air delivery of time critical freight  heavy haul specialized  us canada and us mexico cross border  project cargo and customs brokerage 
supply chain solutions are based on advanced technology solutions utilizing intellectual property that may be owned by the company or licensed from third parties 
such solutions as offered by the company may include integrated multi modal solutions  outsourced logistics  supply chain engineering and warehousing 
industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive products  lumber and building products  metals  chemicals  foodstuffs  heavy machinery  retail  electronics  ammunition and explosives and military equipment 
in addition  the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies  including logistics and less than truckload service providers 
each of the independent commission sales agents has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment 
freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the 
table of contents physical transportation of freight 
supply chain solutions customers are generally charged fees for the services provided 
revenue recognized by the transportation logistics segment when providing capacity to customers to haul their freight is referred to herein as transportation services revenue and revenue for freight management services recognized on a fee for service basis is referred to herein as transportation management fees 
during  transportation services revenue hauled by bco independent contractors  truck brokerage carriers and railroads represented   and  respectively  of the company s transportation logistics segment revenue 
collectively  transportation services revenue hauled by air and ocean cargo carriers represented of the company s transportation logistics segment revenue during transportation management fees represented of the company s transportation logistics segment revenue in the insurance segment is comprised of signature insurance company  a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary  and risk management claim services  inc this segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of landstar s operating subsidiaries 
in addition  it reinsures certain risks of the company s bco independent contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of landstar s operating subsidiaries 
revenue at the insurance segment represents reinsurance premiums from third party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to bco independent contractors where all or a portion of the risk is borne by the company 
revenue at the insurance segment represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenue for changes in financial condition and results of operations management believes the company s success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers 
management believes the most significant factors to the company s success include increasing revenue  sourcing capacity and controlling costs  including insurance and claims 
while customer demand  which is subject to overall economic conditions  ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue  the company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities 
management s emphasis with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate million or more of landstar revenue million dollar agents 
management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by million dollar agents and the number of million dollar agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents 
the following table shows the number of million dollar agents  the average revenue generated by these agents and the percent of consolidated revenue generated by these agents during the past three fiscal years fiscal year number of million dollar agents average revenue generated per million dollar agent percent of consolidated revenue generated by million dollar agents management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads volume and revenue per load by mode of transportation 
revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price 
those factors include the average length of haul  freight type  special handling and equipment requirements  fuel costs and delivery time requirements 
for shipments involving two or more modes of transportation  revenue is 
table of contents classified by the mode of transportation having the highest cost for the load 
the following table summarizes information by mode of transportation for the past three fiscal years fiscal year revenue generated through in thousands bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean and air cargo carriers other number of loads bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean and air cargo carriers revenue per load bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean and air cargo carriers includes premium revenue generated by the insurance segment and warehousing and transportation management fee revenue generated by the transportation logistics segment 
also critical to the company s success is its ability to secure capacity  particularly truck capacity  at rates that allow the company to profitably transport customers freight 
the following table summarizes available truck capacity providers as of the end of the three most recent fiscal years dec 
 dec 
 dec 
 bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers approved and active other approved total available truck capacity providers number of trucks provided by bco independent contractors active refers to truck brokerage carriers who moved at least one load in the days immediately preceding the fiscal year end 
the company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to agents 
the company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims 
in addition  the company incurs selling  general and administrative costs essential to administering its business operations 
management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the company and establishes annual cost budgets which  in general  are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis 

table of contents purchased transportation represents the amount a bco independent contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight 
the amount of purchased transportation paid to a bco independent contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue generated by the haul 
purchased transportation paid to a truck brokerage carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed upon rate 
purchased transportation paid to railroads  air cargo carriers or ocean cargo carriers is based on contractually agreed upon fixed rates 
purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage  rail intermodal and ocean cargo services is normally higher than that of bco independent contractor and air cargo services 
purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and  on a consolidated basis  increases or decreases in proportion to the revenue generated through bco independent contractors and other third party capacity providers  transportation management fees and revenue from the insurance segment 
purchased transportation as a percent of revenue also increases or decreases in relation to the availability of truck brokerage capacity and the price of fuel on revenue hauled by truck brokerage carriers 
purchased transportation costs are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery 
commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed upon percentages of revenue or net revenue  defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation  or net revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by landstar 
commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation  transportation management fees and revenue from the insurance segment and with changes in net revenue margin  defined as net revenue divided by revenue  on services provided by truck brokerage carriers  railroads  air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers 
commissions to agents are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery 
the company defines gross profit as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents 
gross profit divided by revenue is referred to as gross profit margin 
the company s operating margin is defined as operating income divided by gross profit 
in general  gross profit margin on revenue hauled by bco independent contractors represents a fixed percentage of revenue due to the nature of the contracts that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to both the bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents 
for revenue hauled by truck brokerage carriers  gross profit margin is either fixed or variable as a percent of revenue  depending on the contract with each individual independent commission sales agent 
under certain contracts with independent commission sales agents  the company retains a fixed percentage of revenue and the agent retains the amount remaining less the cost of purchased transportation the retention contracts 
gross profit margin on revenue hauled by railroads  air cargo carriers  ocean cargo carriers and truck brokerage carriers  other than those under retention contracts  is variable in nature as the company s contracts with independent commission sales agents provide commissions to agents at a contractually agreed upon percentage of net revenue for these types of loads 
approximately of the company s revenue in had a fixed gross profit margin 
maintenance costs for company provided trailing equipment and bco independent contractor recruiting costs are the largest components of other operating costs 
also included in other operating costs are the provision for uncollectible advances and other receivables due from bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents and gains losses  if any  on sales of company owned trailing equipment 
potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable 
for commercial trucking claims  landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
the company also retains liability for each general liability claim up to   for each workers compensation claim and up to  for each cargo claim 
the company s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by truck brokerage carriers  railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage 
a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents  cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on landstar s cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations 

table of contents employee compensation and benefits account for over sixty percent of the company s selling  general and administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment  amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of information technology hardware and software

the initial complaint in the litigation was filed on november  the plaintiffs alleged that certain aspects of the company s motor carrier leases and related practices with its bco independent contractors violated certain federal leasing regulations and sought injunctive relief  an unspecified amount of damages and attorneys fees 
following a second trial in august in which all claims against the defendants were denied  the litigation was settled in december under the terms of the settlement  the plaintiffs dismissed their remaining claims in the litigation  each party agreed to bear its own costs and fees in the litigation  the parties exchanged releases  and ooida made a contribution to the bco benevolence fund  inc  a non profit corporation founded by the company to provide financial assistance to bco independent contractors in hardship situations 
also as further described in periodic and current reports previously filed by the company with the sec  in june  landstar system  inc received a civil investigative demand the cid from the united states attorney for the western district of kentucky the us attorney issued pursuant to a complaint the complaint filed by a third party under the false claims act 
the company cooperated fully with the cid  which requested documents and answers to written interrogatories limited to freight hauled to or from fort campbell  kentucky by certain subsidiaries of the company and billed to the us government 
in november  the company was informed by the us attorney of the dismissal of the complaint and the consent by the us government to such dismissal 
the company believes this matter has been concluded 
on september   a jury sitting in a state court in cobb county  georgia  entered a damage award of approximately million such amount  plus pre judgment interest  post judgment interest and a portion of plaintiffs attorney fees in an amount not yet determined are collectively referred to herein as the damage award against landstar ranger  inc  landstar system holdings  inc 
and landstar system  inc while a judgment has been entered by the court on the verdict  execution on that judgment is stayed and no judgment has been entered on the pre judgment interest claims and attorney fee claims due to the pendency of certain post trial motions 
the damage award arises out of an accident that occurred in february involving a bco independent contractor leased to landstar ranger  inc under the terms of the commercial trucking insurance program that landstar had in place in  landstar retained liability for up to million with respect to the accident giving rise to the damage award 
landstar has third party insurance and or reinsurance policies in place that are expected to provide coverage for all amounts of the damage award in excess of such retention  including all related out of pocket expenses  such as the costs of an appeal bond  interest and attorney fees comprising the damage award that may be entered by the trial court or an appellate court in the future 
the company recorded a million charge representing its self insured retention in respect of this accident in the consolidated financial results of the company in the first quarter 
accordingly  that portion of the damage award has been previously recorded by the company and therefore did not reduce consolidated operating income or net income for the company s or fiscal years 
under the terms of the company s insurance policies  the company is the primary obligor of the amount of the damage award  and as such  the company has reported a million receivable from the third party insurance providers in other receivables and a corresponding liability of the same amount in insurance claims in the consolidated balance sheets at december  the company and its insurers have filed post trial motions challenging the damage award and seeking a new trial and intend to appeal the damage award to the extent necessary following the resolution of those motions 
no assurances can be given regarding the outcome of the pending motions or any such appeal  including as to the impact of the damage award on the premiums charged by the company s third party insurers from time to time for commercial trucking insurance 
the company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation  including those described herein  arising from the normal conduct of business 
based on knowledge of the facts and  in certain cases  opinions of outside counsel  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the 
table of contents resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome  after provisions therefor  will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company  but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management s estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected 
historically  management s estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct 
although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at december  is appropriate  a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables 
in addition  liquidity concerns and or unanticipated bankruptcy proceedings at any of the company s larger customers in which the company is carrying a significant receivable could result in an increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables and have a significant impact on the company s results of operations in a given quarter or year 
however  it is not expected that an uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from an individual customer would have a significant impact on the company s financial condition 
conversely  a more robust economic environment or the recovery of a previously provided for uncollectible receivable from an individual customer may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables 
landstar provides for the estimated costs of self insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis 
the amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date 
the ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management 
the company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim 
historically  the company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior years claims estimates 
during fiscal year  insurance and claims costs included  of unfavorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates 
during fiscal years and  insurance and claims costs included  and  of favorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates  respectively 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims reserve at december  the company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes 
if the company were to be subject to an audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
certain of these tax planning strategies result in a level of uncertainty as to whether the related tax positions taken by the company would result in a recognizable benefit 
the company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to such tax positions due to the corresponding level of uncertainty with respect to the amount of income tax benefit that may ultimately be realized 
management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the uncertainty in certain income tax positions is appropriate 
to date  the company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the company s past provisions for exposures related to the uncertainty of such income tax positions are not appropriate 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill at least annually  typically in the fourth quarter  based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model 
the model includes a number of significant assumptions and estimates including future cash flows and discount rates 
such assumptions and estimates necessarily involve management judgments concerning  among other things  future revenues and profitability 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value under the first step of the impairment test  then the second step is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
only the first step of the impairment test was required in as the estimated fair value of the reporting units significantly exceeded carrying value 
the company purchased two companies in july  one of which was highly dependent on the us automotive manufacturing industry and the other of which was a start up 
on the date of the acquisitions  the 
table of contents company recorded  of goodwill 
the two acquired entities are considered one reporting unit as it relates to business valuation 
as it relates to goodwill recorded upon the acquisition of these companies in july  should the automotive industry experience a significant downturn and should the company fail to add customers to the technology platform acquired with the start up company  the company could determine that its goodwill is impaired in the future 
the company will continue to monitor the economic environment and test for impairment of goodwill as necessary 
significant variances from management s estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables  the ultimate resolution of self insured claims  the provision for uncertainty in income tax positions and impairment of goodwill could each be expected to positively or negatively affect landstar s earnings in a given quarter or year 
however  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items  given a range of reasonably likely outcomes  will not significantly affect the long term financial condition of landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations 
effects of inflation management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of landstar in the past five years 
however  inflation in excess of historical trends might have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
seasonality landstar s operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry 
results of operations for the quarter ending in march are typically lower than the quarters ending june  september and december
