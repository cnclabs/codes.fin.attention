item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion compares the company s financial condition at december  to its financial condition at december  and the results of operations for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in item of part ii of this annual report 
performance overview the company recorded a net loss of million in  compared to a net loss of thousand for and a net loss of million for the basic and diluted loss per common share was  and for  and  respectively 
when comparing to  the principal factors for the difference in results were an million increase in the provision for credit losses  a million decline in net interest income and a million loss incurred to terminate the ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge 
during  the slow economic recovery on the delmarva peninsula continued to negatively impact our loan portfolio performance and our overall financial performance 
for  the main contributors to the lower net loss when compared to were a million decrease in goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges and a million decrease in the provision for credit losses  which were partially offset by a decline in net interest income of million 
return on average assets was for  compared to for and for return on average stockholders equity for was  compared to for and for average assets were billion for  a increase when compared to average loans decreased to million while average earning assets increased to billion 
average deposits increased to billion while average stockholders equity decreased to million for comparing to  average assets increased less than  average loans decreased  and average earning assets remained relatively unchanged 
average deposits increased while average stockholders equity decreased for critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices  collateral value or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies that the company follows are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the financial statements and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policy with respect to the allowance for credit losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and  as such  could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
accordingly  the allowance for credit losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy  along with goodwill and other intangible assets and fair value  as discussed below 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the provision for credit losses and risk management section of this discussion 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
goodwill and other intangible assets are required to be recorded at fair value 
determining fair value is subjective  requiring the use of estimates  assumptions and management judgment 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment  usually during the third quarter  or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also are subject to impairment testing 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the company s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets  including goodwill 
the company s reporting units were identified based on an analysis of each of its individual operating segments 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value  an expense may be required to write down the related goodwill or purchased intangibles to record an impairment loss 
the company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the measurements made on a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities and interest rate caps 
impaired loans and other real estate and other assets owned are significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
in determining fair value  the company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs  reducing subjectivity 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies that the company adopted during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of this discussion and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin net interest income remains the most significant component of our earnings 
it is the excess of interest and fees earned on total average earning assets loans  investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks over interest owed on average interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
tax equivalent net interest income is net interest income adjusted for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
as shown in the table below  tax equivalent net interest income for was million  an decrease from the decrease was primarily due to lower yields earned on average earning assets and a decline in higher yielding average loan balances 
tax equivalent net interest income for decreased from for the same reasons as the decline in net interest income for our net interest margin ie  tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets represents the net yield on earning assets 
the net interest margin is managed through loan and deposit pricing and asset liability strategies 
the net interest margin was for  compared to for  representing a decline of basis points due to both the decrease in net interest income and increase in average earning assets 
the net interest margin declined basis points in when compared to primarily due to a decrease in net interest income 
the net interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities  was for  for and for in december  the company decided to partially exit the promontory insured network deposits program the ind program which it had participated in since the money market deposits associated with the program were million at december  and are expected to decline by million during the first quarter of interest rate caps were used to hedge the interest rates on these deposits  therefore  a portion of the interest rate caps was terminated 
by partially exiting the ind program and terminating a portion of the interest rate caps  money market deposit account balances and related interest expense are expected to decline 
the lower money market deposit account balances will reduce our excess liquidity and the lower related interest expense is expected to benefit the net interest margin going forward 
the effects of these transactions are expected to impact the company s financial results beginning in the first quarter of see the discussion below relating to interest expense and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the following table sets forth the major components of net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  for the years ended december    and average interest yield average interest yield average interest yield dollars in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate earning assets loans    investment securities taxable     tax exempt   federal funds sold   interest bearing deposits   total earning assets   cash and due from banks   other assets   allowance for credit losses   total assets   interest bearing liabilities demand deposits   money market and savings deposits   certificates of deposit   or more   other time deposits    interest bearing deposits   short term borrowings   long term debt total interest bearing liabilities   noninterest bearing deposits   other liabilities   stockholders equity   total liabilities and stockholders equity  net interest spread   net interest margin all amounts are reported on a tax equivalent basis computed using the statutory federal income tax rate of  exclusive of the alternative minimum tax rate and nondeductible interest expense 
the tax equivalent adjustment amounts used in the above table to compute yields aggregated thousand in  thousand in and thousand in average loan balances include nonaccrual loans 
interest income on loans includes amortized loan fees  net of costs  and all are included in the yield calculations 
interest on money market and savings deposits includes an adjustment to expense related to interest rate caps and the hedged deposits from the promontory insured network deposits program associated with them 
this adjustment increased interest expense by million for  million for and thousand for on a tax equivalent basis  total interest income was million for  compared to million for and million for the decline in interest income for both and was primarily due to loan activity 
during and  average loans decreased million and million  respectively  and the yield earned on loans decreased and basis points  respectively 
excluding average nonaccrual loans  the yield on loans would have been  and for   and  respectively 
the changes in all other average earning assets included an increase in interest bearing deposits with other banks of million and an increase of four basis points in the related yield  which increased interest income thousand 
beginning in and continuing in  the investment of excess cash from customers deposits shifted from federal funds sold to interest bearing deposits in other banks  primarily with the federal reserve bank  to take advantage of higher yields on these deposits 
while taxable investment securities increased million  the related yield declined basis points  which reduced interest income by thousand 
the yield on taxable investment securities decreased because the reinvestment rates on investment securities purchased during were lower than the yields on the investment securities that matured during the period 
the remaining earning assets  federal funds sold and tax exempt investment securities  declined million and million  respectively 
the yield on tax exempt securities increased six basis points while the yield on federal funds sold remained the same 
the changes in the balances and yields of these earning assets reduced interest income a combined thousand 
similarly for  average interest bearing deposits and taxable investment securities increased million and million  respectively  and the yield on interest bearing deposits increased four basis points while the yield on taxable securities decreased basis points 
the changes in the balances and yields of interest bearing deposits increased interest income thousand while the changes in taxable securities reduced interest income thousand when compared to federal funds sold and tax exempt investment securities declined million and million  respectively  and the yields on these assets declined five and basis points  respectively  which reduced interest income by a combined thousand 
as a percentage of total average earning assets  loans  investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits were   and  respectively  for the comparable percentages were    and  respectively  for and   and  respectively  for when comparing to  the overall decrease in yields on and average balances of earning assets both produced million less in interest income  as seen in the rate volume variance analysis below 
in  the overall decrease in yields on earning assets produced million less in interest income and the decrease in average balances of earning assets produced million less in interest income 
interest expense was million for  compared to million for and million for the decline in interest expense for both and was primarily due to lower expense on time deposits partially offset by higher expense on money market and savings accounts 
interest expense on time deposits certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits declined million when compared to due to a decrease of million in average time deposits and a decrease of basis points on rates paid on these deposits 
the decrease in average time deposits reflected a decrease in the company s liquidity needs and the lower rates reflected current market conditions 
during  average interest bearing demand deposits and money market and savings deposits increased million  offsetting the decline in average time deposits 
the rates paid on average interest bearing demand deposits decreased three basis points but the rates paid on money market and savings deposits increased basis points 
the changes in average balances and rates paid on these deposits increased interest expense by thousand when compared to interest expense for money market deposits included thousand more in than in related to interest rate caps and the hedged deposits associated with them 
during  the company bought the interest rate caps to effectively fix the interest rate at for five years on million of the company s money market deposit accounts related to our participation in the ind program 
in december  the company decided to partially exit the ind program as a way of decreasing its excess liquidity and expects that these deposits  which were million at december   will be reduced by million during the first quarter of as such  a portion of the interest rate caps used to hedge the interest rates on these deposits was terminated 
because the interest rate caps qualified for hedge accounting  a million loss on the termination of the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge was recognized at the end of by partially exiting the ind program and terminating a portion of the interest rate caps  the hedged money market deposit account balances associated with the interest rate caps and related interest expense are expected to decline 
the company expects that the charge to interest expense associated with the hedged deposits over the next months will be approximately million  which is thousand less than if a portion of the cash flow hedge had not been terminated 
the lower money market deposit account balances will reduce our excess liquidity and the lower related interest expense is expected to benefit the net interest margin going forward 
the effects of these transactions are expected to impact the company s financial results beginning in the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the effect of the interest rate caps on interest expense 
for  average time deposits decreased million and rates paid decreased basis points  which lowered interest expense by million when compared to average interest bearing demand deposits and money market and savings deposits increased million and the rates paid on these deposits increased basis points  which increased interest expense by thousand when compared to interest expense included thousand more in than in related to the interest rate caps 
during  lower rates on interest bearing liabilities produced thousand less in interest expense and increased volume produced thousand more in interest expense  as shown in the table below 
in  lower rates produced million less in interest expense and decreased volume produced thousand less in interest expense

noninterest income noninterest income decreased million  or  in when compared to this compared to a decrease of thousand  or  in when compared to the decrease in noninterest income in when compared to was mainly due to a million loss on the termination of a cash flow hedge which is discussed above under the caption net interest income and net interest margin 
the decline in noninterest income for also included decreases in gains on sales of investment securities thousand and service charges on deposit accounts thousand  partially offset by an increase in insurance agency commissions thousand 
the decrease in noninterest income in when compared to was mainly due to declines in insurance agency commissions of thousand  service charges on deposit accounts of thousand and other noninterest income of thousand 
the decline in insurance agency commissions reflected the ongoing soft market in the insurance industry and the decline in service charges on deposit accounts reflected a decrease in customer use of overdraft protection programs 
the primary reason for the lower amount in other noninterest income was a thousand gain relating to the surrender of directors life insurance policies in in  the decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by thousand in gains on sales of investment securities

salaries and wages included amounts relating to the hiring of a new executive vice president at the talbot bank of easton  maryland during the second quarter of last year as part of that bank s succession plan  and a new lender at cnb for the delaware region during the third quarter of last year 
other noninterest expenses included higher amounts relating to collection expense for loans thousand and provision for off balance sheet credit losses thousand 
a significant portion of the decrease in noninterest expense in when compared to was due to million less in goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges 
as a result of the annual assessment for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment  it was determined that goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired primarily in our retail insurance business 
the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and other intangible assets impairment charges of thousand 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
when comparing to  in addition to the large decrease in impairment charges  salaries and wages declined thousand due to cost containment measures  fdic insurance premium expense declined thousand due to regulatory changes in the calculation of the premium  and insurance agency commissions expense declined thousand 
these decreases in expenses were somewhat offset by higher expenses related to write downs of other real estate owned and higher data processing charges related to the merger of the felton bank into cnb during the first quarter of we had full time equivalent employees at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively

total interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold increased million from million at december  to million at december  average interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold increased million to million for the year ended december  total interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold increased million from the end of to the end of average interest bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold increased million in beginning in and continuing through  the investment of excess cash from customers deposits shifted from federal funds sold to interest bearing deposits in other banks to take advantage of higher yields on these deposits 
average federal funds sold decreased million and million in and  respectively  while average interest bearing deposits increased million and million in and  respectively 
investment securities the investment portfolio is structured to provide us with liquidity and also plays an important role in the overall management of interest rate risk 
investment securities available for sale are stated at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices 
they represent securities which may be sold as part of the asset liability management strategy or which may be sold in response to changing interest rates 
net unrealized holding gains and losses on these securities are reported net of related income taxes as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity 
investment securities in the held to maturity category are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
we have the intent and current ability to hold such securities until maturity

with the exception of municipal securities  our general practice is to classify all newly purchased securities as available for sale 
investment securities available for sale were million at the end of and million at the end of investment securities available for sale increased million  or  for  and million  or  for investment activity for included sales of million in mortgage backed securities which generated a gain of thousand

investment securities held to maturity  consisting primarily of tax exempt municipal bonds  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the balance continues to decline because there were only maturities and no purchases of investment securities held to maturity during and we do not typically invest in structured notes or other derivative securities

loans at the end of  loans declined when compared to the prior year because fewer high quality loan opportunities and the level of loan charge offs continued to deter overall loan growth 
loans totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from loans included deferred costs net of deferred fees of thousand at year end and thousand at year end most of our loans are secured by real estate 
real estate loans are classified as construction  residential or commercial real estate loans 
total real estate loans decreased million  or  from year end to year end the decrease in real estate loans was mainly due to declines in residential real estate loans of million  or  and construction loans of million  or 
commercial real estate loans declined slightly from the end of commercial loans  which include financial and agricultural loans  decreased million  or  and consumer loans  a small percentage of the overall loan portfolio  decreased million  or  from the end of to the end of at december   of the loan portfolio had fixed interest rates and had adjustable interest rates

average interest bearing demand deposits  and money market and savings deposits increased in aggregate million  or 
partially offsetting these increases  average time deposits decreased million  or  during mainly due to a reduction in the company s liquidity needs  a shift in customer investment needs and a decline in deposits of a large municipal customer 
as previously mentioned  in december  the company decided to partially exit the ind program and expects that the money market deposit accounts associated with the program will decline by approximately million during the first quarter of and reduce excess liquidity 
similar to  average deposit growth for was primarily in noninterest bearing deposits  interest bearing demand deposits  and money market and savings deposits which increased in aggregate million  or 
average time deposits decreased million  or  during mainly due to a reduction in the company s liquidity needs and because the deposits of some of the local government municipalities decreased due to reduced tax revenues

securities sold under agreements to repurchase are issued in conjunction with cash management services for commercial depositors 
we also borrow from the fhlb on a short term basis and occasionally borrow from correspondent banks under federal fund lines of credit arrangements to meet short term liquidity needs

long term debt was related to the acquisition of tsgia and the final payment was made on october capital management total stockholders equity for the company was million at december   lower than in the previous year 
the decrease in stockholders equity in was primarily due to the million loss recorded 
stockholders equity at december  decreased from december  the decrease in stockholders equity in was primarily due to the thousand loss recorded and thousand in dividends paid on shares of the common stock of the company 
in  the board of directors of the company voted to suspend quarterly cash dividends on common stock until further notice 
in  the company reduced the quarterly cash dividend to from per share which was reduced in from per share 
the reduction in dividends was intended primarily to mitigate declines in stockholders equity and capital ratios 
even though stockholders equity has decreased  the company and the banks continued to maintain capital at levels in excess of the risk based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies  as seen in the table below 
at year end  the company remained well in excess of regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions

provision for credit losses and risk management originating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to  among other factors  the types of loans being made  the credit worthiness of the borrowers over the terms of the loans  the quality of the collateral for the loans  if any  as well as general economic conditions 
the company s board of directors demands accountability of management  keeping the interests of stockholders in focus 
through the company s and banks asset liability management committees and the company s audit committee  the board actively reviews critical risk positions  including credit  market  liquidity and operational risk 
the company s goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility  control exposure to unnecessary risk  and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed 
senior members of management actively manage risk at the product level  supplemented with corporate level oversight through the asset liability management committee and internal audit function 
the risk management structure is designed to identify risk issues through a systematic process  enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk 
credit risk is mitigated through loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to any single industry or customer  collateral protection  and standard lending policies and underwriting criteria 
the following discussion provides information and statistics on the overall quality of the company s loan portfolio 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies related to nonperforming loans nonaccrual  delinquent days or more and troubled debt restructurings and loan charge offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for credit losses  including the specific  formula and nonspecific components also discussed below 
management believes the policies governing nonperforming loans and charge offs are consistent with regulatory standards 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the resulting provision are reviewed monthly by senior members of management and approved quarterly by the board of directors 
the allowance is increased by provisions for credit losses charged to expense and recoveries of loans previously charged off 
it is decreased by loans charged off in the current period 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when considered uncollectible by management 
provisions for credit losses are made to bring the allowance for credit losses within the range of balances that are considered appropriate based on the results of the allowance methodology and to reflect losses within the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as loan delinquency trends  nonaccrual loans and current market conditions 
management believes the current allowance is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio  however  future changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and financial condition of borrowers may result in additions to the allowance 
examination of the portfolio and allowance by various regulatory agencies and consultants engaged by the company may result in the need for additional provisions based on information available at the time of the examination 
each of the banks maintains a separate allowance for credit losses  which is only available to absorb losses from their respective loan portfolios 
the allowance set by each of the banks is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to its adequacy 
the allowance for credit losses is comprised of three parts i the specific allowance  ii the formula allowance  and iii the nonspecific allowance 
the specific allowance is established against impaired loans until charge offs are made 
loans are considered impaired ie  nonaccrual loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings when it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the loan s contractual terms 
the formula allowance is determined based on management s assessment of industry trends and economic factors in the markets in which we operate 
the determination of the formula allowance involves a higher risk of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in our historical loss factors 
the nonspecific allowance captures losses that have impacted the portfolio but have yet to be recognized in either the specific or formula allowance 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance to loans identified as impaired 
an impaired loan may involve deficiencies in the borrower s overall financial condition  payment history  support available from financial guarantors and or the fair market value of collateral 
if it is determined that there is a loss associated with an impaired loan  a specific allowance is established until a charge off is made 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
the formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk rated loans  exclusive of those identified as impaired 
loans are grouped by type construction  residential real estate  commercial real estate  commercial or consumer 
each loan type is assigned allowance factors based on management s estimate of the risk  complexity and size of individual loans within a particular category 
loans that are identified as special mention  substandard and doubtful are adversely rated 
these loans are assigned higher allowance factors than favorably rated loans due to management s concerns regarding collectability or management s knowledge of particular elements regarding the borrower 
the nonspecific allowance is used to estimate the loss on loans stemming from more global factors such as delinquencies  loss history  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  the experience and depth of management  national and local economic trends  concentrations of credit  the quality of the loan review system and the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements 
the slow economic recovery on the delmarva peninsula materially impacted our performance in because most of our loans are secured by real estate  the lack of a meaningful upturn in real estate related activities in our local real estate market and construction industry and slow improvement in general economic conditions have had a material adverse effect on the performance of our loan portfolio and the value of the collateral securing that portfolio 
factors impeding our loan performance and overall financial performance include our levels of loan charge offs and provisions for credit losses 
as seen in the table below  the allowance for credit losses was million  or of average outstanding loans at december   compared to an allowance of million  or of average outstanding loans at december  at december   the allowance for credit losses was million  or of average outstanding loans 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was in  in and in the provision for credit losses was million for  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the level of provision for credit losses was primarily in response to loan charge offs 
net loan charge offs totaled million in  million in and million in real estate loans were  and of total loans charged off during  and  respectively 
although credit quality has been negatively impacted by weak economic conditions  we continue to observe strong underwriting guidelines 
however  when problem loans are identified  management takes prompt action to quantify and minimize losses in its focused efforts to dispose of existing problem loans 
management expects to continue charging off nonperforming assets as rapidly as possible  to enable the company to improve its overall credit quality and permanently reduce problem loans 
in appropriate cases  management also works with borrowers in an effort to reach mutually acceptable resolutions

the change in the components of nonperforming assets reflected our continued effort to either develop concessionary workouts relating to problem loans or remove problem loans from our portfolio

our principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from our lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is largely dependent on the banks net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the company s and banks asset liability management committees oversee the management of interest rate risk 
the primary purpose of these committees is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes due to interest rate fluctuations 
these efforts affect our loan pricing and deposit rate policies as well as asset mix  volume guidelines  and liquidity and capital planning 
during  the company began using derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives for any trading or other speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on hedging activities 
because we are not exposed to market risk from trading activities and do not use off balance sheet management strategies  the asset liability management committees of the company and banks rely on gap analysis as a tool in managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis summarizes the amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  which will reprice over various time intervals 
the excess between the volume of assets and liabilities repricing in each interval is the interest sensitivity gap 
positive gap occurs when more assets reprice in a given time interval  while negative gap occurs when more liabilities reprice 
at december   as shown in the table below  we had an overall negative gap position within the one year repricing interval because the interest sensitive liabilities exceeded the interest sensitive assets within the one year repricing interval by million  or of total assets 
the negative gap position within the one year interval at december  totaled million  or of total assets 
the million increase in the one year negative gap for when compared to was primarily due to fewer loans million partially offset by more interest bearing deposits with other banks million  and more interest bearing demand and money market and savings deposits million 
management expects that the negative gap position within the one year interval will decline in due to partially exiting the ind program which will reduce money market deposits associated with the program approximately million 
the negative gap position within the one year interval at december   totaled million  or of total assets  similar to the negative gap position at the end of the following table summarizes our interest sensitivity at december  loans  federal funds sold  time deposits and short term borrowings are classified based on contractual maturities if fixed rate or earliest repricing date if variable rate

the model takes into consideration the effect of call features of investment securities as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates 
the chart below summarizes the forecasted results provided by the simulation model for net interest income and the fair value of capital as of year end and for example  the model projects that  compared with net interest income under stable rates  net interest income would increase if interest rates increased basis points 
conversely  net interest income would decrease if interest rates decreased basis points 
when actual changes in interest rates occur  the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model 
due to the low interest rate environment  we believe the results of the minus basis point change in rates are not meaningful 
immediate change in rates basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points change in net interest income n a change in value of capital n a change in net interest income n a change in value of capital n a off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  to meet the financing needs of its customers  the banks are parties to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the banks exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
the banks use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they use for on balance sheet instruments 
the banks generally require collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk 
the amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
the banks evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
further information about these arrangements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity management liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits  maturities in the investment portfolio  loan repayments and income from earning assets 
to the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand  liquidity needs can be met in the short term funds markets 
we have arrangements with correspondent banks whereby we have million available in federal funds lines of credit and a reverse repurchase agreement available to meet any short term needs which may not otherwise be funded by the banks portfolio of readily marketable investments that can be converted to cash 
the banks are also members of the fhlb  which provides another source of liquidity  and had credit availability of approximately million from the fhlb as of december  at december   our loan to deposit ratio was approximately  which represents a more liquid position than the and at year end and  respectively 
investment securities available for sale totaling million at the end of were available for the management of liquidity and interest rate risk 
the comparable amounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   compared to million at year end and million at year end management expects that excess liquidity will decline in due to the company s partial exit of the ind program which will reduce money market deposits associated with the program by approximately million 
similarly  we were in a more liquid position at the end of than we were at the end of management is not aware of any demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels 
we have various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments
