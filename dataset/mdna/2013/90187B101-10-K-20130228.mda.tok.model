table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general we are a maryland corporation focused on investing in  financing and managing residential mortgage backed securities  or rmbs  residential mortgage loans  and other financial assets 
we operate as a real estate investment trust  or reit  as defined under the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
we are externally managed by prcm advisers llc 
prcm advisers is a wholly owned subsidiary of pine river capital management lp  or pine river  a global asset management firm providing solutions to qualified clients across three actively managed platforms hedge funds  managed accounts and listed investment vehicles 
our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long term  primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation 
we selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets  which we believe is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles 
our target assets include the following agency rmbs which includes inverse interest only agency securities classified as agency derivatives for purposes of us gaap  meaning rmbs whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the government national mortgage association or ginnie mae  the federal national mortgage association or fannie mae  or the federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac  non agency rmbs  meaning rmbs that are not issued or guaranteed by ginnie mae  fannie mae or freddie mac  residential mortgage loans  and other financial assets comprising approximately to of the portfolio 
we believe our hybrid agency and non agency rmbs investment model allows management to focus on security selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the residential mortgage market  which factors in the opportunities in the marketplace  cost of financing and cost of hedging interest rate  prepayment  credit and other portfolio risks 
as a result  rmbs asset allocation reflects management opportunistic approach to investing in the marketplace 
during the year ended december   we did not significantly modify our rmbs asset allocation between agency and non agency rmbs 
the following table provides the rmbs asset allocation between agency and non agency rmbs as of december  and the four immediately preceding period ends as of december  september  june  march  december  agency rmbs non agency rmbs as our rmbs asset allocation shifts  our annualized yields and cost of financing shifts 
as previously discussed  our investment decisions are not driven solely by annualized yields  but rather a multitude of macroeconomic drivers  including market environments and their respective impacts  for example  uncertainty of faster prepayments  extension risk and credit events 

table of contents for the three months ended december   our net interest spread realized on agency and non agency rmbs was lower than prior periods 
based on recent experience  yields and net interest spreads on agency and non agency rmbs securities are generally lower than what we have historically realized in our portfolio 
the following table provides the average annualized yield on our agency and non agency rmbs for the three months ended december   and the four immediately preceding quarters three months ended december  september  june  march  december  average annualized yields agency rmbs non agency rmbs aggregate rmbs cost of financing net interest spread average annualized yield incorporates future prepayment  credit loss and other assumptions  all of which are estimates and subject to change 
cost of financing includes swap interest rate spread 
the following table provides the average annualized yield expected on our agency and non agency rmbs as of december   and the four immediately preceding period ends as of december  september  june  march  december  average annualized yields agency rmbs non agency rmbs aggregate rmbs cost of financing net interest spread average annualized yield incorporates future prepayment  credit loss and other assumptions  all of which are estimates and subject to change 
cost of financing includes swap interest rate spread 
we seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy 
we generally finance our rmbs assets through short term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements 
our agency rmbs  given their liquidity and high credit quality  are eligible for higher levels of leverage  while non agency rmbs  with less liquidity and exposure to credit risk  utilize lower levels of leverage 
we also finance our us treasuries  which we hold for trading purposes  and our mortgage loans 
we believe the debt to equity ratio funding our agency rmbs  non agency and residential mortgage loans is the most meaningful leverage measure as us treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature 
as a result  our debt to equity ratio is determined by our rmbs portfolio mix as well as many additional factors  including the liquidity of our portfolio  the sustainability and price of our financing  diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our rmbs assets  and anticipated regulatory developments 
over the past several quarterly periods  we have generally maintained a debt to equity ratio range of to times to finance our rmbs portfolio and mortgage loans  on a fully deployed capital basis 
our debt to equity ratio is directly correlated to the make up of our rmbs portfolio  specifically  the higher percentage of agency rmbs we hold  the higher our debt to equity ratio is  and vice versa 
we may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio between agency and non agency rmbs depending on the quality of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time  including at times when we are deploying proceeds from common stock offerings we conduct 
the debt to equity ratio range has been driven by our relatively stable asset allocation between agency and non agency rmbs  as disclosed above 
see the section titled management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition repurchase agreements for further discussion 

table of contents we compete with other investment vehicles for attractive investment opportunities 
we rely on our management team and pine river  who have developed strong relationships with a diverse group of financial intermediaries  to identify investment opportunities 
in addition  we have benefited and expect to continue to benefit from pine river analytical and portfolio management expertise and infrastructure 
we believe that our significant focus on the rmbs area  the extensive rmbs expertise of our investment team  our strong analytics and our disciplined relative value investment approach give us a competitive advantage versus our peers 
we have elected to be treated as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
to qualify as a reit we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements 
we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders  do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a reit 
however  certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for reit purposes 
we have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  as defined in the code  to engage in such activities  and we may form additional trss in the future 
we also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the investment company act of  as amended  or the act 
on december   we completed the contribution of our portfolio of single family rental properties to silver bay realty trust corp 
silver bay  a newly organized maryland corporation intended to qualify as a reit and focused on the acquisition  renovation  leasing and management of single family residential properties for rental income and long term capital appreciation 
we contributed our equity interests in the wholly owned subsidiary  two harbors property investment llc to silver bay  and in exchange for the contribution  received shares of common stock of silver bay 
silver bay completed its initial public offering  or ipo  of its common stock on december  as we will not have any significant continuing involvement in two harbors property investment llc  all of the associated operating results were removed from continuing operations and are presented separately as discontinued operations for the years ended december  and overview our efforts focused on three strategic objectives that we believe will position us for long term success 
managing a portfolio of rmbs to generate attractive returns with balanced risks 
we operate a hybrid reit model  diversifying our portfolio across agency and non agency rmbs in combination with derivative hedging instruments 
we manage to an overall low level of interest rate exposure and leverage 
we believe carrying a balance of risks within our portfolio is critical to providing an attractive return to our stockholders and our ability to adjust our allocations and deploy capital across sectors allow us to optimize portfolio results over time 
growing our stockholder base and market capitalization to enhance stockholder liquidity and reduce operating expense ratios 
during  we completed three common stock offerings  increasing our market capitalization to approximately billion as of december  proceeds from these offerings were deployed efficiently due to opportunities in the market  focusing on assets with attractive risk adjusted returns 
by doing so  we achieved a corresponding increase in daily trading volume  further diversity in stockholder base  and a lower expense ratio as a percentage of equity 
exploring business diversification opportunities in residential mortgage loans and other real estate assets 
we pursued a variety of potential opportunities that leverage our core competencies of credit and prepayment risk management 
in late  we announced our plan to establish a nonconforming loan securitization program 
as of december   we have established the infrastructure for this program  purchased million in loans  and we continue to build our originator network to source loans 
in late  we announced our interest in pursuing csls and msrs 
as of december   we had not purchased any of these assets 
we are taking a measured approach as we diversify  keeping true to our strategic long term plans and our core strengths 
factors affecting our operating results our net interest income includes income from our rmbs portfolio and will reflect the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts 
net interest income will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates  our financing costs  and prepayment speeds on our assets 
interest rates  financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
our operating results will also be affected by default rates and credit losses with respect to the mortgage loans underlying our non agency rmbs 

table of contents fair value measurement asc defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date 
it also establishes three levels of input to be used when measuring fair value level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date under current market conditions 
additionally  the entity must have the ability to access the active market and the quoted prices cannot be adjusted by the entity 
level inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities  or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs are supported by little or no market activity 
the unobservable inputs represent the assumptions that market participants would use to price the assets and liabilities  including risk 
generally  level assets and liabilities are valued using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques that require significant judgment or estimation 
we follow the fair value hierarchy set forth above in order to prioritize the data utilized to measure fair value 
we strive to obtain quoted market prices in active markets level inputs 
if level inputs are not available  we will attempt to obtain level inputs  observable market prices in inactive markets or derive the fair value measurement using observable market prices for similar assets or liabilities 
when neither level nor level inputs are available  we use level inputs and independent pricing service models to estimate fair value measurements 
at december   approximately of total assets  or billion  and approximately of total liabilities  or million  consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value 
as of december   we had million  or less than one percent  of total assets reported at fair value using level inputs 
see note fair value to the consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report on form k  for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models  key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized 
a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are at fair value and  therefore  our consolidated balance sheet and income statement are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices 
although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value  we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices 
starting in  markets for asset backed securities  including rmbs  have experienced severe dislocations 
while these market disruptions continue  our assets and liabilities will be subject to valuation adjustment as well as changes in the inputs we use to measure fair value 
for the year ended december   our unrealized fair value losses on interest rate swap and swaption agreements  which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under gaap  negatively affected our financial results 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a result of changes to libor  the swap curve  and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the year ended december  our financial results for the year ended december  were positively affected by unrealized fair value gains on certain us treasuries classified as trading instruments due to their short term investment objectives  equity securities  which consist solely of shares of silver bay common stock  and mortgage loans held for sale 
for the year ended december   our unrealized fair value losses on interest rate swap and swaption agreements  which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under gaap  negatively affected our financial results 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a result of decreases in the swap curve during the year ended december  our financial results for the year ended december  were positively affected by unrealized fair value gains on certain us treasuries classified as trading instruments 
in addition  our financial results for the year ended december  and were affected by the unrealized gains and losses of certain other derivative instruments that were accounted for as trading derivative instruments  ie  credit default swaps  tbas and inverse interest only securities 
any temporary change in the fair value of our available for sale securities is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and does not impact our earnings 
we have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements 
significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval 
our entire investment portfolio is priced by third party brokers at the bid side of the market  and or by independent pricing providers 
we strive to obtain multiple market data points for each valuation 
by utilizing bid side pricing  certain assets  especially the most recent purchases  may realize a markdown due to the bid offer spread 
to the extent that this occurs  any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we back test the fair value measurements provided by the pricing providers against actual performance 
we also monitor the market for recent trades  market surveys  or other market information that may be used to benchmark pricing provider inputs 

table of contents considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our level fair value measurements 
level inputs such as interest rate movements  prepayments speeds  credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate 
changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements 
accordingly  there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions  based on information available at the time of our preparation of the financial statements  in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
classification and valuation of available for sale and trading securities our rmbs investments consist primarily of agency rmbs and non agency rmbs that we classify as available for sale  or afs 
our rmbs classified as available for sale are carried at their fair value  with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
we also hold us treasuries for trading purposes 
our trading securities are carried at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of gain on investment securities  net in earnings 
if our rmbs afs were also classified as trading securities  there could be substantially greater volatility in our earnings 
when the estimated fair value of an available for sale security is less than amortized cost  we consider whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security that is required to be recognized in the statement of operations 
the determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors 
consideration is given to whether we have the intent to sell the investment securities  are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery  or do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities 
investments with unrealized losses are not considered other than temporarily impaired if we have the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time  to maturity if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the amortized cost basis of the investments 
if an impairment is determined to be solely driven by the inability to fully recover the entire amortized cost basis over the remaining life of the security  the security is further analyzed for credit loss the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis 
the credit loss  if any  is then recognized in the statement of operations  while the balance of impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
classification and valuation of equity securities our equity securities  which consist solely of shares of silver bay common stock  are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election  with changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
fair value is determined based on the closing market price at period end 
classification and valuation of mortgage loans held for sale our mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election  with changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
fair value is generally determined based on current secondary market pricing and cash flow models using market based yield requirements 
the methods used by us to estimate fair value for available for sale securities  trading securities  equity securities  and mortgage loans may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values 
furthermore  while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies  or assumptions  to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
we use inputs that are current as of the measurement date  which in periods of market dislocation  may have reduced price transparency 
interest income recognition our interest income on our agency rmbs and non agency rmbs is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  as adjusted for actual prepayments 
we estimate prepayments for our agency interest only securities  which represent our right to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest flows of specific agency and collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmo  securities 
as a result  if prepayments increase or are 
table of contents expected to increase  we will accelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums 
conversely  if prepayments decrease or are expected to decrease  we will decelerate the rate of amortization on the premiums 
our interest income on our non agency rmbs securities rated below aa  including unrated securities  is recognized in accordance with estimated cash flows 
cash flows from a security are estimated by applying assumptions used to determine the fair value of such security and the excess of the future cash flows over the investment are recognized as interest income under the effective yield method 
we review and  if appropriate  make adjustments to our cash flow projections at least quarterly and monitor these projections based on input and analysis received from external sources  internal models  and our judgment about interest rates  prepayment rates  the timing and amount of credit losses  and other factors 
changes in cash flows from those originally projected  or from those estimated at the last evaluation  may result in a prospective change in interest income recognized on  or the carrying value of  such securities 
for non agency securities purchased at a discount  we account for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from our initial investment in debt securities acquired if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
we limit the yield that may be accreted accretable yield to the excess of an estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected over the initial investment 
the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected nonaccretable difference or designated credit reserve is not recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual  or valuation allowance 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield over the remaining life of the security 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairments 
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities we apply the provisions of asc  derivatives and hedging  which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value 
the fair value adjustments of our current derivative instruments affect net income as the hedge for accounting purposes is being treated as an economic  or trading  hedge and not as a qualifying hedging instrument 
derivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we rely on internal models corroborated by quotations from a third party to determine these fair values 
if our hedging activities do not achieve their desired results  our reported earnings may be adversely affected 
income taxes our financial results are generally not expected to reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes  except for those taxable benefits or provisions recognized by our taxable reit subsidiary 
we estimate  based on existence of sufficient evidence  the ability to realize the remainder of any deferred tax asset our trss recognize 
any adjustments to such estimates will be made in the period such determination is made 
we plan to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit 
as a result of our expected reit qualification  we do not generally expect to pay us federal corporate level taxes 
many of the reit requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet the reit requirements  we would be subject to us federal  state and local income taxes 
market conditions and outlook the key macroeconomic factors that impact our business are home prices  interest rates and employment 
home price performance is important to our non agency portfolio 
we are continuing to see signs of stabilization and some improvement in housing prices 
according to corelogic  national home prices increased as of january  on a rolling month basis 
more forecasts call for a continuation of home price appreciation in the next several years  albeit at a slower pace than despite the improvement in housing prices  loan to values remain high and limit refinancing ability despite low rates and government policy programs 
the low interest rate environment is expected to persist  influencing funding costs and prepayment speeds 
low federal funds target rate should benefit funding costs for the next few years 
current employment trends are improving  but unemployment levels remain stubbornly high 
next to loan to value ratios  employment is the most powerful determinant of a homeowner ongoing likelihood to pay their mortgage the fiscal year continued to produce a number of regulatory actions in an effort to stabilize economic conditions and increase liquidity in the financial markets 
while not intended to be comprehensive  listed below are a few of the more notable regulatory and market events the federal reserve continued actions to lower long term interest rates 
on june  operation twist was extended until the end of the policy  which began in october  involved selling short term us treasuries in exchange for the same amount of longer term bonds intended to lower yields on longer term bonds and push down interest rates for mortgages and similar borrowings 
on september  the federal reserve announced plans to launch qe  a policy that involves buying billion in mortgage backed securities each month  the intent of which is to continue downward pressure on longer term interest rates  support mortgage markets  and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative 
the federal reserve also indicated that it plans to keep short term interest rates at exceptionally low levels until mid 
table of contents the fhfa harp program continues until december   in an effort to attract more eligible borrowers who can benefit from refinancing their home mortgage 
key provisions of the program include eliminating certain risk based fees for borrowers  removing the percent loan to value ltv ceiling  waiving certain representations and warranties  and eliminating the need for new property appraisals where there is a reliable automated valuation model avm 
the program objective to provide an opportunity for responsible homeowners to refinance and encourage borrowers to continue paying on their loans will impact the prepayment speed on certain rmbs 
we continue to anticipate that our portfolio prepayment protection characteristics will be largely isolated from this program 
senators boxer and menendez plan to reintroduce their refinance legislation  the responsible homeowner refinancing act  or harp  in the bill seeks to expand eligibility under harp by removing barriers to competition  guaranteeing equal access to streamlined refinancing for all gse borrowers  eliminating up front fees on refinances and appraisal costs for all borrowers  and further streamlining the application process 
the bill extends harp for an additional year 
government programs to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures continue to be in effect  including hamp and other programs 
these homeowner assistance programs may involve the modification of mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans through forbearance and or forgiveness or the rate of interest payable on the loans  or may extend the payment terms of the loans 
they may also allow for streamlined financing  thus increasing prepayments  or for a delay in foreclosures  thus potentially altering the timing and amount of cash flows to certain securities 
in general  these homeowner assistance programs  as well as future legislative or regulatory actions  may affect the value of  and the returns on  our rmbs portfolio 
to the extent that these programs are successful and fewer borrowers default on their mortgage obligations  the actual default rates realized on our non agency rmbs may be less than the default assumptions made by us at the purchase of such non agency rmbs 
this could cause the realized yields on our non agency rmbs portfolio to be higher than expected at time of purchase 
conversely  if these programs lead to forced reductions in principal  certain rmbs could be affected and decrease in value 
the following table provides the weighted average cpr on our agency rmbs throughout three months ended agency rmbs march  june  september  december  weighted average cpr we expect that fiscal year will continue to see regulatory developments in an effort to stabilize economic conditions and increase liquidity in the financial markets 
the us economy continues to be burdened by the european debt crisis  elevated unemployment numbers and a struggling housing market  which  despite signs of an approaching recovery  remains burdened with backlogs of homes in the foreclosure process 
meanwhile  mortgage servicers continue to evaluate the impacts of the proposed settlement with state attorneys general over improper foreclosure practices and the adoption by several states of various legislation aimed at curtailing or modifying foreclosure processes 
events such as these may affect our portfolio 
we believe our blended agency and non agency strategies and our investing expertise will allow us to better navigate the dynamic characteristics of the rmbs environment while gse reform and any other future regulatory efforts take shape 
having a diversified portfolio allows us to mitigate risks  including the volatility and impacts generated by uncertainty in interest rates and changes in prepayments  home prices and homeowner default rates 
as such  we are exploring new opportunities that capitalize on our prepayment and credit expertise  including prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans  credit sensitive loans and mortgage servicing rights 
we expect that the majority of our assets will remain in whole pool agency rmbs in light of the long term attractiveness of the asset class and in order to continue to satisfy the requirements of our exemption from registration under the act 
interest only agency securities also provide a complementary investment and risk management strategy to our principal and interest agency rmbs investments 
risk adjusted returns in our agency rmbs portfolio may decline if we are required to pay higher purchase premiums due to lower interest rates or additional liquidity in the market 
additionally  the federal reserve open ended program to purchase rmbs may impact the returns of our agency rmbs portfolio 

table of contents the following table provides the carrying value of our rmbs portfolio by product type dollars in thousands december  december  agency fixed rate hybrid arms total agency agency derivatives non agency senior mezzanine interest only securities total non agency total prepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates our agency rmbs portfolio is subject to inherent prepayment risk generally  a decline in interest rates that leads to rising prepayment speeds will cause the market value of our interest only securities to deteriorate  but will cause the market value of our fixed coupon agency pools to increase 
the inverse relationship occurs when interest rates increase and prepayments slow 
we do not expect housing prices to fully stabilize in and this  combined with elevated unemployment rates and housing inventory  leads us to expect that there will not be a significant increase in prepayment speeds in however  given the low level of interest rates  the extension of harp  and the revamped home affordable refinance program  prepayment speeds  particularly due to refinancings  have increased on many rmbs 
these government actions  combined with other potential government programs  could also lead to a further increase in prepayment speeds in rmbs  which could lead to less attractive reinvestment opportunities 
nonetheless  we believe our portfolio approach  including our security selection process  is well positioned to respond to a variety of market scenarios  including an overall faster prepayment environment 
although we are unable to predict the movement in interest rates in and beyond  our blended agency and non agency portfolio strategy is intended to generate attractive yields with a low level of sensitivity to yield curve  prepayments and interest rate cycles 
our portfolio includes agency securities  which includes bonds with explicit prepayment protection  lower loan balances securities collateralized by loans of less than  in principal  high loan to value or ltv ratios securities collateralized by loans with greater or equal to ltv predominantly comprised of making homeownership affordable or mha pools that consist of borrowers who have refinanced through harp  home equity conversion mortgages securities collateralized by reverse mortgages  low fico scores lower credit borrowers  and seasoned bonds reflecting less prepayment risk due to previously experienced high levels of refinancing 
we believe these bond characteristics reduce the prepayment risk to the portfolio 
the following tables provide the carrying value of our agency rmbs portfolio by vintage and prepayment protection as of december  agency rmbs afs agency derivatives total agency rmbs dollars in thousands fixed rate hybrid arms lower loan balances high ltv predominantly mha home equity conversion mortgages low fico seasoned and prior vintages pre pay lock out or penalty based and subsequent vintages and subsequent vintages discount total 
table of contents as of december  agency rmbs afs agency derivatives total agency rmbs dollars in thousands fixed rate hybrid arms lower loan balances high ltv predominantly mha home equity conversion mortgages seasoned and prior vintages pre pay lock out or penalty based and subsequent vintages and subsequent vintages discount total we offset a portion of the agency exposure to prepayment speeds through our non agency portfolio 
our non agency rmbs yields are expected to increase if prepayment rates on such assets exceed our prepayment assumptions 
to the extent that prepayment speeds increase due to macroeconomic factors  we expect to benefit from the ability to recognize the income from the heavily discounted rmbs prices that principally arose from credit or payment default expectations 
the following tables provide discount information on our non agency rmbs portfolio as of december  in thousands principal and interest securities interest only securities total senior mezzanine face value unamortized discount designated credit reserve unamortized net discount amortized cost as of december  in thousands principal and interest securities interest only securities total senior mezzanine face value unamortized discount designated credit reserve unamortized net discount amortized cost credit losses although our agency portfolio is supported by us government agency and federally chartered corporation guarantees of payment of principal and interest  we are exposed to credit risk in our non agency rmbs portfolio 
however  the credit support built into non agency rmbs deal structures is designed to provide a level of protection from potential credit losses for more senior tranches 
in addition  the discounted purchase prices paid on our non agency rmbs assets provide additional insulation from credit losses in the event we receive less than of par on such assets 
we evaluate credit risk on our non agency investments through a comprehensive asset selection process  which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk 
we evaluate credit risk on our non agency investments through a comprehensive asset selection process  which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk  including extensive initial modeling and scenario analysis 
we review on an on going basis our non agency rmbs based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk adjusted returns on such investments and through on going asset surveillance 
at purchase  we estimate the portion of the discount we do not expect to recover and factor that into our expected yield and accretion methodology 
we may also record an other than temporary impairment  or otti  for a portion of our investment in a security to the extent we believe that the 
table of contents amortized cost exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows 
nevertheless  unanticipated credit losses could occur  adversely impacting our operating results 
counterparty exposure and leverage ratio we monitor counterparty exposure in our broker  banking and lending counterparties on a daily basis 
we believe our broker and banking counterparties are well capitalized organizations and we attempt to manage our cash balances across these organizations to reduce our exposure to a single counterparty 
we had entered into repurchase agreements with counterparties as of december   of which had outstanding balances at december  as of december   we had a total consolidated debt to equity ratio of times 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  approximately million of unpledged agency securities and derivatives and million of unpledged non agency securities and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged rmbs of approximately million 
if borrowing rates and collateral requirements change in the near term  we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than a more levered organization 
summary of results of operations and financial condition our reported gaap net income attributable to common stockholders was million per diluted weighted share for the three months ended december  as compared to million per diluted weighted share for the three months ended december  our reported gaap net income attributable to common stockholders was million per diluted weighted share for the year ended december  as compared to million per diluted weighted share for the year ended december  with our accounting treatment for afs securities  unrealized fluctuations in the market values of securities do not impact our gaap or taxable income but are recognized on our balance sheet as a change in stockholder equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as a result of this fair value accounting through stockholder equity  we expect our net income to have less significant fluctuations and result in less gaap to taxable income timing differences  than if the portfolio were accounted as trading instruments 
for the three months ended december  and  net unrealized losses on available for sale securities recognized as other comprehensive loss were million and million  respectively  which resulted in comprehensive income of million for the three months ended december  as compared to million for the three months ended december  for the year ended december   net unrealized gains on available for sale securities recognized as other comprehensive income were million and for the year ended december   net unrealized losses on available for sale securities recognized as other comprehensive loss were million  which resulted in comprehensive income of billion for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  on december   we declared a dividend of per diluted share

table of contents the majority of our non agency rmbs were rated at december  note that credit ratings are based on the par value of the non agency rmbs  whereas the distressed non agency rmbs assets in our portfolio were acquired at a heavily discounted price 
the following table summarizes the credit ratings of our non agency rmbs portfolio as of december  and december  december  december  aaa aa a bbb bb b below b not rated total our non agency rmbs portfolio has approximately doubled since december  as disclosed in note available for sale securities  at fair value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount decreased from to  when focused on principal and interest securities  from december  to december  and our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total face value decreased from to for the same period 
we believe these increases are relatively moderate in context of the portfolio growth 
during this same period  we increased our subprime allocation from to while decreasing our allocation to prime and alt a exposure 
this allocation shift resulted in our average purchase price decreasing from of par to of par as subprime bonds are generally sold at higher discounts to par given their current delinquency performance or expectations of future credit performance 
as we increased our allocation to subprime securities  our average original fico score decreased from to  and our average credit enhancements decreased from to 
the net results of these bond characteristic shifts drive a higher percentage of expected losses in our portfolio and higher designated credit reserves 
a subprime bond may generally be considered higher risk  however  if purchased at a discount that reflects a high expectation of credit losses  it could be viewed less risky than a prime bond  which is subject to unanticipated credit loss performance 
accordingly  we believe our risk profile in owning a heavily discounted subprime bond with known delinquencies affords us the ability to assume a higher percentage of expected credit loss with comparable risk adjusted returns to a less discounted prime bond with a lower percentage of expected credit loss

our principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements  payments of principal and interest we receive on our rmbs portfolio  cash generated from our operating results  and proceeds from capital market transactions 
we typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our repurchase agreements  to purchase our target assets  to make dividend payments on our capital stock  and to fund our operations 
to the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions  we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional rmbs  mortgage loans  and other target assets and for other general corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations  billion of afs  trading securities  equity securities  mortgage loans held for sale  and derivative assets held at fair value  and billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements excludes million in payables to broker counterparties for unsettled security purchases

the debt to equity ratio funding our rmbs afs  residential mortgage loans  and agency derivatives decreased from to as we 
table of contents continued to deploy proceeds from stock offerings 
additionally  during the three months ended december   we sold agency rmbs afs with an amortized cost of billion 
due to higher agency rmbs valuation and inherently tighter spreads during the quarter  we chose to delay deployment of a portion of these proceeds and reduce leverage in order to protect stockholders equity from a near term widening of spreads in the marketplace 
we believe the debt to equity ratio funding our rmbs afs  residential mortgage loans and agency derivatives is the most meaningful debt to equity measure as us treasuries are viewed to be highly liquid in nature 
as of december   we had approximately million of unpledged agency rmbs afs and agency derivatives and million of unpledged non agency securities and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged rmbs of approximately million 
on a daily basis  we monitor and forecast our available  or excess  liquidity 
additionally  we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity 
if borrowing rates and collateral requirements change in the near term  we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than a more leveraged organization 
we have not experienced any restrictions to our funding sources in and have generally experienced an increase in available financing in the rmbs marketplace  including repurchase agreements with maturities greater than one year 
we expect ongoing sources of financing to be primarily repurchase agreements and similar financing arrangements 
we plan to finance our assets with a moderate amount of leverage  the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions 
we may deploy  on a debt to equity basis  up to ten times leverage on our agency rmbs assets 
we also deploy some leverage on our non agency rmbs assets utilizing repurchase agreements as the source of financing 
as of december   we have master repurchase agreements in place with counterparties  the majority of which are us domiciled financial institutions  and we continue to evaluate further counterparties to manage and reduce counterparty risk 
under our repurchase agreements  we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our counterparties lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders  through a margin call  demand additional collateral 
lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements 
this may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages  or may be caused by changes in market interest rates  a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors 
to cover a margin call  we may pledge additional securities or cash 
at maturity  any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance  thereby reducing the amount borrowed 
should the value of our assets suddenly decrease  significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
as of december   a number of our counterparties have been downgraded by ratings agencies  specifically moody 
as these downgrades were expected  we believe the markets had been well prepared for these decisions 
we have not experienced any significant changes to repurchase agreement terms or related financing costs  or made any significant changes to our counterparty exposures as a result of the downgrades

for the three and twelve months ended december   we continued to maintain our repurchase agreement with wells fargo bank 
the repurchase agreement serves as a repurchase facility used from time to time to finance certain of our non agency securities held in our rmbs portfolio with wells fargo 
as of december   borrowings under the wells fargo 
table of contents repurchase agreement were million and unused  uncommitted capacity was million  for an aggregate maximum borrowing capacity of million 
the facility is set to mature on july  once an rmbs is financed by wells fargo in accordance with the repurchase agreement  the financing is committed for the duration of the facility subject to similar pledged collateral and margin requirements as a standard repurchase agreement discussed above 
as part of the repurchase agreement  we are subject to certain financial covenants  which we monitor and comply with on a daily basis 
the extended duration of the facility and its terms provide an additional source to manage our liquidity and interest rate risk 
we also maintained our repurchase agreement with barclays  which serves as a mortgage loan warehouse facility 
this uncommitted facility provides an aggregate maximum borrowing capacity of million  which was increased to million in february  and is set to mature on may   unless extended pursuant to its terms 
as of december   borrowings under the uncommitted facility were million and unused capacity was million 
the facility is collateralized by eligible residential mortgage loans  which are subject to margin call provisions that provide barclays with certain rights when there has been a decline in the market value of the purchased mortgage loans 
we are subject to the following financial covenants under the wells fargo and barclays repurchase agreements  as further detailed by the guaranty agreements we entered into in connection with the repurchase agreements 
the following represents the most restrictive covenant calculations as of december  across both agreements a as of the last business day of each calendar quarter  total indebtedness to net worth must be less than the specified threshold ratio in the repurchase agreement 
as of december   our debt to net worth  as defined  was while our threshold ratio  as defined  was b as of the last business day of each calendar quarter  liquidity must be greater than million and the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash or cash equivalents must be greater than million 
as of december   our liquidity  as defined  was million and our total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  as defined  was million 
c as of the last business day of each calendar quarter  net worth must be greater than billion 
as of december   our net worth  as defined  was billion 
we are also subject to financial covenants in connection with various other repurchase agreements we enter into in the normal course of our business 
we intend to continue to operate in a manner which complies with all of our financial covenants

for the year ended december   operating activities increased our cash balances by approximately million  including million in cash provided by discontinued operations  primarily driven by our financial results for the year 
cash flows from investing activities 
for the year ended december   investing activities reduced our cash balances by approximately billion  including million in cash used in discontinued operations 
the reduction was driven by the increase in our rmbs portfolio as we deployed capital from our common stock offerings 
cash flows from financing activities 
for the year ended december   financing activities increased our cash balance by approximately billion  resulting from the net borrowings under repurchase agreements to fund our afs portfolio as well as net proceeds of billion received from our common stock offerings and exercise of outstanding warrants

recently issued accounting standards refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k inflation substantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation

other matters we intend to conduct our business so as to maintain our exempt status under  and not to become regulated as an investment company for purposes of the act 
if we failed to maintain our exempt status under the act and became regulated as an investment company  our ability to  among other things  use leverage would be substantially reduced and  as a result  we would be unable to conduct our business as described in item business other business regulation of this form k 
accordingly  we monitor our compliance with both the test and the tests of the act in order to maintain our exempt status 
as of december   we determined that we maintained compliance with both the test and the test requirements 
we calculate that at least of our assets were qualified reit assets  as defined in the code for the year ended december  we also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the source of income test and for the source of income test rules for the year ended december  consequently  we met the reit income and asset tests 
we also met

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets  interest rates  liquidity  prepayment speeds and market value while providing an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock 
although we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we believe that risk can be quantified from historical experience and we seek to manage our risk levels in order to earn sufficient compensation to justify the risks we undertake and to maintain capital levels consistent with taking such risks 
to reduce the risks to our portfolio  we employ portfolio wide and security specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations 
prcm advisers risk management tools include software and services licensed or purchased from third parties  in addition to proprietary software and analytical methods developed by pine river 
there can be no guarantee that these tools will protect us from market risks 
interest rate risk interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations  as well as other factors beyond our control 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and related financing obligations 
subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit  we engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques that seek to mitigate the influence of interest rate changes on the values of our assets 
we utilize us treasuries as well as derivative financial instruments  currently limited to interest rate swaps  swaptions  tbas  and  to a certain extent  inverse interest only securities  as of december  to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our portfolio 
we seek to hedge interest rate risk with respect to both the fixed income nature of our assets and the financing of our portfolio 
in hedging interest rates with respect to our fixed income assets  we seek to reduce the risk of losses on the value of our investments that may result from changes in interest rates in the broader markets 
in utilizing interest rate hedges with respect to our financing  we seek to improve risk adjusted returns and  where possible  to obtain a favorable spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing 
we rely on prcm advisers expertise to manage these risks on our behalf 
we implement part of our hedging strategy through capitol  our trs  which is subject to us federal  state and  if applicable  local income tax 
interest rate effect on net interest income our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities 
the costs associated with our borrowings are generally based on prevailing market interest rates 
during a period of rising interest rates  our borrowing costs generally will increase while the yields earned on our existing portfolio of leveraged fixed rate rmbs will remain static 
moreover  interest rates may rise at a faster pace than the yields earned on our leveraged adjustable rate and hybrid rmbs 
both of these factors could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin 
the severity of any such decline would depend on our asset liability composition at the time  as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase 
further  an increase in short term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target assets 
if any of these events happen  we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods  which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
our hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our target assets 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the investment will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
we acquire adjustable rate and hybrid rmbs 
these are assets in which some of the underlying mortgages are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors  which may limit the amount by which the security interest yield may change during any given period 
however  our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements are not subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rate yields on our adjustable rate and hybrid rmbs could effectively be limited by caps 
this issue will be magnified to the extent we acquire adjustable rate and hybrid rmbs that are not based on mortgages that are fully indexed 
in addition  adjustable rate and hybrid rmbs may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
if this happens  we could receive less cash income on such assets than we would need to pay for interest costs on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would harm our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
interest rate mismatch risk we fund the majority of our adjustable rate and hybrid agency rmbs assets with borrowings that are based on libor  while the interest rates on these assets may be indexed to other index rates  such as the one year constant maturity treasury 
table of contents index  or cmt  the monthly treasury average index  or mta  or the th district cost of funds index  or cofi 
accordingly  any increase in libor relative to these indices may result in an increase in our borrowing costs that is not matched by a corresponding increase in the interest earnings on these assets 
any such interest rate index mismatch could adversely affect our profitability  which may negatively impact distributions to our stockholders 
to mitigate interest rate mismatches  we utilize the hedging strategies discussed above 
the following table provides the indices of our variable rate assets as of december  and december   respectively  based on total notional amount of bonds dollars in thousands 
as of december  as of december  index type floating hybrid total index floating hybrid total index cmt libor other total hybrid amounts reflect those assets with greater than months to reset

our analysis of risks is based on prcm advisers and its affiliates experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by prcm advisers may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models 
we use a variety of recognized industry models  as well as proprietary models  to perform sensitivity analyses which are derived from primary assumptions for prepayment rates  discount rates and credit losses 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
the information presented in the following interest sensitivity table projects the potential impact of sudden parallel changes in interest rates on our financial results and financial condition over the next months  based on our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  all changes in value are measured as the change from the december  financial position 
all projected changes in annualized net interest income are measured as the change from the projected annualized net interest income based off current performance returns 
changes in interest rates dollars in thousands bps bps bps bps change in value of financial position available for sale securities  at fair value as a of december  equity trading securities  at fair value as a of december  equity mortgage loans held for sale  at fair value as a of december  equity derivatives  at fair value  net as a of december  equity repurchase agreements as a of december  equity total net assets as a of december  total assets as a of december  equity bps bps bps bps change in annualized net interest income change in net interest income 
table of contents the interest rate sensitivity table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value  which includes the value of swaps and our other derivatives  should interest rates immediately change 
the interest rate sensitivity table presents the estimated impact of interest rates instantaneously rising and basis points  and falling and basis points 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of rmbs for each rate change are calculated based on assumptions  including prepayment speeds  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve  and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are assumed to relate to repurchase agreements  including anticipated interest rates  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement  amount and term of borrowing 
the afs securities  at fair value  included in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table under change in value of financial position were limited to agency rmbs 
due to the significantly discounted prices and underlying credit risks of our non agency rmbs  we believe our non agency rmbs valuation is inherently de sensitized to changes in interest rates 
as such  we cannot project the impact to these financial instruments and have excluded these rmbs from the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
however  these non agency rmbs have been included in the change in annualized net interest income analysis 
certain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table and  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  the analysis utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management judgment and experience 
furthermore  while we generally expect to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity  future purchases and sales of assets could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
the change in annualized net interest income does not include any benefit or detriment from faster or slower prepayment rates on our agency premium rmbs  non agency discount rmbs  and instruments that represent the interest payments but not the principal on a pool of mortgages  or interest only securities 
we anticipate that faster prepayment speeds in lower interest rate scenarios will generate lower realized yields on agency premium and interest only securities and higher realized yields on non agency discount rmbs 
similarly  we anticipate that slower prepayment speeds in higher interest rate scenarios will generate higher realized yields on agency premium and interest only bonds and lower realized yields on non agency discount rmbs 
although we have sought to construct the portfolio to limit the effect of changes in prepayment speeds  there can be no assurance this will actually occur  and the realized yield of the portfolio may be significantly different than we anticipate in changing interest rate scenarios 
given the low interest rates at december   we applied a floor of for all anticipated interest rates included in our assumptions 
because of this floor  we anticipate that any hypothetical interest rate shock decrease would have a limited positive impact on our funding costs  however  because prepayments speeds are unaffected by this floor  we expect that any increase in our prepayment speeds occurring as a result of any interest rate decrease or otherwise could result in an acceleration of our premium amortization on agency and interest only securities purchased at a premium  and accretion of discount on our non agency rmbs purchased at a discount 
as a result  because this floor limits the positive impact of any interest rate decrease on our funding costs  hypothetical interest rate decreases could cause the fair value of our financial instruments and our net interest income to decline 
the information set forth in the interest rate sensitivity table and all related disclosures constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act  and section e of the exchange act 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table 
prepayment risk prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated 
as we receive prepayments of principal on our assets  premiums paid on such assets will be amortized against interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets 
conversely  discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the accretion of purchase discounts  thereby increasing the interest income earned on the assets 
normally  we believe that we will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields  however  no assurances can be given that  should significant prepayments occur  market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds timely reinvested 
market risk market value risk 
our afs securities are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between amortized cost and estimated fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates  market valuation of credit risks  and other factors 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  we would expect the fair value of these securities to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  we would expect the fair value of these securities to increase 
as market volatility increases or liquidity decreases  the fair value of our assets may be adversely impacted 
real estate risk 
rmbs and residential property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including national  regional and local economic conditions  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of 
table of contents housing  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  and retroactive changes to building or similar codes 
decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral for mortgage loans and the potential proceeds available to borrowers to repay the loans  which could cause us to suffer losses on our non agency rmbs investments 
liquidity risk our liquidity risk is principally associated with our financing of long maturity assets with short term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities fall within the guidelines established by our operating policies  maturities are not required to be  nor are they  matched 
should the value of our assets pledged as collateral suddenly decrease  margin calls relating to our repurchase agreements could increase  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
additionally  if one or more of our repurchase agreement counterparties chose not to provide on going funding  our ability to finance would decline or exist at possibly less advantageous terms 
as such  we cannot assure that we will always be able to roll over our repurchase agreements 
see item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in this annual report on form k for further information about our liquidity and capital resource management 
credit risk we believe that our investment strategy will generally keep our risk of credit losses low to moderate 
however  we retain the risk of potential credit losses on all of the loans underlying our non agency rmbs 
with respect to our non agency rmbs that are senior in the credit structure  credit support contained in rmbs deal structures provide a level of protection from losses 
we seek to manage the remaining credit risk through our pre acquisition due diligence process  and by factoring assumed credit losses into the purchase prices we pay for non agency rmbs 
in addition  with respect to any particular target asset  we evaluate relative valuation  supply and demand trends  shape of yield curves  prepayment rates  delinquency and default rates  recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral 
at times  we enter into credit default swaps or other derivative instruments in an attempt to manage our credit risk 
nevertheless  unanticipated credit losses could adversely affect our operating results
