recent regulatory and other developments ohio court decision on may   a subsidiary of the company  ohio neighborhood finance  inc  doing business as cashland cashland  filed a standard collections suit in an elyria municipal court in ohio against rodney scott seeking judgment against mr 
scott in the amount of  which was the amount due under his loan agreement 
cashland s loan was offered under the ohio mortgage loan act omla  which allows for interest at a rate of per annum plus certain loan fees allowed by the statute 
the municipal court held that short term  single payment consumer loans made by cashland are not authorized under the omla  and instead should have been offered under the ohio short term lender law  which was passed by the ohio legislature in for consumer loans with similar terms 
due to a cap on interest and loan fees at an amount that is less than permitted under omla  the company does not offer loans under the ohio short term lender law 
on december   the ohio ninth district court of appeals affirmed the municipal court s ruling in a decision 
although this court decision is only legally binding in the ninth district of ohio  which includes four counties in northern ohio where cashland operates seven stores  other ohio courts may consider this decision 
the company filed an appeal of the ninth district court s decision with the ohio supreme court on january  because it believes that this decision is contrary to the language of the omla  and the ohio supreme court has not yet determined whether it will hear the appeal

uk office of fair trading the company offers consumer loans over the internet in the united kingdom where the company must follow the irresponsible lending guidance of the office of fair trading the oft and the consumer credit act of that was amended by the consumer credit act of collectively  the cca  among other rules and regulations 
in december  the uk parliament passed the financial services act of the act  certain provisions of which take effect on april  and april  the act makes changes to the cca and the financial services and markets act of the fsma and gives the oft the power to suspend consumer credit licenses with immediate effect or from a date specified 
the act also creates the financial conduct authority the fca  which will take over responsibility for regulating consumer credit from the oft in april the fca may regulate consumer credit pursuant to the guidance of the fsma  which includes prescriptive regulations that currently govern the secured credit market and could possibly call for the repeal of the cca or for enabling legislation in the united kingdom 
prescriptive regulations  as contrasted with principles based regulations that currently regulate the lending process in the united kingdom  define what a lender may and may not do with a specific product  similar to us law 
however  the uk coalition government has reserved the option to retain the principles based cca provisions should it conclude that a regulatory model for unsecured consumer credit under the fsma and fca cannot be delivered in an effective regulatory manner 
during the period of transition of regulatory responsibility over consumer credit from the oft to the fca  the oft will continue to fully and rigorously regulate consumer credit  including the short term consumer loan market 
if prescriptive regulations are adopted  the company s compliance costs will be significantly increased 
in addition  in october  the oft issued debt collection guidance that was revised in november this debt collection guidance allows consumer lenders such as the company to debit a customer s account  which includes debits to both bank accounts and debit cards  in a reasonable and non excessive manner 
the company has not experienced a material adverse impact on its business as a result of this guidance

the oft has announced that these inspections could be used to assess a licensee s fitness to hold a consumer credit license and could result in formal enforcement action where appropriate 
the oft is expected to announce its findings during the first quarter of it is unknown if the oft s findings will result in significant changes to the company s operations  business  and prospects 

table of contents consumer financial protection bureau in july  the us congress passed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act  and title x of the dodd frank act created the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb  which regulates consumer financial products and services  including certain short term loans offered by the company 
on january   president obama appointed a director of the cfpb in a recess appointment bypassing senate confirmation 
although there remain doubts about the legality of this appointment and the appointment is subject to legal challenge  the cfpb has begun exercising supervisory review over certain non bank providers of consumer financial products and services  including providers of consumer loans such as the company 
the dodd frank act gave the cfpb  among other things  authority to examine and require registration of providers of consumer financial products and services  including providers of consumer loans such as the company  the authority to adopt rules describing specified acts and practices as being unfair  deceptive or abusive  and hence unlawful  and the authority to impose record keeping obligations 
the company does not currently know the nature and extent of the rules that the cfpb will consider with respect to consumer loan products and services such as those offered by the company or the timeframe in which the cfpb may consider such rules 
although the cfpb does not have the authority to regulate interest rates  it is possible that at some time in the future the cfpb could propose and adopt rules that require certain changes to short term consumer lending products and services  including certain short term loans offered by or through the company  which could make these products and services materially less profitable or even impractical to offer and could force the company to modify or terminate certain of its product offerings 
the cfpb could also adopt rules imposing new and potentially burdensome requirements and limitations with respect to other consumer loan products and services 
any such rules could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition or could make the continuance of all or part of its us consumer loan business impractical or unprofitable 
in furtherance of its regulatory and supervisory powers  the cfpb has the authority to impose monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws  require remediation of practices and pursue enforcement actions

risk factors risks related to the company s business and industry the consumer financial protection bureau could have a significant impact on the company s us consumer loan business 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition on pawn loan fees and service charges and consumer loan fees  allowance for losses on merchandise held for disposition and consumer loans  goodwill  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  empirical data and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents change in accounting policy in the first quarter of  the company changed its accounting policy with respect to its foreign pawn operations to reflect pledged collateral underlying delinquent pawn loans as merchandise held for disposition  net  the proceeds received from the disposition of this collateral as proceeds from disposition of merchandise and the cost basis for this collateral as cost of disposed merchandise in its consolidated financial statements 
the company believes this change  from one generally accepted accounting principle to another generally accepted accounting principle  is preferable because it enhances comparability of its financial statements by reporting financial results associated with its foreign pawn operations in the same manner as the financial results associated with its domestic pawn operations 
the company did not change its accounting policy with respect to its domestic pawn operations  and the change in the company s accounting policy with respect to its foreign pawn operations had no impact on the company s consolidated net revenue or net income previously reported 
the change has been applied retrospectively 
the following tables summarize the impact of the accounting change in the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  and for the years ended december  and  respectively dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  as previously reported as adjusted as previously reported as adjusted consolidated statements of income pawn loan fees and service charges proceeds from disposition of merchandise total revenue disposed merchandise total cost of revenue net revenue consolidated statement of cash flows merchandise other than forfeited prepaid expenses and other assets net cash provided by operating activities pawn loans repaid principal recovered through dispositions of forfeited pawn loans net cash used in investing activities consolidated statement of cash flows supplemental disclosures pawn loans forfeited and transferred to merchandise held for disposition as of december  as previously reported as adjusted consolidated balance sheet merchandise held for disposition  net prepaid expenses and other assets 
table of contents pawn loan fees and service charges pawn loans and pawn loan fees and service charges receivable pawn loans are short term loans made on the pledge of tangible personal property 
the maximum pawn loan amount is generally assessed as a percentage of the personal property s estimated disposition value 
the typical loan term is generally to days and  in many cases  an additional grace period typically to days may be available to the borrower 
a pawn loan is considered delinquent if the customer does not repay or  where allowed by law  renew or extend the loan on or prior to its contractual maturity date plus any applicable grace period 
pawn loan fees and service charges do not accrue on delinquent pawn loans 
when a pawn loan is considered delinquent  any accrued pawn loan fees and service charges are reversed and no additional pawn loan fees and service charges are accrued 
pawn loans written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked for performance 
this empirical data allows the company to analyze the characteristics of its outstanding pawn loan portfolio and assess the collectability of the principal balance in addition to pawn loan fees and service charges 
revenue recognition pawn loan fees and service charges revenue are accrued ratably over the term of the loan for the portion of those pawn loans deemed collectible 
if the future actual performance of the loan portfolio differs significantly positively or negatively from expectations  revenue for the next reporting period would be likewise affected 
at the end of the current year and based on the revenue recognition method described above  the company had accrued million of pawn loan fees and service charges receivable 
assuming the year end accrual of pawn loan fees and service charges revenue was overestimated or underestimated by  pawn loan fees and service charges revenue would decrease or increase by million in and net income attributable to the company would decrease or increase by million  net of taxes 
some or all of the decrease would potentially be mitigated through the profit on the disposition of the related forfeited loan collateral 
any increase would be realized as additional pawn loan fees and service charges revenue 
consumer loans and allowance and liability for estimated losses on consumer loans revenue recognition the company recognizes consumer loan fees for each of the loan products it offers 
consumer loan fees in the consolidated statements of income include interest income  finance charges  cso fees  service charges  draw fees  minimum fees  late fees  nonsufficient funds fees and any other fees or charges permitted by applicable laws and pursuant to the agreement with the borrower 
for short term loans that the company writes  revenue is recognized on an effective yield basis over the term of the loan  and fees are recognized when assessed to the customer 
cso fees  which are fees for services provided through the cso programs  are recognized on an effective yield basis over the term of the loan 
for line of credit accounts  interest is recognized on an effective yield basis over the term of the loan  and fees are recognized when assessed to the customer 
for installment loans  revenue is recognized on an effective yield basis over the term of the loan and fees are recognized when assessed to the customer 
unpaid and accrued interest and fees are included in consumer loans  net in the consolidated balance sheets 
current and delinquent consumer loans the company classifies its consumer loans as either current or delinquent 
short term loans are considered delinquent when payment of an amount due is not made as of the due date 
if a line of credit account or installment loan customer misses one payment  that payment is considered delinquent 
if a line of credit account or installment loan customer does not make two consecutive payments  the entire account or loan is classified as delinquent 
the company allows for normal payment processing time before considering a loan delinquent but does not provide for any additional grace period 
where permitted by law  a customer may choose to renew a short term loan contract or extend the due date on a short term loan before it is considered delinquent by agreeing to pay the current finance charge for the right to make a later payment of the outstanding principal balance plus an additional finance charge 
in addition  in some instances  customers agree to repay a 
table of contents new short term loan in two or three payments  and in these cases the company considers the obligation to make the first payment a new loan and the obligation to make the second and third payments renewals or extensions of that loan because the customer pays the finance charge due at the time of each payment  similar to a loan that has been renewed or extended 
all references to renewals include both renewals and extensions made by customers to their existing short term loans 
if a short term loan is renewed  but the customer fails to pay that loan s current finance charge as of the due date  the unpaid finance charge is classified as delinquent 
the company generally does not accrue interest on delinquent consumer loans and does not resume accrual of interest unless a loan is returned to current status 
delinquent consumer loans may not be renewed  and if  during its attempt to collect on a delinquent consumer loan  the company allows additional time for payment through a payment plan or a promise to pay  it is still considered delinquent 
all payments received are first applied against accrued but unpaid interest and fees and then against the principal balance of the loan 
allowance and liability for estimated losses on consumer loans the company monitors the performance of its consumer loan portfolio and maintains either an allowance or liability for estimated losses on consumer loans including fees and interest at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance for losses on the company s owned consumer loans reduces the outstanding loan balance in the consolidated balance sheets 
the liability for estimated losses related to loans guaranteed under the cso programs  which approximates the fair value of the liability  is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
in determining the allowance or liability for estimated losses on consumer loans  the company applies a documented systematic methodology 
in calculating the allowance or liability for loan losses  outstanding loans are divided into discrete groups of short term loans  line of credit accounts and installment loans and are analyzed as current or delinquent 
increases in either the allowance or the liability  net of charge offs and recoveries  are recorded as a consumer loan loss provision in the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance or liability for short term loans classified as current is based on historical loss rates adjusted for recent default trends for current loans 
during the fourth quarter of  in order to better reflect portfolio trends  management revised the estimation process for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance and liability for estimated losses on consumer loans 
this change is described below and did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
for delinquent short term loans  the allowance or liability is based on a six month rolling average of loss rates by stage of collection 
for line of credit and installment loan portfolios  the company generally uses a migration analysis to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance or liability calculation under the migration analysis is based on historical charge off experience and the loss emergence period  which represents the average amount of time between the first occurrence of a loss event to the charge off of a loan 
the factors the company considers to assess the adequacy of the allowance or liability include past due performance  historical behavior of monthly vintages  underwriting changes and recent trends in delinquency in the migration analysis 
the company fully reserves and generally charges off consumer loans once the loan or a portion of the loan has been classified as delinquent for consecutive days 
if a loan is deemed uncollectible before it is fully reserved  it is charged off at that point 
consumer loans classified as delinquent generally have an age of one to days from the date any portion of the loan became delinquent  as defined above 
recoveries on loans previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance when collected 

table of contents as of december   the allowance for losses on consumer loans was million and the liability for estimated losses on third party lender owned consumer loans guaranteed by the company was million  in aggregate representing of the combined consumer loan portfolio 
for the year ended december   the consumer loan loss provision for the combined consumer loan portfolio was million and reflects of gross combined consumer loans written and renewed by the company and third party lenders 
if the loss provision increased or decreased by  or million  from levels a change in the percentage of gross combined consumer loans written and renewed  net income attributable to the company would decrease or increase by million  net of taxes  for  assuming the same volume of consumer loans written and renewed in merchandise held for disposition merchandise held for disposition consists primarily of forfeited collateral from pawn loans not repaid and merchandise that is purchased directly from customers or from third parties 
the carrying value of the forfeited collateral and other merchandise held for disposition is stated at the lower of cost which is the cost basis in the loan or the amount paid for purchased merchandise or fair value 
with respect to the company s foreign pawn operations  collateral underlying unredeemed pawn loans is not owned by the company  however  the company assumes the risk of loss on such collateral and is solely responsible for its care and disposition 
accordingly  the company classifies these domestic and foreign assets as merchandise held for disposition  net in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company provides an allowance for returns and an allowance for valuation based on management s evaluation of the current trends in performance  characteristics of the merchandise and historical shrinkage rates 
because the company s pawn loans are made without recourse to the borrower  the company does not investigate or rely upon the borrower s creditworthiness  but instead bases its lending decision on an evaluation of the pledged personal property 
the amount financed is typically based on a percentage of the pledged personal property s estimated disposition value 
the company uses numerous sources in determining an item s estimated disposition value  including the company s automated product valuation system as well as catalogs  blue books  newspapers  internet research and previous disposition experience 
the company performs a physical count of its merchandise in each location on multiple occasions on a cyclical basis and reviews the composition of inventory by category and age in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
in accordance with asc  goodwill subsequent measurement  the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually as of june and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company uses the income approach to complete its annual goodwill assessment 
the income approach uses future cash flows and estimated terminal values for each of the company s reporting units that are discounted using a market participant perspective to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  which is then compared to the carrying value of that reporting unit to determine if there is impairment 
the income approach includes assumptions about revenue growth rates  operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint 
the company completed its annual assessment of goodwill as of june  and determined that the fair value is significantly in excess of carrying value  and  as a result  no impairment existed at that date
