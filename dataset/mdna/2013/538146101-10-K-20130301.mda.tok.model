financial overview for the three and twelve months ended december  financial overview of the three and twelve months ended december  compared to the comparable periods in are as follows revenue increased and to million and million in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively from million and million in the comparable periods in revenue from our business segment increased and to million and million in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively from million and million in the comparable periods in gross profit margin decreased to from in the three months ended december   from the comparable period in gross profit margin increased to from in the twelve months ended december   from the comparable period in operating expenses increased and to million and million in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively from million and million in the comparable periods in financial income was  and  in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
we incurred financial expense of  and  in the comparable periods in financial income and expense is the result of currency rate fluctuations associated with the exchange rate movement of the us dollar against the new israeli shekel 
net income decreased to million in the three months ended december  from net income of million for the three months ended december  net income decreased to million in the twelve months ended december  from net income of million for the twelve months ended december  bookings increased and to million and million in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  from million and million in the comparable periods in we include in our bookings metrics new contractual commitments from either new or existing midmarket and or enterprise customers for recurring subscription based fees  but exclude from such amounts non recurring fees such as one time implementation costs or one time consulting fees 
the bookings metric generally does not include or represent usage based and or pay for performance based contracts  month to month contracts or transaction based services 
accordingly  while we believe that bookings is a relevant metric in providing management with insight into certain recent activity in our business  there is no assurance that bookings amounts will be recognized as revenue in future periods  based on our revenue recognition policy  potential customer cancelations  delays in implementations or otherwise 
average deal size for new bookings in the three months ended december  was  with average deal size for new customers of  and average deal size for existing customers requesting additional products or expanded access to current products of  similar to our bookings metric  average deal size generally represents new contractual arrangements with committed subscription or base fees from new or existing mid market or enterprise customers  and does not capture usage and or pay for performance based contracts or fees 
management uses average deal size  being a subset of bookings  as a relevant metric in providing management with insight into certain recent activity in our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of the liveperson services 
because we provide our application as a service  we follow the provisions of asc s  revenue recognition and asc  revenue recognition with multiple element arrangements 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by type of service  the level of customer usage and website traffic  and in some cases  the number of orders placed via our online engagement solutions 
for certain of our larger customers  we may provide call center labor through an arrangement with one or more of several qualified vendors 
for most of these customers  we pass the fee we incur with the labor provider and our fee for the hosted services through to our customers in the form of a fixed fee for each order placed via our online engagement solutions 
for these pay for performance pfp arrangements  we recognize revenue net of the labor provider s fee in accordance with asc  principal agent considerations  due primarily to the fact that the call center labor vendor is the primary obligor with respect to the labor services provided 
additionally  we perform as an agent without risk of loss for collection and do not bear inventory risk with respect to the outsourced labor services 
finally  we do not provide any part of the labor services  have no latitude in establishing prices for the labor services and generally do not have discretion in selecting the vendor 
the majority of our larger customers also pay a professional services fee related to implementation 
we defer these implementation fees and associated direct costs and recognize them ratably over the expected term of the customer relationship upon commencement of the hosting services 
we may also charge professional service fees related to additional training  business consulting and analysis in support of the liveperson services 
we also sell certain of the liveperson services directly via internet download 
these services are marketed as liveperson pro and liveperson contact center for small and mid sized businesses smbs  and are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk  subject to the merchant bank s right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions 
sales of liveperson pro and liveperson contact center may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact that is typically required for traditional direct sales 
we recognize monthly service revenue based upon the fee charged for the liveperson services  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  no significant company obligations remain  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the amount of fees to be paid is fixed or determinable 
our service agreements typically have twelve month terms and are terminable or may terminate upon to days notice without penalty 
when professional service fees add value to the customer on a standalone basis  we recognize professional service fees upon completion and customer acceptance in accordance with fasb accounting standards update this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
if a professional services arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the fees  and the related labor costs  ratably over a period of months  representing our current estimate of the term of the customer relationship 
for revenue generated from online transactions between experts and users  we recognize revenue net of expert fees in accordance with asc  principal agent considerations  due primarily to the fact that the expert is the primary obligor 
additionally  we perform as an agent without any risk of loss for collection  and are not involved in selecting the expert or establishing the expert s fee 
we collect a fee from the consumer and retain a portion of the fee  and then remit the balance to the expert 
revenue from these transactions is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  no significant company obligations remain  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the amount of fees to be paid is fixed or determinable 
stock based compensation we follow asc  stock compensation  which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
asc requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
accounts receivable our customers are located primarily in the united states 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition except for customers who purchase the liveperson services by credit card via internet download and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable  although they may change in the future 
if there is a deterioration of a customer s credit worthiness or actual write offs are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected 
although our large number of customers limits our concentration of credit risk we do have several large customers 
if we experience a significant write off from one of these large customers  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
no single customer accounted for or exceeded of our total revenue in  and one customer accounted for approximately and of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  to approximately  principally due to an increase in the proportion of our receivables due from customers with greater credit risk 
a large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles 
goodwill in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would reduce the fair value below its carrying amount 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 
if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying value including unrecognized intangible assets than it is necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
in the third quarter of  we determined that it is not more likely that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying amount 
accordingly  we did not perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with codification subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other  general intangibles other than goodwill 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of goodwill  intangibles  stock based compensation  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  accounts receivable  the expected term of a customer relationship  accruals and other factors 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
this asu is intended to provide enhanced disclosures that will enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity s financial position 
this includes the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with an entity s recognized assets and recognized liabilities within the scope of this update 
the amendments require enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in accordance with either section or section or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement  irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either section or section an entity is required to apply this amendment for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
asu no 
relates specifically to disclosures  it will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of the liveperson services 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by service and customer usage 
the majority of our larger customers also pay a professional services fee related to implementation 
a large proportion of our revenue from new customers comes from large corporations 
these companies typically have more significant implementation requirements and more stringent data security standards 
such customers also have more sophisticated data analysis and performance reporting requirements  and are likely to engage our professional services organization to provide such analysis and reporting on a recurring basis

we cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  when needed  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing  we may be required to further reduce the scope of our planned sales and marketing and product development efforts  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we may require additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion  to develop new or enhanced services or products or to invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
contractual obligations and commitments we do not have any special purposes entities  and other than operating leases  which are described below we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we lease facilities and certain equipment under agreements accounted for as operating leases 
these leases generally require us to pay all executory costs such as maintenance and insurance 
rental expense for operating leases for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   our principal commitments were approximately million under various operating leases  of which approximately million is due in we currently expect that our principal commitments for the year ending december  will not exceed million in the aggregate 
our contractual obligations at december  are summarized as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases     total      capital expenditures through december   we have spent approximately million related to the build out and expansion of our co location facilities in the us and europe to host the liveperson and consumer services 
though we expect to incur additional costs in related to the continued expansion of our co location facilities and office build outs to support our growth  our total capital expenditures are not currently expected to exceed million in we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures 
indemnifications we enter into service and license agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to some of these agreements  we agree to indemnify certain customers from and against certain types of claims and losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of using our products 
we also have agreements whereby our executive officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
currently  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency rate fluctuations as a result of the expanding scope of our israeli operations  our currency rate fluctuation risk associated with the exchange rate movement of the us dollar against the new israeli shekel nis has increased 
for the year ended december   the u 
s dollar depreciated approximately as compared to the nis 
for the year ended december   expenses generated by our israeli operations totaled approximately million 
we do not currently hedge our foreign currency risk exposure 
we actively monitor the movement of the us dollar against the nis  uk pound and aus dollar and have considered the use of financial instruments  including but not limited to derivative financial instruments  which could mitigate such risk 
if we determine that our risk of exposure materially exceeds the potential cost of derivative financial instruments  we may in the future enter in to these types of investments 
the functional currency of our wholly owned israeli subsidiaries  liveperson ltd 
formerly humanclick ltd 
and kasamba ltd  is the us dollar  the functional currency of our operations in the united kingdom is the uk pound and the functional currency of our operations in australia is the australian dollar 
collection risk our accounts receivable are subject  in the normal course of business  to collection risks 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of collection risks 
during  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts  to approximately  principally due to an increase in the proportion of our receivables due from customers with greater credit risk 
a large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles 
during  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts  to approximately  principally due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales and  to a lesser extent  to an increase in the proportion of our receivables due from customers with greater credit risk 
we wrote off approximately  of previously reserved accounts  leaving a net allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  a large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles 
interest rate risk our investments consist of cash and cash equivalents 
therefore  changes in the market s interest rates do not affect in any material respect the value of the investments as recorded by us
