item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors 
see the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements set forth at the beginning of part i of the annual report on form k 
fiscal a review of this past year in fiscal  zumiez achieved record sales and earnings levels and continued to build on the momentum we had seen in fiscal during the year  we continued to make strategic investments that we believe will reap long term benefits focused on enhancing the customer experience across multiple sales channels  domestic and international growth and on our people and infrastructure aimed at improving decision making and product speed to market 
in july  we completed the acquisition of blue tomato 
blue tomato is a multi channel retailer 
table of contents for board sports and related apparel and footwear in the european marketplace 
the blue tomato acquisition represents a presence in the european action sports market with an established brand identity and operational philosophies that are strategically aligned with zumiez 
the following table shows net sales  operating profit and margin and diluted earnings per share growth for fiscal compared to fiscal the fiscal results include million in costs associated with the acquisition of blue tomato  including one time acquisition costs  amortization of intangible assets and the costs associated with the future incentive payments related to the transaction as well as million in charges for the relocation of our home office and ecommerce fulfillment center fiscal year ended february  january  change net sales in thousands operating profit in thousands operating margin diluted earnings per share the fiscal year ended february  consisted of weeks versus weeks in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in net sales reflected a comparable store sales increase of for fiscal as well as the net addition of stores new or acquired stores offset by five store closures  which includes the acquisition of blue tomato during the second quarter of fiscal the increase in comparable stores sales was primarily driven by an increase in dollars per transaction partially offset by a decrease in comparable store transactions 
dollars per transaction increased primarily due to an increase in average unit retail  partially offset by a decline in units per transaction 
these sales results were achieved with record product margins  demonstrating the strength of our distinctive product offering and the unique customer experience our store associates provide 
as a result of our continued focus on managing our cost structure  these sales results translated into strong operating profit and diluted earnings per share growth despite the impact of charges related to the acquisition costs associated with blue tomato and relocation of our home office and ecommerce fulfillment center 
while the results of fiscal were positive  the back half of the year trended downward  particularly in the fourth quarter when same store sales decreased 
contributing to these results were category challenges as we faced headwinds  such as footwear and snow hardgoods and outerwear 
fiscal a look at the upcoming year as we enter fiscal  we continue to face some of the challenges we encountered during the second half of fiscal in addition  we believe that consumers continue to face challenging economic conditions and uncertainty both domestically and globally that cause concern in the retail environment and lead us to be cautious in our outlook for the coming year 
however  regardless of the macro economic landscape  we believe that we are well positioned to perform well relative to other retailers by staying true to what makes us unique while continuing to make return based investments 
long term we aim to grow sales annually and grow operating profit at a faster rate than sales by focusing on our growth initiatives while managing our cost structure 
our primary growth vehicles are initiatives that drive comparable store sales gains  opening high return stores  ecommerce penetration  and international growth 
table of contents in fiscal  we expect total sales to increase driven by an increase in comparable store sales  the opening of approximately new stores  including approximately stores through international expansion in canada and europe  increased sales from our ecommerce channel and a full year of sales attributed to the blue tomato acquisition 
if we achieve our sales projections  we expect earnings will increase 
we will make further investments in people and infrastructure in fiscal  building on the progress we have made through fiscal  primarily focused on the development of our omni channel sales strategies and our international growth 
we anticipate inventory levels per square foot to grow slightly 
we expect our cash  short term investments and working capital to increase  and do not anticipate any new borrowings during the year 
general net sales constitute gross sales net of actual and estimated returns  deductions for promotions and shipping revenue 
net sales include our in store sales and our ecommerce sales 
we record the sale of gift cards as a current liability and recognize revenue when a customer redeems a gift card 
additionally  the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed gift card breakage is recognized in net sales after months  at which time the likelihood of redemption is considered remote based on our historical redemption data 
we report comparable store sales based on net sales beginning on the first anniversary of the first day of operation of a new store or ecommerce business 
we operate a sales strategy that integrates our stores with our ecommerce platform 
there is significant interaction between our in store sales and our ecommerce sales channels and we believe that they are utilized in tandem to serve our customers 
therefore  our comparable store sales also include our ecommerce sales 
changes in our comparable store sales between two periods are based on net sales of in store or ecommerce businesses which were in operation during both of the two periods being compared and  if a in store or ecommerce business is included in the calculation of comparable store sales for only a portion of one of the two periods being compared  then that in store or ecommerce business is included in the calculation for only the comparable portion of the other period 
any change in square footage of an existing comparable store  including remodels and relocations  does not eliminate that store from inclusion in the calculation of comparable store sales 
any store or ecommerce business that we acquire will be included in the calculation of comparable store sales after the first anniversary of the acquisition date 
as such  blue tomato results will not be included in the calculation of comparable store sales until july there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other apparel retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 
as a result  data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers 
cost of goods sold consists of branded merchandise costs and our private label merchandise costs including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs 
our cost of goods sold also includes shrinkage  buying  occupancy  ecommerce fulfillment  distribution and warehousing costs including associated depreciation and freight costs for store merchandise transfers 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of goods sold 
cash consideration received from vendors  is reported as a reduction of cost of goods sold if the inventory has sold  a reduction of the carrying value of the inventory if the inventory is still on hand  or a reduction of selling  general and administrative expense if the amounts are reimbursements of specific  incremental and identifiable costs of selling the vendors products 
with respect to the freight component of our ecommerce sales  amounts billed to our customers are included in net sales and the related freight cost is charged to cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of store personnel wages and benefits  administrative staff and infrastructure expenses  freight costs for merchandise shipments from the distribution centers to the stores  store supplies  depreciation on fixed assets at our home office and stores  facility expenses and training  advertising and marketing costs 
credit card fees  insurance  public company expenses  legal expenses  amortization of intangibles and other miscellaneous operating costs are also included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which we consider key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales 
as previously described in detail under the caption general  comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores and ecommerce businesses open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
we consider comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll and store occupancy 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  operating profit  cash and working capital 
gross profit 
gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating profit 
we view operating profit as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating profit are comparable store sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses and our level of capital expenditures affecting depreciation expense 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with us gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements found in part iv item of this form k 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions valuation of merchandise inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value through the establishment of write down and inventory loss reserves 
our write down reserve represents the excess of the carrying value over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sales or other disposal of the inventory 
write downs establish a new cost basis for our inventory 
subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously recorded write downs or an increase in that newly established cost basis 
our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses shrinkage reserve that have occurred since the last physical inventory dates 
our write down reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on the current rate of sales  the age and profitability of inventory and other factors 
our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including historical percentages that can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our write down and shrinkage reserves in the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a decrease in ultimate sales price at february  would have decreased net income by million in fiscal a increase in actual physical inventory shrinkage reserved at february  would have decreased net income by million in fiscal fixed assets we review the carrying value of our fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing the projected discounted cash flow of the asset to the asset carrying value 
declines in projected cash flow of the assets could result in impairment 
the actual economic lives of our fixed assets may be different from our estimated useful lives  thereby resulting in a different carrying value 
these evaluations could result in a change in the depreciable lives of these assets and therefore our depreciation expense in future periods 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting future sales  gross profit and operating expenses 
our fixed assets accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make estimates with respect to the useful lives of our fixed assets that we believe are reasonable 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate fixed asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
although management believes that the current useful lives estimates assigned to our fixed assets are reasonable  factors could cause us to change our estimates  thus affecting the future calculation of depreciation 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon purchase at our retail store locations 
for our ecommerce sales  revenue is recognized upon estimated delivery to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for promotions 
revenue is not recorded on the sale of gift cards 
we record the sale of gift cards as a current liability and recognize revenue when a customer redeems a gift card 
additionally  an estimate of the portion of gift cards that is not expected to be redeemed gift card breakage is recognized in net sales after months  at which time the likelihood of redemption is considered remote based on our historical redemption data 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions regarding future sales returns and the amount and timing of gift cards projected to be redeemed by gift card recipients 
our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns and gift cards to be redeemed is based primarily on historical transaction experience 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to measure future sales returns or recognize revenue for our gift card program in the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a increase in our sales return reserve at february  would have decreased net income by million in fiscal a increase in our unredeemed gift card breakage life at february  would have decreased net income by million in fiscal stock based compensation we maintain the zumiez inc equity incentive plan under which restricted stock and non qualified stock options have been granted to employees and non employee directors 
we determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards based on the closing market price of our stock on the grant date 
in determining the fair value of our stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated fair value of stock based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the calculation of stock based compensation expense requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest and to determine the fair value of our stock option awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating future employee turnover rates and the inputs to the black scholes option pricing model  including expected term 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect our stock based compensation expense 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  income taxes are estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on the consolidated balance sheets 
valuation allowances may be established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
for example  our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax  accounting and other laws  regulations  principles and interpretations 
although management believes that the income tax related judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
upon income tax audit  any unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
accounting for contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  insurance  regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable  or if an estimate is not determinable  we provide disclosure of a material claim or contingency in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our claims and contingencies  including determining the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable 
the estimated accruals for claims and contingencies are made based on the best information available  which can be highly subjective 
although management believes that the contingencies related judgments and estimates are reasonable  our accrual for claims and contingencies could fluctuate as additional information becomes known  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
additionally  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  or as indicators of impairment are present 
we have an option to first assess qualitative factors for our goodwill impairment analysis to determine whether it is necessary to perform the qualitative test based on whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we chose not to perform the quantitative test  or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  we perform a quantitative two step impairment test 
we test our indefinite lived assets by estimating the fair value of the asset and comparing that to the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded for the amount that carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
the fair value of the trade names and trademarks is determined using the relief from royalty method  which requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales  expenses  discount rates and royalty rates 
our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions in the qualitative assessment of relevant events and circumstances and estimating the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets  including estimating future cash flows 
these calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate economic factors and the profitability of future business operations and if necessary  the fair value of a reporting units assets and liabilities 
further  our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
based on the results of our annual impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  no impairment was recorded 
we believe based on our assessment discussed above our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not at risk of impairment 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions or there are significant changes in any of these estimates  projections and assumptions it could have a material effect on the fair value of these assets in future measurement periods and result in an impairment which could materially affect our results of operations 
future incentive payments in conjunction with our acquisition of blue tomato in july  there is the possibility of future incentive payments to the sellers of blue tomato in an aggregate amount of up to million euros million  using the exchange rate as of february  to the extent that certain financial metrics are met for the fiscal year ending april  and the sellers remain employed with blue tomato through april  of the million euros future incentive payments  million euros million is payable in cash  while million euros million is payable in shares of our common stock 
we estimate future incentive payments based on internal projections of future blue tomato financial performance 
our future incentive payments calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future blue tomato performance  including forecasting future sales  gross profit  operating expenses  number of new stores and capital expenditures 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates related to the future incentive payments are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material

table of contents net income net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal our effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal seasonality and quarterly results as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences 
as a result  we have historically experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating results 
our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  while the back to school and winter holiday periods in our third and fourth fiscal quarters historically have accounted for the largest percentage of our annual net sales 
quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of store openings and the relative proportion of our new stores to mature stores  fashion trends and changes in consumer preferences  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  changes in merchandise mix  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions  competition and weather conditions 
the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data for the last two fiscal years 
the unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and includes all adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
this information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the operating results for any fiscal quarter are not indicative of the operating results for a full fiscal year or for any future period and there can be no assurance that any trend reflected in such results will continue in the future

table of contents all quarters in the fiscal year ended january  are week periods ended april   july   october  and january  liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are for operational expenditures  inventory purchases and capital investments  including new stores  store remodels  store relocations  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements 
additionally  we may use cash for the repurchase of our common stock 
historically  our main source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash  cash equivalents  current marketable securities and receivables  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale  while we typically have longer payment terms with our vendors 
at february  and january   cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities were million and million 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  was million at the end of fiscal  a decrease of from million at the end of fiscal the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities and working capital in fiscal were due primarily to the costs associated with the acquisition of blue tomato for net of cash acquired  capital expenditures of million due primarily to the opening of new stores in fiscal and the construction of our new home office building in lynnwood  washington and the million repurchase of common stock  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of million 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands fiscal year ended february  january  january  total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers  offset by cash payments we make for inventory  employee compensation  store occupancy expenses and other operational expenditures 
cash received from our customers generally corresponds to our net sales 
because our customers primarily use credit cards or cash to buy from us  our receivables from customers settle quickly 
changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income  which is impacted by changes to non cash items such as depreciation  amortization and accretion  deferred taxes  excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and changes to the components of working capital 

table of contents investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to million cash paid net of cash acquired for the acquisition of blue tomato and million of capital expenditures primarily for new store openings  existing store remodels or relocations and the construction of our new home office building in lynnwood  washington  partially offset by million in net sales of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to net purchases of marketable securities of million and capital expenditures of million for new store openings and existing store remodels or relocations 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures of million for new store openings  existing store remodels or relocations and the purchase of our new distribution center in corona  california and net purchases of marketable securities of million

net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and was million and million related to proceeds from stock based compensation exercises and related tax benefits 
sources of liquidity our most significant sources of liquidity continue to be funds generated by operating activities  available cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities 
we expect these sources of liquidity and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash requirements for operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
beyond this time frame  if cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current shareholders 
we maintain a secured credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which provides us with a secured revolving credit facility until september  of up to million  which  pursuant to an accordion feature  may be increased to million at our discretion 
the secured revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of a standby letter of credit in an amount not to exceed million outstanding at any time and with a term not to exceed days 
the commercial line of credit provides for the issuance of a commercial letter of credit in an amount not to exceed million and with terms not to exceed days 
the amount of borrowings available at any time under our secured revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at that time 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the secured revolving credit facility at february  and january  we had open commercial letters of credit outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility of million at february  and million at january  the secured revolving credit facility bears interest at the daily one month libor rate plus 
additionally  in conjunction with our acquisition of blue tomato  we assumed million in long term debt  which relates to amounts borrowed to fund operations 
at february   the amount of borrowings under this debt was million 
capital expenditures our capital requirements include construction and fixture costs related to the opening of new stores and remodel and relocation expenditures for existing stores 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of new store openings  the availability of suitable locations for new stores and the nature of 
table of contents arrangements negotiated with landlords 
in that regard  our net investment to open a new store has varied significantly in the past due to a number of factors  including the geographic location and size of the new store  and is likely to vary significantly in the future 
during fiscal  we spent million on capital expenditures  which consisted of million of costs related to investment in new stores and remodeled or relocated stores  million of costs associated with the construction of our new home office building in lynnwood  washington and million in other improvements 
during fiscal  we spent million on capital expenditures  which consisted of million of costs related to investment in new stores and remodeled or relocated stores  million of costs associated with the construction of our new home office building in lynnwood  washington and million in other improvements 
during fiscal  we spent million on capital expenditures  which consisted of million related to investment in new stores and three remodeled or relocated stores  the acquisition and build out costs of our new distribution center in corona  california of million  the acquisition costs of million for land for our new home office in lynnwood  washington and million in other improvements 
in fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures  a majority of which will relate to leasehold improvements and fixtures for the approximately new stores we plan to open in fiscal and remodels or relocations of existing stores 
there can be no assurance that the number of stores that we actually open in fiscal will not be different from the number of stores we plan to open  or that actual fiscal capital expenditures will not differ from this expected amount 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the fiscal year ended february   with the exception of the long term debt that we assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of blue tomato
