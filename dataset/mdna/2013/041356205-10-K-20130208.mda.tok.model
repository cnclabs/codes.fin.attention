item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview arlington asset investment corp 
is a principal investment firm that acquires and holds mortgage related and other assets 
we acquire residential mortgage backed securities mbs  either issued by us government agencies or guaranteed as to principal and interest by us government agencies or us government sponsored entities agency backed mbs 
we also acquire mbs issued by private organizations private label mbs subject to maintaining our exemption from regulation as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended act 
when we use the terms arlington asset  aaic  we us our and the company  we mean arlington asset investment corp 
and its consolidated subsidiaries 
we are a virginia corporation and taxed as a c corporation for federal income tax purposes 
we operate primarily in the united states 
factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition our business is materially affected by a variety of industry and economic factors  including conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions  changes in interest rates and prepayment rates  actions taken by the us federal reserve and the us treasury  changes in laws and regulations and industry practices  actions taken by ratings agencies with respect to the us s credit rating  and other market developments 
adverse market conditions and actions by governmental authorities could adversely affect our business in many ways  including but not limited to making it more difficult for us to analyze our investment portfolio  adversely affecting our ability to maintain targeted amounts of leverage on our mbs portfolio and successfully implement our hedging strategy  and limiting our ability to follow our current investment and financing strategies 
while uncertain  these potentially adverse market conditions and actions by governmental authorities may adversely affect our liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
we have been and will continue to evaluate the potential impact of recent government actions  including developments relating to foreclosure suspensions and affidavit errors and various state and federal government actions affecting the market price of mbs and related derivative securities 
while it is predictably difficult to foresee the short and long term impact of foreclosure issues given all the uncertainties  at this time  we do not anticipate that the current foreclosure issues will have a material negative effect on our overall position and results of operations 
for further discussions on how market conditions and government actions may adversely affect our business  see item a risk factors 
our mbs portfolio is affected by general us residential real estate market conditions and the overall us economic environment 
in particular  our mbs strategy and the performance of our mbs portfolio is influenced by the specific characteristics of these markets  including prepayment rates  credit losses  interest rates and the interest rate yield curve 
our results of operations with respect to our mbs portfolio primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our interest income and the amount and cost of borrowings we may obtain by pledging our investment portfolio as collateral for the borrowings 
our interest income  which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in prepayment speeds of the securities in our mbs portfolio 
our borrowing cost varies based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount we can borrow which is generally based on the fair value of the mbs portfolio and the advance rate the lenders are willing to lend against the collateral provided 
the payment of principal and interest on the agency backed mbs that we acquire and hold is guaranteed by the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
the payment of principal and interest on agency backed mbs issued by freddie mac or fannie mae is not guaranteed by the us government 
any failure to honor its guarantee of agency backed mbs by freddie mac or fannie mae or any downgrade of securities issued by freddie mac or fannie mae by the rating agencies could cause a significant decline in the value of and cash flow from any agency backed mbs we own that are guaranteed by such entity 

table of contents current market conditions and trends on october   the federal housing finance authority fhfa released its white paper entitled building a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market fhfa white paper 
this release follows upon the fhfa february  strategic plan for enterprise conservatorships  which set forth three goals for the next phase of the fannie mae and freddie mac conservatorships 
these three goals are to i build a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market  ii gradually contract fannie mae and freddie mac presence in the marketplace while simplifying and shrinking their operations  and iii maintain foreclosure prevention activities and credit availability for new and refinanced mortgages 
the fhfa white paper proposes a new infrastructure for fannie mae and freddie mac that has two basic goals 
the first goal is to replace the current  outdated infrastructures of fannie mae and freddie mac with a common  more efficient infrastructure that aligns the standards and practices of the two entities  beginning with core functions performed by both entities such as issuance  master servicing  bond administration  collateral management and data integration 
the second goal is to establish an operating framework for fannie mae and freddie mac that is consistent with the progress of housing finance reform and encourages and accommodates the increased participation of private capital in assuming credit risk associated with the secondary mortgage market 
the fhfa recognizes that there are a number of impediments to their goals which may or may not be surmountable  such as the absence of any significant secondary mortgage market mechanisms beyond fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae  and that their proposals are in the formative stages 
as a result  it is unclear if the proposals will be enacted 
if such proposals are enacted  it is unclear how closely what is enacted will resemble the proposals from the fhfa white paper or what the effects of the enactment will be 
on september   the us federal reserve announced a third round of quantitative easing qe  which is an open ended program designed to expand the us federal reserve s holdings of long term securities by purchasing an additional billion of agency backed mbs per month until key economic indicators  such as the unemployment rate  show signs of improvement 
when combined with programs to extend the average maturity of the us federal reserve s holdings of securities  known as operation twist and described below  and reinvest principal and interest payments from the us federal reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency backed mbs into agency backed mbs  qe was expected to increase the us federal reserve s holdings of long term securities by billion each month through the end of the us federal reserve also announced that it would keep the target range for the federal funds rate between zero and through at least mid  which is six months longer than previously expected 
the us federal reserve provided further guidance to the market in december by stating that it intended to keep the federal funds rate close to zero while the unemployment rate is above and as long as inflation does not rise above 
in december  the us federal reserve also announced that it would initially begin buying billion of long term treasury bonds each month and noted that such amount may increase in the future 
this bond purchase program will replace the existing program known as operation twist  in which the us federal reserve repurchased approximately billion of long term treasury bonds each month and sold approximately the same amount of short term treasury bonds 
the immediate impact of the announcement of qe was an increase in agency backed mbs prices 
this effect was especially pronounced for agency backed mbs that the us federal reserve is expected to target for acquisition under qe since the initial price spike  prices for all but the target securities have receded below the price levels that existed before the announcement of qe to the extent that the scope and effectiveness of government sponsored refinancing programs increases  prepayments on our target securities could increase accordingly 
the combination of higher prices and higher refinancing activity on our target securities could decrease our net interest margin 
to the extent qe decreases the liquidity in the market of our target securities  which has yet to be the case  we might not be able to acquire the securities we target or acquire them in the quantities we desire 
the us federal reserve expects these measures to put downward pressure on long term interest rates 
in the short term  these actions have driven agency backed mbs prices to new highs  which have further compressed interest spreads  and increased the sensitivity to increases in prepayments 
while there are signs of a recovery  uncertainty continues to dominate the market  due to the continued historically low interest rate environment and the european financial crisis 
we believe the general business environment will continue to be challenging in and future periods 
our growth outlook is dependent  in part  on the strength of the financial markets  the impact of fiscal and monetary policy actions by the united states and other countries  the overall market value of us equities and liquidity in the financial system 
depending on the market development and movement  we may seek to re align our strategy and our portfolio 
we will continue to closely monitor the developments in the market and evaluate the opportunities across the spectrum in the mortgage industry and seek the highest risk adjusted returns for our capital 

table of contents executive summary during  we completed two public offerings of our class a common stock  raising an aggregate of million in capital  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses 
we deployed the capital raised from these public offerings primarily in year fixed rate agency backed mbs and private label mbs 
as of december   our mbs portfolio consisted of billion in fair value 
we believe that our mbs portfolio continued to perform well during the year ended december  the overall value of our agency backed mbs portfolio increased  primarily as a result of qe  the low interest rate environment  and the value of our private label mbs portfolio held steady  primarily from an expected improvement in credit performance in general 
as discussed above  unlike the prior quantitative easing programs  qe is more open ended which we consider a significant change 
this has affected mbs products by increasing the price of these bonds 
however  these actions by the us federal reserve have caused some concern that the effect of lower borrowing costs will increase the prepayments of the existing mbs population 
this in turn  has caused mbs with prepayment protection attributes  such as most of our mbs positions  to increase in value 
while we benefit from the increase in price  it may result in decreases in yields and net spread 
continued expectations of stabilization and improvement in the housing market  increased liquidity and available leverage have stabilized prices for our private label mbs  particularly among re remic mezzanine securities 
our re remic securities are predominantly held in the subordinate tranches 
we will continue to closely monitor the performance of these securities 
we believe we have constructed a private label mbs portfolio with attractive characteristics and will continue to monitor relative value between the various classes of mbs  including agency backed mbs  and may re allocate our portfolio at any time based on management s view of the market 
we continued to evaluate the opportunities across the mortgage industry and seek the highest risk adjusted returns for our capital  and to strengthen our position and to maximize return to our shareholders 
we evaluated and prioritized the risk adjusted return we expect to receive on every asset based upon a current cash yield perspective as well as from a total yield perspective that includes expected reflation  which is defined as an increase in value between the amortized cost basis and the par value of the security 
historically  based on market conditions  we believe our mbs assets have provided us with higher relative risk adjusted rates of return than most other portfolio opportunities we have evaluated 
consequently  we have maintained a high allocation of our assets and capital in this sector 
we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities against the returns available in each of our asset alternatives and endeavor to allocate our assets and capital with an emphasis toward what we believe will generate the highest risk adjusted return available 
this strategy may cause us to have different allocations of capital in different environments 
we believe we have constructed a private label mbs portfolio with attractive characteristics and will continue to monitor relative value between the various classes of mbs 
we also believe the strategy of maintaining our combined portfolio  agency backed mbs and private label mbs  allows us to mitigate risk exposures in a sometimes unexpected and volatile environment 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  net of million in valuation allowance 
for the year ended december   we released million of valuation allowance previously provided for certain deferred tax assets 
our evaluation of the reasonableness of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is an on going process 
the evaluation includes an assessment of both the positive and negative evidences such as historical results of operations and future projections  the size of the mbs portfolio  net yield  and comparison of management s forecasts to actual results 
for the year ended december   we determined that the positive evidences described below out weighed the negative evidences and that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our forecast of future net income  which provides support for the release of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets resulted from nols and other temporary items 
we cannot assure you  however that these deferred tax assets will in fact be realized 
see item a risk factors future decreases in the company s book value attributable to deferred tax assets may reduce the market price of our shares 
in this annual report on form k 
we have generated taxable income of million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively  demonstrating a positive and consistent earnings trend over the three year period ended december  we expect to continue to benefit from the significant increase in our mbs portfolio 
our mbs portfolio increased to billion as of december  from billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily from the deployment of the proceeds from our capital raising activities during the year ended december  as discussed above 
in addition to the capital raising activities  there were several other significant transactions that occurred in that further support the release of the valuation allowance 
the significant growth in our mbs portfolio  as discussed above  provides a level of net interest income that can absorb a higher degree of volatility and uncertainty in the market  which we expect to provide a more stable and consistent level of income 
along with the growth in our agency backed mbs  our borrowing capacity also increased with various counterparties and credit availability of the counterparties also expanded 
in addition  various market conditions are also showing signs of improvement and stabilization such as housing price appreciation 

table of contents we maintained a valuation allowance of million as of december  on our deferred tax assets attributable to ncls that are expected to expire in and with the release of the valuation allowance  our book value per share of as of december  reflects per share related to the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
as we benefit from the utilization of the deferred tax assets in future periods  the corresponding book value attributable to the deferred tax assets utilized will be reduced by the same amount and the reported gaap net income will also be reduced for the corresponding income tax effect 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  as of december   our book value per share was 
in addition to the release of million of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that was included in net income  our net income includes net interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  our other expenses increased to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the following is a summary of our net income for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands net interest income other loss income  net other expenses income before income taxes income tax benefit provision net income in addition to the financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied in the united states gaap  we calculated non gaap core operating income for the years ended december  and our core operating income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
in determining core operating income  we excluded certain costs and the following non cash expenses compensation costs associated with stock based awards  accretion of mbs purchase discounts adjusted for principal repayments in excess of proportionate invested capital  unrealized mark to market adjustments on the trading mbs and hedge instruments  other than temporary impairment charges recognized  and release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
this non gaap measurement is used by management to analyze and assess the operating results and dividends 
we believe that this non gaap measurement assists investors in understanding the impact of these non core items and non cash expenses on our performance and provides additional clarity around our forward earnings capacity and trend 
a limitation of utilizing this non gaap measure is that the gaap accounting effects of these events do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing our financial results 
therefore  we believe net income on a gaap basis and core operating income on a non gaap basis should be considered together 
the following is a reconciliation of gaap net income to non gaap core operating income for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gaap net income adjustments adjusted expenses release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets stock compensation net unrealized mark to market loss on trading mbs and hedge instruments other than temporary impairment charges adjusted interest related to purchase discount accretion non gaap core operating income adjusted expenses reflect certain professional fees  litigation expenses and recovery  and income taxes that are not considered representative of routine or core operating related activities of our company 
adjusted interest related to purchase discount accretion represents purchase discount accretion in excess of principal repayment in excess of proportional share of invested capital 

table of contents as of december   our agency backed mbs consisted of billion in face value with a cost basis of billion and was fair valued at billion 
our agency backed mbs had a weighted average coupon of and a weighted average cost of funding of at december  during the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from the sale of million in face value of our agency backed mbs  realizing million in net gains  or realized net gains of million from the acquisition price 
we have entered into eurodollar futures to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity which directly impacts our cost of borrowing and the market value of our agency backed mbs 
the eurodollar futures mature through september  and have a lifetime weighted average rate of  as compared to a lifetime weighted average market rate of as of december  the value of these five year hedge instruments is expected to fluctuate inversely relative to the agency backed mbs portfolio and decrease in value during periods of declining interest rates and or widening mortgage spreads 
conversely  during periods of increasing rates and or tightening mortgage spreads  these instruments are expected to increase in value 
the cost of these eurodollar hedges will increase over their five year term 
as of december   our private label mbs portfolio consisted of million in face value with an amortized cost basis of million and was fair valued at million 
the unamortized net discount on our private label mbs portfolio was million as of december  during the year ended december   we recognized net interest income of million  representing a annualized yield  including coupon and accretion of purchase discount based on the current accretable yield rate  from our private label mbs portfolio 
we also recognized million in other than temporary impairment charges during the year ended december  this charge does not affect non gaap core operating income or book value  but does reduce our net income and lowers the accounting basis used to record future discount accretion 
during  we received proceeds of million from the sale of million in face value of our private label mbs  realizing million in gains 
for available for sale  private label mbs securities that have been acquired at discounts to face value due in part to credit deterioration since origination  we re evaluate the undiscounted expected future cash flows and the changes in cash flows from those originally projected at the time of purchase or last revised 
for those securities in an unrealized loss position  the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted using current expected rate of return is recorded as other than temporary impairment charges through our statement of comprehensive income 
during  we recognized million and million in other than temporary impairment charges on our private label mbs portfolio and on an investment in interest only mbs  respectively 
in our private label mbs  we have continued to benefit from the increased allocation of capital to re remic mezzanine securities as well as an average purchase price basis of of face value 
continued expectations of stabilization and improvement in housing  increased liquidity and available leverage have raised prices for private label mbs  particularly among re remic mezzanine securities 
our re remic securities are predominantly held in the subordinate tranches 
we will continue to closely monitor the performance of these securities 
we believe we have constructed a private label mbs portfolio with attractive characteristics and will continue to monitor relative value between the various classes of mbs including agency backed mbs and may re allocate our portfolio at any time based on management s view of the market 
we will continue to seek to identify potential opportunities to strengthen our position and to maximize return to our shareholders

we recognized interest expense costs of million for the years ended december  and other expenses increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of an increase in legal costs related to the sec inquiry and hildene litigation 
the both cases have been resolved favorably without material financial impact

our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in during the years ended december  and  ordinary taxable income was subject to alternative minimum tax 
our effective tax rates during these periods differed from statutory rates primarily due to the expected use of federal and state net operating losses nols to offset our taxable income earned during those periods

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  and for other general business purposes 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of short term borrowings eg  repurchase agreements  principal and interest payments on mbs and proceeds from sales of mbs 
other sources of liquidity include proceeds from the offering of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities or other securities registered pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s file no 
with the sec 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective on january  pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we may issue and publicly distribute various types of securities  including class a common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants and units  or any combination of such securities  from time to time  in one or more offerings  up to an aggregate amount of million 
we filed the shelf registration statement to gain additional flexibility in accessing capital markets for  among other things  the acquisition of mbs and other assets  the repayment of outstanding indebtedness  the pursuit of growth initiatives that may include acquisitions  working capital  and for liquidity needs 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all 
pursuant to our shelf registration statement  we completed two public offerings during the year ended december  we received aggregate net proceeds of million from the offerings of  shares  including  shares for the underwriter s over allotment options  of our class a common stock  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses 
liquidity  or ready access to funds  is essential to our business 
liquidity is of particular importance to our business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our counterparties willingness to engage in transactions with us 
our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects us or third parties 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time 
if we cannot obtain funding from third parties or from our subsidiaries  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

table of contents potential future sources of liquidity for us include existing cash balances  borrowing capacity through margin accounts and repurchase agreements and cash flows from operations  future issuances of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities or other securities registered pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
funding for agency backed mbs through repurchase agreements continues to be available to us at rates we consider to be attractive from multiple counterparties  and we have observed increased availability for funding for private label mbs through repurchase agreements 
sources of funding we believe that our existing cash balances  investments in private label mbs  net investments in agency backed mbs  cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
we have obtained  and believe we will be able to continue to obtain  short term financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with our financing objectives 
we may  however  seek debt or equity financings  in public or private transactions  to provide capital for corporate purposes and or strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
our policy is to evaluate strategic business opportunities  including acquisitions and divestitures  as they arise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient funds from future operations  or raise sufficient debt or equity on acceptable terms  to take advantage of investment opportunities that become available 
should our needs ever exceed these sources of liquidity  we believe that most of our investments could be sold  in most circumstances  to provide cash 
however  we may be required to sell our assets in such instances at depressed prices 
as of december   our liabilities totaled billion 
in addition to other payables and accrued expenses  our indebtedness consisted of repurchase agreements and long term debentures 
these long term debentures accrue and require payments of interest quarterly at annual rates of three month libor plus to  mature between and and are currently redeemable by us  in whole or in part  without penalty 
as of december   we had million of total long term debt 
as of december   our debt to equity leverage ratio was to we also have short term financing facilities that are structured as repurchase agreements with various financial institutions to primarily fund our portfolio of agency backed mbs 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate under these agreements was 
our repurchase agreements include provisions contained in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the securities industry and financial markets association and may be amended and supplemented in accordance with industry standards for repurchase facilities 
our repurchase agreements include financial covenants  with which the failure to comply would constitute an event of default under the applicable repurchase agreement 
similarly  each repurchase agreement includes events of insolvency and events of default on other indebtedness 
as provided in the standard master repurchase agreement as typically amended  upon the occurrence of an event of default or termination event the applicable counterparty has the option to terminate all repurchase transactions under such counterparty s repurchase agreement and to demand immediate payment of any amount due from us to the counterparty 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral ie  a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
margin calls on repurchase agreements collateralized by our mbs investments primarily result from events such as declines in the value of the underlying mortgage collateral caused by factors such as rising interest rates or prepayments 
to date  we have not had any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should we encounter increases in interest rates or prepayments  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result in a material adverse change in our liquidity position 
in the event that market conditions are such that we are unable to obtain financing for our investments in mbs in amounts and at interest rates consistent with our financing objectives  to the extent deemed appropriate  we may use cash to finance our investments or we may liquidate such investments 
accordingly  depending on market conditions  we may incur significant losses on any such sales of mbs

off balance sheet arrangements and other commitments from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that include indemnification obligations of varying scope and terms 
in addition  in the past  we have entered into indemnification agreements with certain of our current and former directors and officers under which we are generally required to indemnify them against liability incurred by them in connection with any action or proceeding to which they are or may be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities 
our charter and the virginia stock corporation act also generally require us to indemnify our directors and officers against any liability incurred by them in connection with any action or proceeding to which they are or may be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities  subject to certain exceptions 
in the future we may be the subject of indemnification assertions under our charter  virginia law or these indemnification agreements by our current or former directors and officers who are or may become party to any action or proceeding 

table of contents we maintain directors and officers insurance policies that may limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid with respect to such obligations 
however  it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification obligations due to the varying terms of such obligations  the limited history of prior indemnification claims  the unique facts and circumstances involved in connection with each particular contractual arrangement and each potential future claim for indemnification and the contingency of any potential liabilities upon the occurrence of events that are not reasonably determinable 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses and the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant
