overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance analog power ics  mixed signal and digital ics 
these products address a wide range of end markets including cellular handsets  enterprise and portable computing  enterprise and home networking  wide area and metropolitan area networks and industrial equipment 
the company also manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services for customers who produce electronic systems for communications  consumer and military applications 
to enhance the readers understanding of the company performance  the following chronological overview of the company results for the years through have been provided 
for the year ended december   revenues increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to greater overall demand from customers in all of the company geographies and end markets  which resulted from improved macro economic conditions  an expanded sales force  solid operational execution and increased shipments of new products 
gross margin for increased to  from for this increase was primarily due to improved factory utilization and  to a lesser extent  a reduced sales mix of lower margin products shipped to the wireless handset market as compared to operating margin for was which represents the highest level in a decade 
net income increased over in to million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in the diluted earnings per share of was an all time annual record for micrel and surpassed its previous record of  which was achieved in when total revenues were higher than revenues in the increase in diluted earnings per share was due in part to a decrease in the number of diluted shares in  as compared to  as a result of the company s share repurchase program 
during cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased more than to million as compared to  and the company generated million in cash flows from operations 
in addition  in the company repurchased million of its common stock  and paid million in dividends to shareholders 
for the year ended december   revenues decreased to from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower customer demand across most of the company s geographies and end markets  which resulted from global macro economic conditions 
gross margin for decreased to from for this decrease was primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin consumer oriented products and lower factory utilization 
operating margin for was which decreased from the record level of in net income was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  an increase of million from million in the company generated million in cash flows from operations in in addition  in the company repurchased million of its common stock  and paid million in dividends to shareholders 
for the year ended december   revenues decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the continued global downturn which impacted europe to a greater degree resulting in less demand of the company products  partially offset by an increase of revenues from asia due to added revenues from the acquisition of phaselink since the second quarter of the book to bill ratio was approximately one for the full year of gross margin for decreased to from for the decrease was primarily due to lower factory utilization and increased inventory reserve charges 
operating margin for decreased to from for principally due to lower sales and increased spending in research and development 
net income was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in during  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million from million primarily due to repurchases of the company common stock totaling million and million paid in dividends to shareholders 
additionally  during  the company paid a total of million net of cash acquired for the acquisition of phaselink 

table of contents the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for  and  the company standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets that it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures and the successful development and customer acceptance of new products 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion and in part i item a 
risk factors of this report 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  including global economic conditions  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 
revision of prior period financial statements during the fourth quarter of  the company management identified several income tax provision and income tax balance sheet classification errors that impacted the company previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended december      and prior 
the company assessed the materiality of these errors on prior periods financial statements in accordance with asc sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 materiality  and concluded that the errors were not material to any prior annual or interim periods but would be material to the fourth quarter and year ended december  if the entire correction of such errors was recorded in in accordance with asc sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  the financial statements of prior periods presented herein in this report on form k have been revised 
the revision had no impact on the company total cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities for all the prior periods affected 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and the unaudited supplemental quarterly financial information for the impact of the revisions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  share based accounting and income taxes to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables 
the company generates revenue by selling products to oems  sell through distributors and sell in distributors 
sell in distributors may buy and stock the company s products for resale or may act as the company s sales representative in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents the company allows certain sell through distributors located in north america and europe  and in certain countries in asia  to have price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
as these price concessions have historically been significant  and price concessions are difficult to reliably estimate  the company defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these sell through distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
although revenue and related cost of sales are not recognized  the company records an accounts receivable and relieves inventory at the time of initial product shipment 
as standard terms are fob shipping point  payment terms are enforced from shipment date and legal title and risk of inventory loss passes to the sell through distributor upon shipment 
in addition  where revenue is deferred upon shipment and recognized on a sell through basis  the company may offer price adjustments to its sell through distributors to allow the distributor to price the company s products competitively for specific resale opportunities 
the company estimates and records an allowance for distributor price adjustments for which the specific resale transaction has been completed  but the price adjustment claim has not yet been received by the company 
sales to oem customers and sell in distributors are recognized based upon the shipment terms of the sale transaction when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company does not grant return rights  price protection or pricing adjustments to oem customers 
the company offers limited contractual stock rotation rights to sell in distributors 
in addition  the company is not contractually obligated to offer  but may infrequently grant  price adjustments or price protection to certain sell in distributors on an exception basis 
at the time of shipment to oems and sell in distributors  an allowance for returns is established based upon historical return rates  and an allowance for price adjustments is established based on an estimate of price adjustments to be granted 
actual future returns and price adjustments could be different than the allowance established 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once an inventory write down provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
share based compensation 
share based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense in the statement of operations 
to determine fair value  the company uses the black scholes valuation model which requires input factors such as expected term  stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
in addition  the company estimates expected forfeiture rates of stock grants and share based compensation expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest 
determining the input factors  such as expected term  expected volatility and estimated forfeiture rates  requires significant judgment based on subjective future expectations 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  and state research and development credit carryforwards 
the company must regularly assess the likelihood that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to ultimately realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   due to california tax law changes in which require mandatory single sales factor apportionment in california for most multi state taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january   it became more likely than not that all of the company california deferred tax assets would not be recognized 
as such  a valuation allowance was recorded on the california deferred tax assets as of december  the company believed that future taxable income levels would be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of the remaining deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that future realization of these tax benefits is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance would be established  which would increase the company tax provision in the period of such determination 
the company uses a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations total other income  net income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest provision for income taxes net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to micrel  incorporated shareholders net revenues 
net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in standard product revenues  which represented of net revenues  decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for these decreases were primarily due to lower customer demand across the company s end markets and geographies which resulted primarily from continued global macroeconomic conditions partially offset by revenues from the acquisition of phaselink 
other products revenues  which consist of custom and foundry product revenues  increased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher demand in custom products 
net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in standard product revenues  which represented of net revenues  decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for these decreases were due to lower customer demand across the company s geographies and end markets  which resulted primarily from global macroeconomic conditions 
other products revenues  which consist of custom and foundry product revenues  increased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was due primarily to an increase in foundry services 
customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
historically  the company s revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders for products to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter 
within the semiconductor industry  orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter are called turns fill orders 
when the turns fill level exceeds approximately of quarterly revenues  it can be very difficult to predict near term revenues and income 
the resulting lack of visibility into demand also makes it difficult to match product build with future demand as the company lead times to build its products may be substantially longer than order lead times 
as noted in item a risk factors and above in the overview section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  a trend has developed over the last several years whereby customers in the semiconductor supply chain have worked to minimize the amount of inventory of semiconductors they hold 
as a consequence  customers are generally providing less order backlog to the company and other semiconductor suppliers  and relying on short lead times to buffer their build schedules 
shorter lead times reduce visibility into end demand and increase the reliance on turns fill orders 
the reluctance of customers to provide order backlog together with short lead times and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy  make it difficult to precisely predict future levels of sales and profitability 

table of contents international sales represented  and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to customers in asia represented of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  and of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has resulted in increased pricing pressure for the company and other semiconductor manufacturers 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
this can make it more difficult for us based companies to differentiate themselves in any manner other than by lowering prices 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region has led  and may continue to lead  to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 
gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing capacity utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for this decrease was primarily due to lower factory utilization and increased inventory reserve charges 
for the year ended december   the company gross margin decreased to from for this decrease was primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin consumer oriented products and lower factory utilization 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues represented for the year ended december  compared to for on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase was primarily due to increased mask expenses for research and development activities  consulting services  added headcount from the acquisition of phaselink and an impairment of million for purchased technology which was replaced by more advanced technologies 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee compensation costs 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue its investment in research and development activities in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented for the year ended december  as compared to for on an absolute dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase primarily resulted from increased spending on product marketing activities  added headcount expenses from the acquisition of phaselink and related amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets  increased share based compensation expense and a payment for a legal settlement  which were partially offset by decreased profit sharing accruals and a reduction of selling expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million from million for this decrease was primarily due to decreased staffing levels  decreased sales commissions and decreased bonus compensation accruals 
share based compensation 
share based compensation costs for stock option grants are based on the fair value calculated from a stock option pricing model on the date of grant 
the company results of operations for the years ended december   and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of share based compensation awards 
during  the company recorded million in pre tax share based compensation expense  of which million is included in cost of revenues  million is included in research and development expense and million is included in sales  general and administrative expense 
during  the company recorded million in pre tax share based compensation expense  of which million is included in cost of revenues  million is included in research and development expense and million is included in sales  general and administrative expense

table of contents provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million  or of income before taxes  as compared to million  or of income before taxes for and million or of income before taxes for the increase in was primarily due to a valuation allowance of million established against deferred tax assets due to california tax law changes in which require mandatory single sales factor apportionment in california for most multi state taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january  the provision for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effects of non deductible share based compensation expense  state income taxes  federal and state research and development credits  the establishment of a california valuation allowance  and federal qualified production activity deductions 
the tax provision for the year ended december  excluded the benefit from the federal research and development credit which expired on december  on january   a tax law was enacted to retroactively reinstate the federal research and development tax credit 
the company will recognize the benefit for in the first quarter of although it had been retroactively reinstated for  the benefits could not be recorded for as the tax law was enacted not until january  the tax rate in will reflect two years of the benefit from the federal research and development tax credit
