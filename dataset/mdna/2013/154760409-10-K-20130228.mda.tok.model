our former subsidiary central pacific homeloans  inc was merged into the bank in february supervision and regulation set forth below is a description of the material elements of the laws and regulations and other regulatory matters applicable to us and our bank 
the following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion 
regulators  congress  state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules  laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors 
the nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on our business cannot be predicted and  in some cases  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory agencies central pacific financial corp 
is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
as a bank holding company  central pacific financial corp 
is regulated under the bhc act and is subject to inspection  examination and supervision by the frb 
it is also subject to hawaii s code of financial institutions and is subject to inspection  examination and supervision by the dfi 
the company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  as administered by the sec 
our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the trading symbol cpf  and we are subject to the rules of the nyse for companies listed there 
central pacific bank  as a hawaii chartered bank  is subject to primary supervision  periodic examination and regulation by the dfi and fdic 
central pacific financial corp  as a bank holding company  is also subject to certain regulations promulgated by the frb 
in its periodic examinations  each of these regulatory bodies assesses our financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity and other aspects of our operations 
these bodies also determine whether our management is violating or has violated any law or regulation 
the dfi and frb  and separately the fdic as insurer of the bank s deposits  have various remedies available to them 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital or establish specific minimum capital ratios  to restrict the bank s growth  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  to institute a receivership  and ultimately to terminate the bank s deposit insurance  which for a hawaii chartered bank would result in a revocation of its charter 
regulatory matters as previously reported  in may  the regulatory consent order the consent order that the bank entered into with the fdic and the dfi on december  was lifted 
in place of the consent order  the board of directors of the bank entered into a memorandum of understanding the bank mou with the fdic and dfi effective may  since this time  we have worked closely with both the fdic and dfi to satisfactorily resolve all outstanding issues contained in the bank mou  including but not limited to  maintaining an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  improving our asset quality  reducing our classified assets  and ensuring that our capital levels exceeded the levels required by the bank mou 
on october   the bank mou was lifted 
on july   we entered into the written agreement with the frbsf and dfi 
the written agreement provided that unless we receive the consent of the frbsf and dfi  we cannot i pay dividends  ii receive dividends or payments representing a reduction in capital from the bank  iii directly or through our non bank subsidiaries make any payments on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities  iv directly or through any non bank subsidiaries incur  increase or guarantee any debt  or v purchase or redeem any shares of our stock 
on february   the written agreement was terminated 
accordingly  we are no longer subject to any of its requirements 
on october   the bank entered into a separate memorandum of understanding the compliance mou with the fdic to improve the bank s compliance management system cms 
under the compliance mou  we are required to  among other things  i improve the board of directors oversight of the bank s cms  ii ensure the establishment and implementation of the bank s cms is commensurate with the complexity of the bank s operations  iii perform a full review of all compliance policy and procedures  then revise and adopt policy and procedures to ensure compliance with all consumer protection regulations  iv enhance the bank s training program relating to consumer protection and fair lending regulations  v develop and implement an effective internal monitoring program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  vi strengthen the compliance audit function to ensure that the compliance audits are appropriately and comprehensively scoped  vii develop and implement internal controls for the bank s third party payment processing activity  viii strengthen the board of directors and senior management s oversight of third party relationships and ix enhance the bank s overdraft payment program the bank believes it has already taken substantial steps to comply with the compliance mou 
in addition to the steps taken to comply with the compliance mou  the bank received an outstanding rating in a recently completed community reinvestment performance evaluation that measures how financial institutions support their communities in the areas of lending  investment and service 
we cannot provide any assurance on whether or when the company and the bank will be in full compliance with the compliance mou or whether or when the compliance mou will be terminated 
even if terminated  we may still be subject to other agreements with regulators that restrict our activities and may also continue to impose capital ratios or other requirements on our business 
the requirements and restrictions of the compliance mou are judicially enforceable and the company or the bank failure to comply with such requirements and restrictions may subject the company and the bank to additional regulatory restrictions including the imposition of additional regulatory requirements or orders  limitations on our activities  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  and further directives which affect our business  including  in the most severe circumstances  termination of the bank s deposit insurance or appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank 
bank holding company activities under the bhc act  the company  as a bank holding company  is subject to the federal reserve regulation and its authority to  among other things require periodic reports and such additional information as the federal reserve may require in its discretion  require the maintenance of certain levels of capital  restrict the ability of bank holding companies to service debt or to receive dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks  require prior approval for senior executive officer and director changes under certain circumstances  require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources as necessary to support each subsidiary bank 
a bank holding company failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the federal reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of federal reserve regulations or both under current law  and will be a statutory violation under the dodd frank act  as described below  terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries  affiliates or investments if the federal reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary  regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt  including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem our securities in certain situations  and approve acquisitions and mergers with banks and consider certain competitive  management  financial  financial stability and other factors in granting these approvals 
similar california and other state banking agency approvals may also be required 
our ability to acquire direct or indirect ownership of other companies and to engage directly or indirectly in certain activities is subject to limitation and regulation by the frb and dfi 
because we are a holding company  our rights and the rights of our creditors and security holders to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary creditors  except to the extent we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary 
in addition  there are various statutory and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the bank can finance or otherwise transfer funds to us or to our non bank subsidiaries  including certain investment funds to which the bank serves as an investment adviser  whether in the form of loans or other extensions of credit  including a purchase of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase  securities investments  the borrowing or lending of securities to the extent that the transaction causes the bank or a subsidiary to have credit exposure to the affiliate  or certain other specified types of transactions  as discussed in further detail below 
furthermore  loans and other extensions of credit by the bank to us or any of our non bank subsidiaries are required to be secured by specified amounts of collateral and are required to be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
affiliate transactions transactions between our subsidiary bank  on the one hand  and cpf and its other subsidiaries  on the other hand  are regulated by the frb 
these regulations limit the types and amounts of transactions including loans due and extensions of credit from our subsidiary bank that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm s length basis 
these regulations generally do not apply to transactions between a us bank subsidiary and its subsidiaries 
in general  these regulations require that any extensions of credit must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited  as to any one of cpf or its non bank subsidiaries  to of our subsidiary bank s capital stock and surplus  and  as to the holding company and all such non bank subsidiaries in the aggregate  to of our subsidiary bank s capital stock and surplus 
these restrictions  other than the of capital limit on covered transactions with any one affiliate  are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries 
the dodd frank act significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization 
for example  effective july  the dodd frank act required that the of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to financial subsidiaries 
it also required that  effective july  derivative transactions under which a bank or a subsidiary has credit exposure to an affiliate be treated as covered transactions  with the term credit exposure to be defined by the frb under its existing rulemaking authority 
in addition  our ability to make loans to our directors and officers is limited to applicable regulation 
source of strength doctrine frb policy historically has required bank holding companies to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries 
the dodd frank act codifies this policy as a statutory requirement 
such support may be required by the frb at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it 
any capital loan by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks 
the bhc act provides that in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 
capital requirements the federal banking agencies adopted guidelines governing risk based capital and allowable leverage capital levels for bank holding companies and banks that are expected to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  such as loans  and those recorded as off balance sheet items  such as commitments  letters of credit and recourse arrangements 
under current capital guidelines  banking organizations are required to maintain certain minimum risk based capital ratios  which are calculated by dividing a banking organization qualifying capital by its risk weighted assets including both on and off balance sheet assets 
risk weighted assets are calculated by assigning assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
qualifying capital is classified depending on the type of capital 
for the company tier capital consists of common equity  retained earnings  qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued prior to may  and noncontrolling interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries including trust preferred securities  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
qualifying tier capital may consist of trust preferred securities issued prior to may   subject to certain criteria and quantitative limits for inclusion of restricted core capital elements in tier capital 
tier capital includes  among other things  hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt  mandatory convertible debt securities  qualifying term subordinated debt  preferred stock that does not qualify as tier capital  and a limited amount of allowance for loan and lease losses 
as a bank holding company  the company is subject to three capital ratios a total risk based capital ratio  a tier risk based capital ratio and a tier leverage ratio 
to be classified as adequately capitalized  the minimum required ratios for bank holding companies and banks are eight percent  four percent and four percent  respectively 
to be well capitalized  the company must at all times have a total risk based capital  tier risk based capital and tier leverage ratio of at least ten percent  six percent and five percent  respectively 
as of december   both the company and the bank were considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
the federal banking agencies may change existing capital guidelines or adopt new capital guidelines in the future pursuant to the dodd frank act  the implementation of basel iii described below or other regulatory or supervisory changes 
for instance  the dodd frank act further requires the federal banking agencies to adopt capital requirements which address the risks that the activities of an institution poses to the institution and the public and private stakeholders  including risks arising from certain enumerated activities 
notwithstanding these capital ratio requirements  pursuant to federal regulatory guidance  banking organizations are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum or well capitalized ratios  with the amount of capital held commensurate with its risk exposure 
the capital ratios for the company and the bank as of december  are provided in our financial statements 
see note parent company and regulatory restrictions 
prompt corrective action and other general enforcement authority state and federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action against an insured bank and its holding company 
federal laws require each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks 
each federal banking agency issued regulations defining five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed  based on the level of its capital ratios well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to more restrictions  including restrictions on the bank activities  operational practices or the ability to pay dividends 
based upon its capital levels  a bank that is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition  or an unsafe or unsound practice  warrants such treatment 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  bank holding companies and insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business  or for violation of any law  rule  regulation  condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency 
in more serious cases  enforcement actions may include the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank  the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of the bank deposit insurance  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers  directors  and other institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
the fdic may terminate a depository institution deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that may prejudice the interest of the bank depositors 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank charter by the dfi 
basel  basel ii and basel iii accords the current risk based capital guidelines that apply to the company and the bank are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors  as implemented by the federal reserve 
in  the federal reserve began to phase in capital standards based on a second capital accord  referred to as basel ii  for large or core international banks total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more 
basel ii emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  as well as supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements 
on september   the group of governors and heads of supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  announced agreement on the calibration and phase in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements  known as the basel capital adequacy accords or basel iii 
basel iii increases the minimum tier common equity ratio to  net of regulatory deductions  and introduces a capital conservation buffer of an additional of common equity to risk weighted assets  raising the target minimum common equity ratio to 
basel iii increases a the minimum tier capital ratio to inclusive of the capital conservation buffer  b increases the minimum total capital ratio to inclusive of the capital buffer and c introduces a countercyclical capital buffer of up to of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital for periods of excess credit growth 
basel iii also introduces a non risk adjusted tier leverage ratio of  based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets  and new liquidity standards 
the basel iii capital and liquidity standards are expected to be phased in over a multi year period 
the final package of basel iii reforms was published at the end of  and is subject to individual adoption by member nations  including the united states 
in june  the frb issued proposed rules intended to help ensure banks maintain strong capital positions  enabling them to continue lending to creditworthy households and businesses even after unforeseen losses and during severe economic downturns 
taken together  the proposals would implement in the united states the basel iii regulatory capital reforms from the basel committee on banking supervision and changes required by the dodd frank act 
in particular  the notice of proposed rulemaking npr entitled regulatory capital rules regulatory capital  implementation of basel iii  minimum regulatory capital ratios  capital adequacy  and transition provisions  would apply to all depository institutions  bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of million or more  and savings and loan holding companies 
consistent with the international basel framework  this npr would increase the quantity and quality of capital required by proposing a new minimum common equity tier ratio of percent of risk weighted assets and a common equity tier capital conservation buffer of percent of risk weighted assets  and raise the minimum tier capital ratio from percent to percent of risk weighted assets  revise the definition of capital to improve the ability of regulatory capital instruments to absorb losses  including the gradual phase out of trust preferred securities as a component of tier capital  establish limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if additional specified amounts  or buffers  of common equity tier capital are not met  and introduce a supplementary leverage ratio for internationally active banking organizations 
the basel iii proposal would also revise the board prompt corrective action framework by incorporating the new regulatory capital minimums and updating the definition of tangible common equity 
prompt corrective action is an enforcement framework used by supervisors to constrain the activities of banking organizations based on the level of regulatory capital 
additionally  the npr entitled regulatory capital rules standardized approach for risk weighted assets  market discipline and disclosure requirements  also would apply to all banking organizations 
this npr would revise and harmonize the board rules for calculating risk weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses that have been identified over the past several years 
to promote short term resilience of a bank liquidity risk profile  the basel committee developed the liquidity coverage ratio lcr 
this standard aims to ensure that a bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered high quality liquid assets consisting of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets to meet its liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario 
the lcr is the ratio of the stock of high quality liquid assets to total net cash outflows over the next calendar days 
in january  amendments were adopted to the liquidity coverage ratio to begin as planned on january   but to impose a minimum lcr requirement at  rising in equal annual steps of percentage points to reach on january  we believe the federal reserve is likely to implement changes to the capital adequacy and liquidity standards applicable to the company and the bank in light of basel iii  the dodd frank act and the overall regulatory environment which would increase the capital requirements of financial institutions generally  including the company and the bank 
insolvency of an insured depository institution if the fdic were appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution such as central pacific bank  upon its insolvency or in certain other events  the fdic has the power i to transfer any of the depository institution s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution s creditors  ii to enforce the terms of the depository institution s contracts pursuant to their terms  or iii to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party  the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution 
in addition  under federal law  the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution  including claims of debt holders of the institution  in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver 
as a result  whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of central pacific bank  the debt holders would be treated differently from  and could receive  if anything  substantially less than  the depositors of the depository institution 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the events of the past several years led to numerous new laws and regulatory pronouncements in the united states and internationally for financial institutions 
the dodd frank act  enacted in  is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the united states 
the dodd frank act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities  requiring ongoing stress testing of capital  mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements  increasing regulation of executive and incentive based compensation and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector depending  in part  on the size of the financial institution 
among other things  the dodd frank act provides for capital standards applicable to bank holding companies may be no less stringent than those applied to insured depository institutions  annual stress tests and early remediation or so called living wills are required for larger banks with more than billon assets as well risk committees of its board of directors that include a risk expert and such requirements may have the effect of establishing new best practices standards for smaller banks  the assessment base for federal deposit insurance was changed to consolidated assets less tangible capital instead of the amount of insured deposits  which generally increased the insurance fees of larger banks  but had relatively less impact on smaller banks  repeal of the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits  including business checking accounts  and made permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance  the establishment of the consumer finance protection bureau the cfpb with responsibility for promulgating and enforcing regulations designed to protect consumers financial interests and prohibit unfair  deceptive and abusive acts and practices by financial institutions  the cfpb to directly examine those financial institutions with billion or more in assets for compliance with the regulations promulgated by the cfpb  limits  or places significant burdens and compliance and other costs  on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations  such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets  arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions  proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds  and the establishment of new compensation restrictions and standards regarding the time  manner and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation  including documentation and governance  proxy access by stockholders  deferral and claw back requirements 
as required by the dodd frank act  federal regulators published for comment proposed regulations to i increase capital requirements on banks and bank holding companies  and ii implement the so called volcker rule of the dodd frank act  which would significantly restrict certain activities by covered bank holding companies  including restrictions on proprietary trading and private equity investing 
final rules are expected in yet  many of the regulations to implement the dodd frank act have not yet been published for comment or adopted in final form and or will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company and the bank  our customers or the financial industry more generally 
individually and collectively  proposed regulations resulting from the dodd frank act may materially and adversely affect both the company s and bank s businesses  financial conditions and results of operations 
provisions in the legislation requiring revisions to the capital requirements of the company and the bank could require the company and the bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future 
many aspects of dodd frank are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us and the financial services industry more generally 
nonetheless  we anticipate increased costs associated with these new regulations 
deposit insurance we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the fdic otherwise determines  our premiums could increase  which may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of  or market for  our common stock 
all fdic insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the deposit insurance fund 
these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in the fdic may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that may prejudice the interest of the bank s depositors 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank s charter by the dfi 
depositor preference the fdia provides that  in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution  the claims of depositors of the institution  including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors  and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver  will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution 
if an insured depository institution fails  insured and uninsured depositors  along with the fdic  will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured  non deposit creditors  including the parent bank holding company  with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 
operations and consumer compliance laws the bank must comply with numerous federal anti money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations  including the usa patriot act of  the bank secrecy act  the foreign account tax compliance act effective  the cra  the fair credit reporting act  as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act  the equal credit opportunity act  the community reinvestment act  the truth in lending act  the fair housing act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the national flood insurance act and various federal and state privacy protection laws 
the bank and the company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices  untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition 
these laws and regulations also mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans  and providing other services 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the bank to lawsuits and penalties  including but not limited to enforcement actions  injunctions  fines or criminal penalties  punitive damages to consumers  and the loss of certain contractual rights 
the dodd frank act provided for the creation of the bureau as an independent entity within the federal reserve 
the bureau is a new regulatory agency for united states banks 
the bureau has broad rulemaking  supervisory  and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services  including deposit products  residential mortgages  home equity loans and credit cards 
the bureau s functions include investigating consumer complaints  conducting market research  rulemaking  supervising and examining banks consumer transactions  and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  banks such as our bank with less than billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws and the regulations of the bureau by their primary federal banking agency 
the bureau has adopted revisions to regulation z  which implements the truth in lending act tila  pursuant to dodd frank 
the revisions take effect on january  and will apply to all consumer mortgages except home equity lines of credit  timeshare plans  reverse mortgages  or temporary loans 
the revisions mandate specific underwriting criteria for home loans in order for creditors to make a reasonable  good faith determination of a consumer ability to repay and establish certain protections from liability under this requirement for qualified mortgages meeting certain standards 
in particular  when the revisions take effect  it will prevent banks from making no doc and low doc home loans  as the rules require that banks determine a consumer ability to pay based in part on verified and documented information 
because we do not originate no doc or low doc loans  we do not believe this regulation will have a significant impact on our operations 
legislative initiatives from time to time  various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in congress and state legislatures  as well as by regulatory agencies 
such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system 
such legislation could change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions and other financial institutions 
we cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on our financial condition or results of operations 
a change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us or any of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business 
employees at december   we employed persons  on a full time basis and on a part time basis 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement 
protection of net operating losses we have generated considerable tax benefits  including net operating loss carry forwards and federal and state tax credits 
our use of the tax benefits in the future would be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change for us federal income tax purposes 
in general  an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in the company s ownership by percent shareholders as defined under us income tax laws that exceeds percentage points over a rolling three year period 
on november   our board declared a dividend of preferred share purchase rights rights in respect of our common stock which were issued pursuant to a tax benefits preservation plan  dated as of november  the tax benefits preservation plan  between the company and wells fargo bank  national association  as rights agent 
each right represents the right to purchase  upon the terms and subject to the conditions in the plan   th of a share of our junior participating preferred stock  series c  no par value  for  subject to adjustment 
the tax benefits preservation plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that the company will experience an ownership change by discouraging any person from becoming a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock a threshold holder 
there is no guarantee  however  that the tax benefits preservation plan will prevent the company from experiencing an ownership change 
adoption of the tax benefits preservation plan was required by our agreements with the carlyle group carlyle and anchorage capital group  llc anchorage 
to further protect our tax benefits  on january   our board approved a proposed amendment to our restated articles of incorporation to restrict transfers of our stock if the effect of an attempted transfer would cause the transferee to become a threshold holder or to cause the beneficial ownership of a threshold holder to increase the protective charter amendment 
at our annual meeting of shareholders on april   we proposed the amendment which shareholders voted on and approved 
the protective charter amendment also does not guarantee that we will not experience an ownership change

item a 
risk factors our business faces significant risks  including credit  market liquidity  operational  legal regulatory and strategic reputation risks 
the factors described below may not be the only risks we face and are not intended to serve as a comprehensive listing or be applicable only to the category of risk under which they are disclosed 
the risks described below are generally applicable to more than one of the following categories of risks 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following factors actually occurs  our business  financial condition and or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risk factors related to our business despite signs of stabilization  uncertainty about the global and us economies could have an adverse effect on us 
although general economic trends and market conditions continue to show signs of stabilization  concerns about the global and us economies still remain  including concerns over the european sovereign debt crisis 
growing us government indebtedness  a large budget deficit  and concerns over the federal debt ceiling continue to add to the uncertainty surrounding a sustained economic recovery 
downgrades in debt instruments could raise borrowing costs and adversely impact the mortgage and housing markets  any of which could have one or more of the following adverse impacts on us i loan delinquencies may increase  ii problem assets and foreclosures may increase leading to higher loan charge offs  iii demand for our products and services may decline  iv low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease  and v collateral for loans made by us  especially involving real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans 
difficult economic and market conditions have adversely affected our industry and renewed economic slowdown in hawaii or a worsening of current market conditions in general would result in additional adverse effects on us 
the us economy entered into one of the longest economic recessions to have occurred since the great depression of the s in december although general economic trends and market conditions have since stabilized to some degree  a renewed economic slowdown in hawaii or a worsening of current market conditions in general would likely result in additional adverse effects on us  including i loan delinquencies may increase  ii problem assets and foreclosures may increase leading to more loan charge offs  iii demand for our products and services may decline  iv low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease  and v collateral for loans made by us  especially involving real estate  may continue to decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans 
furthermore  unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  our business and operations are closely tied to the hawaii market 
the hawaii economy relies on tourism  real estate  government and other service based industries 
declines in tourism  increases in energy costs  the availability of affordable air transportation  adverse weather and natural disasters and local budget issues impact consumer and corporate spending 
as a result  such events may contribute to the deterioration in hawaii s general economic condition  which could adversely impact us and our borrowers 
the high concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans in our portfolio  combined with the deterioration in these sectors caused by the economic downturn  had and may continue to have a significantly more adverse impact on our operating results than many other banks across the nation 
although we have taken a number of steps to reduce our credit risk exposure over the past several quarters  we still had million in nonperforming assets at december  if our borrowers continue to experience financial difficulty  or if property values securing our real estate loans decline further  we will continue to incur elevated credit costs due to the composition of our loan portfolio even if market conditions stabilize or improve 
our hawaii and  to a lesser extent  california commercial real estate and construction loan operations have a considerable effect on our results of operations 
the performance of our hawaii and california commercial real estate and construction loans depends on a number of factors  including the continued stabilization and eventual improvement of the real estate markets in which we operate 
as we have seen in the hawaii and california construction and commercial real estate markets since the latter part of  the strength of the real estate market and the results of our operations could continue to be negatively affected by the economic downturn 
declines in the market for commercial property from through have caused some of our commercial borrowers to suffer losses on their projects 
defaults of these loans or further deterioration in the credit worthiness of any of these borrowers would further negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
declines in housing prices and the supply of existing houses for sale could cause residential developers who are our borrowers to suffer losses on their projects and encounter difficulty in repaying their loans 
although during the years ended december  and  we saw improvement in our credit risk profile and significant reductions in our nonperforming assets  which resulted in a credit to our provision for loan and lease losses of million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  our provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   our percentage of nonperforming assets to total loans and leases  loans held for sale and other real estate was  compared to as of december  and as of december  we cannot assure you that we will have an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses to cover future losses 
if we suffer greater losses than we are projecting  our recovery plan and the ability to improve our position will be materially adversely affected 
our net income has been favorably impacted by credits to our provision for loan and lease losses  which may not continue 
over the last eight quarters  we have recorded a credit to the provision for loan and lease losses which has favorably impacted our net income 
although other factors of our overall risk profile have improved in recent quarters and general economic trends and market conditions have shown signs of stabilization to some degree  concerns over the global and us economies still remain 
accordingly  it is possible that the hawaii or california real estate markets could deteriorate as it did from the latter part of through if this occurs  it may result in an increase in loan delinquencies  loan charge offs  and our allowance for loan and lease losses 
even if economic conditions improve or stay the same  it is possible that we may experience material credit losses and in turn  increases to our allowance for loan and lease losses  due to the elevated risk still inherent in our existing loan portfolio resulting from our high concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans 
if that were to occur  we may no longer record a credit to the provision for loan and lease losses which would have an adverse impact on our net income 
a large percentage of our loans are collateralized by real estate and continued deterioration in the real estate market may result in additional losses and adversely affect our financial results 
our results of operations have been  and in future periods  will continue to be significantly impacted by the economy in hawaii  and to a lesser extent  other markets we are exposed to including california 
approximately of our loan portfolio as of december  was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate  with the significant majority of these loans concentrated in hawaii 
deterioration of the economic environment in hawaii  california or other markets we are exposed to  including a continued decline or worsening declines in the real estate market and single family home resales or a material external shock  may significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
in the event of a default with respect to any of these loans  amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest on the loan 
as we have seen in the past  material declines in the value of the real estate assets securing many of our commercial real estate loans may lead to significant credit losses in this portfolio 
as a result of our particularly high concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans  the risk within our portfolio is higher than many financial institutions and  as a result  our portfolio had been and remains particularly susceptible to significant credit losses during economic downturns and adverse changes in the real estate market 
our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
additional loan losses may occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have experienced to date 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that our loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral or guarantees securing these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment 
although during the years ended december  and  we recorded a credit to our provision for loan and lease losses amounting to million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and  our provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
our current allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses 
we may experience significant loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  which are regularly reevaluated and are based in part on current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential loan losses and the present level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  results of examinations of our loan portfolios by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the size of the allowance for loan and lease losses  we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio  our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions  as well as the requirements of any supervisory action taken by the bank s regulators and other regulatory input 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our current allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover the losses 
because of the uncertainty in the economy  volatility in the credit and real estate markets  including specifically  the deterioration in the hawaii and california real estate markets and our high concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans  we made significant adjustments to our allowance for loan and lease losses over the past several years and may need to make additional adjustments in the future 
in addition  third parties  including our federal and state regulators  periodically evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses and may communicate with us concerning the methodology or judgments that we have raised in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses 
as a result of this input  we may be required to assign different grades to specific credits  increase our provision for loan and lease losses  and or recognize further loan charge offs 
our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited or restricted 
we have generated significant net operating losses nols as a result of our recent losses 
we generally are able to carry nols forward to reduce taxable income in future years 
however  our ability to utilize the nols is subject to the rules of section of the internal revenue code 
section generally restricts the use of nols after an ownership change 
an ownership change occurs if  among other things  the shareholders or specified groups of shareholders who own or have owned  directly or indirectly  or more of a corporation s common stock or are otherwise treated as shareholders under section and treasury regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation s stock by more than percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these shareholders over a three year rolling period 
in the event of an ownership change  section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with nol carry forwards 
this annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of the corporation s stock on the date of the ownership change  multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate published monthly by the internal revenue service 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective nol carry forwards 
in order to reduce the likelihood that transactions in our common stock will result in an ownership change  on november   we adopted a tax benefits preservation plan  which provides an economic disincentive for any person or group to become an owner  for relevant tax purposes  of or more of our common stock 
to further protect our nol carryforwards  on may   we filed the protective charter amendment to restrict transfers of our common stock if the effect of the transfer would be to cause the transferee to become an owner  for relevant tax purposes  of or more of our common stock a threshold holder or cause the beneficial ownership of our common stock by any threshold holder to increase 
however  we cannot ensure that our ability to use our nols to offset income will not become limited in the future 
as a result  we could pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if our nols were available to reduce our federal income taxes without restriction 
the protective charter amendment expires on the earliest of i may   ii such time as the board of directors determines the protective charter amendment is no longer necessary for the preservation of our tax benefits and iii the date the board of directors determines that the protective charter amendment is no longer in our and our shareholders best interest 
our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity and required capital levels may be negatively impacted by uncertainty in the economic environment which may  among other things  impact our ability to satisfy our obligations 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of investments or loans  and other sources would have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include concerns regarding the continued deterioration in our financial condition  increased regulatory actions against us and a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans or deposits are concentrated 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the credit markets 
the management of liquidity risk is critical to the management of our business and our ability to service our customer base 
in managing our balance sheet  our primary source of funding is customer deposits 
our ability to continue to attract these deposits and other funding sources is subject to variability based upon a number of factors including volume and volatility in the securities markets  our financial condition  our credit rating and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities 
the availability and level of deposits and other funding sources is highly dependent upon the perception of the liquidity and creditworthiness of the financial institution  which perception can change quickly in response to market conditions or circumstances unique to a particular company 
concerns about our past and future financial condition or concerns about our credit exposure to other persons could adversely impact our sources of liquidity  financial position  including regulatory capital ratios  results of operations and our business prospects 
if the level of deposits were to materially decrease  we would need to raise additional funds by increasing the interest that we pay on certificates of deposits or other depository accounts  seek other debt or equity financing or draw upon our available lines of credit 
we rely on commercial and retail deposits  and to a lesser extent  advances from the fhlb and the federal reserve discount window  to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if  among other things  our results of operations or financial condition or the results of operations or financial condition of the fhlb or market conditions were to change 
our line of credit with the fhlb serves as our primary outside source of liquidity 
the federal reserve discount window also serves as an additional outside source of liquidity 
borrowings under this arrangement are through the federal reserve s secondary facility and are subject to providing additional information regarding the financial condition of the bank and reasons for the borrowing 
the duration of borrowings from the federal reserve discount window are generally for a very short period  usually overnight 
in the event that these outside sources of liquidity become unavailable to us  we will need to seek additional sources of liquidity  including selling assets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell assets at a level to allow us to repay borrowings or meet our liquidity needs 
we constantly monitor our activities with respect to liquidity and evaluate closely our utilization of our cash assets  however  there can be no assurance that our liquidity or the cost of funds to us may not be materially and adversely impacted as a result of economic  market  or operational considerations that we may not be able to control 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates 
like most financial institutions  our earnings and profitability depend significantly on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us and our earnings may be negatively affected 
in light of our current volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  our net interest margin could be expected to increase during periods of rising interest rates and  conversely  to decline during periods of falling interest rates 
we are unable to predict or control fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by many factors  including the following inflation  recession  changes in unemployment  the money supply  international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets  and governmental actions 
our asset liability management strategy may not be able to control our risk from changes in market interest rates and it may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time  we may reposition our assets and liabilities to reduce our net interest income volatility 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
governmental regulation and regulatory actions against us may further impair our operations or restrict our growth 
under the compliance mou  we are required to  among other things  i improve the board of directors oversight of the bank s cms  ii ensure the establishment and implementation of the bank s cms is commensurate with the complexity of the bank s operations  iii perform a full review of all compliance policy and procedures  then revise and adopt policy and procedures to ensure compliance with all consumer protection regulations  iv enhance the bank s training program relating to consumer protection and fair lending regulations  v develop and implement an effective internal monitoring program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  vi strengthen the compliance audit function to ensure that the compliance audits are appropriately and comprehensively scoped  vii develop and implement internal controls for the bank s third party payment processing activity  viii strengthen the board of directors and senior management s oversight of third party relationships and ix enhance the bank s overdraft payment program 
we cannot assure you whether or when the company and the bank will be in full compliance with the compliance mou or whether or when the compliance mou will be terminated 
even if terminated  we may still be subject to other agreements with regulators that restrict our activities or may also continue to impose capital ratios or other requirements on our business 
the requirements and restrictions of the compliance mou are judicially enforceable and the company or the bank s failure to comply with such requirements and restrictions may subject the company and the bank to additional regulatory restrictions including the imposition of additional regulatory requirements or orders  limitations on our activities  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  and further directives which affect our business  including  in the most severe circumstances  termination of the bank s deposit insurance or appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank 
in addition to the requirements of the compliance mou  we are subject to significant governmental supervision and regulation 
these regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not security holders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
statutes and regulations affecting our business may be changed at any time and the interpretation of these statutes and regulations by examining authorities may also change 
in addition  regulations may be adopted which increase our deposit insurance premiums and enact special assessments which could increase expenses associated with running our business and adversely affect our earnings 
there can be no assurance that such changes to the statutes and regulations or to their interpretation will not adversely affect our business 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
in addition to governmental supervision and regulation  we are subject to changes in other federal and state laws  including changes in tax laws  which could materially affect the banking industry 
we are subject to the rules and regulations of the frbsf  fdic and dfi and may be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the consumer financial protection bureau which was recently created pursuant to the dodd frank act 
if we fail to comply with federal and state bank regulations  the regulators may limit our activities or growth  impose fines on us or ultimately cease our operations 
banking laws and regulations change from time to time 
bank regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated in the same manner or are less regulated 
federal and state bank regulatory agencies regulate many aspects of our operations 
these areas include the capital that must be maintained  the kinds of activities that can be engaged in  the kinds and amounts of investments that can be made  the locations of offices  insurance of deposits and the premiums that we must pay for this insurance  and how much cash we must set aside as reserves for deposits 
the dodd frank act provides for a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states 
while the full effects of the legislation on us cannot yet be determined  it could result in higher compliance and other costs as a result of new regulations and new regulatory initiatives  including changes in the documentation and underwriting of qualified mortgages  reduced revenues and higher capital and liquidity requirements  among other things  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities have the authority to bring enforcement actions against banks and bank holding companies for unsafe or unsound practices in the conduct of their businesses or for violations of any law  rule or regulation  any condition imposed in writing by the appropriate bank regulatory agency or any written agreement with the authority 
possible enforcement actions against us could include a federal conservatorship or receivership for the bank  the issuance of additional orders that could be judicially enforced  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the issuance of directives to enter into a strategic transaction  whether by merger or otherwise  with a third party  the termination of insurance of deposits  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders 
the impact of new regulatory standards will likely impose enhanced capital adequacy requirements on us 
the basel committee on banking has adopted new capital  leverage and liquidity guidelines under the basel accord and the frb has proposed new capital requirements on bank and bank holding companies  all of which may have the effect of raising our capital requirements and imposing new capital requirements beyond those required by current law and the dodd frank act 
increased regulatory capital requirements and the associated compliance costs whether due to the adoption of new laws and regulations  changes in existing laws and regulations  or more expansive or aggressive interpretations of existing laws and regulations  may have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to effectively manage the composition of our investment securities portfolio  which we expect will continue to comprise a significant portion of our earning assets  our net interest income and net interest margin could be adversely affected 
our primary sources of interest income include interest on loans and leases  as well as interest earned on investment securities 
interest earned on investment securities represented of our interest income in the year ended december  as compared to of our interest income in the year ended december  we face significant competition for loans and leases that meet our credit profile 
in addition  as part of our recovery plan  we have experienced a significant reduction in average loans and leases as we have continued our efforts to reduce our credit risk exposure  while deploying more excess cash and cash equivalents into investment securities 
accordingly  effectively managing our investment securities portfolio to generate interest income while managing the composition and risks associated with that portfolio  including the mix of government agency and non agency securities  has become increasingly important 
if we are unable to effectively manage our investment securities portfolio or if the interest income generated by our investment securities portfolio declines  our net interest income and net interest margin could be adversely affected 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our deposit customers may pursue alternatives to deposits at our bank or seek higher yielding deposits causing us to incur increased funding costs 
we are facing increasing deposit pricing pressures 
checking and savings account balances and other forms of deposits can decrease when our deposit customers perceive alternative investments  such as the stock market or other non depository investments as providing superior expected returns or seek to spread their deposits over several banks to maximize fdic insurance coverage 
furthermore  technology and other changes have made it more convenient for the bank s customers to transfer funds into alternative investments including products offered by other financial institutions or non bank service providers 
additional increases in short term interest rates could increase transfers of deposits to higher yielding deposits 
efforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits  including deposit pricing  can increase our costs 
when the bank s customers move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments or into higher yielding deposits  or spread their accounts over several banks  we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds  thus increasing our funding costs 
the fiscal  monetary and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments  both of which affect the net interest margin 
it also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold  such as debt securities 
in an effort to stimulate the economy  the federal government and its agencies have taken various steps to keep interest rates at extremely low levels 
our net interest income and net interest margin may be negatively impacted by a prolonged low interest rate environment like we are currently experiencing as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities on our balance sheet  particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets 
changes in the slope of the yield curve  which represents the spread between short term and long term interest rates  could also reduce our net interest income and net interest margin 
historically  the yield curve is upward sloping  meaning short term rates are lower than long term rates 
when the yield curve flattens  as is the case in the current interest rate environment  our net interest income and net interest margin could decrease as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets 
changes in frb policies and our regulatory environment generally are beyond our control  and we are unable to predict what changes may occur or the manner in which any future changes may affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense 
all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  beginning on july   financial institutions could commence offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients 
our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we have to offer higher rates of interest then we currently offer on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue 
because we are a holding company with no significant operations other than our bank  we depend upon dividends from our bank for a substantial portion of our revenues 
hawaii law only permits the bank to pay dividends out of retained earnings as defined under hawaii banking law statutory retained earnings  which differs from gaap retained earnings 
at december   the bank had statutory retained earnings of million 
in light of the company improved capital position and financial condition  our board of directors is currently evaluating a variety of alternatives to strategically manage the company capital levels  including the company prospects and ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders commencing in any decision to pay dividends or otherwise take any action with respect to our capital position  is subject to the discretion of our board of directors as well as any applicable regulatory and contractual limitations 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed and implemented to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
in addition  there are a limited number of qualified persons in our local marketplace with the knowledge and experience required to effectively maintain our information technology systems and implement our technology initiatives 
failure to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel  or keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to various legal claims and litigation 
from time to time  customers  employees and others that we do business with make claims and take legal action against us for various business occurrences  including the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities 
regardless of whether these claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services  as well as impact customer demand for our products and services 
any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
even if these claims and legal actions do not result in a financial liability or reputational damage  defending these claims and actions have resulted in  and will continue to result in  increased legal and professional services costs  which adds to our noninterest expense and negatively impacts our operating results 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and community banks within the various markets we operate 
additionally  various out of state banks conduct significant business in the market areas in which we currently operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings banks  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of our financial condition may also affect our competitiveness 
customers may decide not to do business with the bank due to its financial condition 
we have and continue to face additional regulatory restrictions that our competitors may not be subject to  including reducing our commercial real estate loan portfolio and improving the overall risk profile of the company  which could adversely impact our ability to compete and attract and retain customers 
our business could be adversely affected by unfavorable actions from rating agencies 
ratings assigned by ratings agencies to us  our affiliates or our securities may impact the decision of certain customers  in particular  institutions  to do business with us 
a rating downgrade or a negative rating could adversely affect our deposits and our business relationships 
on february   fitch ratings upgraded the long term issuer default rating of the company and the bank from cc to b and removed the company and the bank from rating watch evolving 
on may   fitch ratings upgraded the long term issuer default rating of the company and the bank to b from b and assigned a positive rating outlook 
on may   fitch ratings upgraded the long term issuer default rating of the company and the bank to bb from b and assigned a stable rating outlook 
however  our ratings may not improve further and may be downgraded in the future if there are adverse developments concerning our business 
we may suffer substantial losses due to our agreements to indemnify investors in the private placement against a broad range of potential claims 
in our agreements with the investors in the private placement  we agreed to indemnify the investors for a broad range of claims  including losses resulting from the inaccuracy or breach of representations or warranties made by us in such agreements and the breach by us to perform our covenants contained in such agreements 
while these indemnities are subject to various limitations  if claims were successfully brought against us  it could potentially result in significant losses for the company 
as a result of the recapitalization  carlyle and anchorage are substantial holders of our common stock 
following the closing of the recapitalization  anchorage and carlyle each became beneficial owners of our outstanding common stock  with their respective ownership percentages each equating to approximately as of december  each has a representative on our board of directors 
accordingly  anchorage and carlyle have substantial influence over the election of directors to our board and over corporate policy  including decisions to enter into mergers or other extraordinary transactions 
in addition  carlyle and anchorage have certain preemptive rights to maintain their respective fully diluted percentage ownership of our common stock in the event of certain issuances of securities by us 
in pursuing their economic interests  anchorage and carlyle may make decisions with respect to fundamental corporate transactions that may not be aligned with the interests of other shareholders 
risk factors related to our securities the market price of our common stock could decline 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are failure to comply with all of the requirements of any governmental orders or agreements we are or may become subject to and the possibility of resulting action by the regulators  deterioration of asset quality  the incurrence of losses  actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition  changes in revenue or earnings losses estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts  failure to meet analysts revenue or earnings losses estimates  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  additions or departures of key personnel  actions by institutional shareholders  fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  future sales of our common stock  including sales of our common stock in short sale transactions  general market conditions and  in particular  developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry  proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments  anticipated or pending investigations  proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us  or domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock market and  in particular  the market for financial institution stocks  have experienced significant volatility over the past few years 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur 
in addition  sales of shares by investors in the private placement may cause our share price to decrease 
accordingly  the common stock that you purchase may trade at a price lower than that at which they were purchased 
volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent individual shareholders from being able to sell their shares when they want or at prices they find attractive 
a significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation 
the transferability of our common stock is limited as a result of the tax benefits preservation plan and the protective charter amendment 
as described under risk factors related to our business our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited or restricted  we have generated significant nols as a result of our recent losses 
in order to reduce the likelihood that transactions in our common stock would result in an ownership change  on november   we adopted a tax benefits preservation plan  which provides an economic disincentive for any person or group to become an owner  for relevant tax purposes  of or more of our common stock 
to further protect our nols  we filed the protective charter amendment on may  to restrict transfers of our stock if the effect of an attempted transfer would cause the transferee to become a threshold holder or cause the beneficial ownership of a threshold holder to increase 
the protective charter amendment expires on the earliest of i may   ii such time as the board of directors determines the protective charter amendment is no longer necessary for the preservation of our tax benefits and iii the date the board of directors determines that the protective charter amendment is no longer in our and our shareholders best interest 
the tax benefits preservation plan and the protective charter amendment have the effect of limiting transferability of our common stock because they may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire our common stock under the circumstances described above and  in the case of the protective charter amendment  prohibit certain acquisitions of our common stock as described above 
these transfer restrictions may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of the company and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to consummate an acquisition of the company 
in addition  these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common shares and may limit a shareholder s ability to dispose of our common shares by reducing the class of potential acquirers for our common shares 
anti takeover provisions in our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable federal and state law may limit the ability of another party to acquire us  which could cause our stock price to decline 
various provisions of our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and certain other actions we have taken could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders 
these include  among other things  the tax benefits preservation plan  the protective charter amendment and the authorization to issue blank check preferred stock by action of the board of directors acting alone  thus without obtaining shareholder approval 
in addition  applicable provisions of federal and state law require regulatory approval in connection with certain acquisitions of our common stock and supermajority voting provisions in connection with certain transactions 
these provisions of our restated articles of incorporation and by laws and federal and state law may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to shareholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
resales of our common stock in the public market may cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
we issued a large number of common stock to the investors in the private placement 
carlyle and anchorage the lead investors have certain registration rights with respect to the common stock held by them 
the registration rights for the lead investors will allow them to sell their common stock without compliance with the volume and manner of sale limitations under rule promulgated under the securities act 
the market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by the lead investors from time to time of a substantial amount of the common stock held by them 
our common stock is equity and therefore is subordinate to our subsidiaries indebtedness and preferred stock 
our common stock constitutes equity interests and does not constitute indebtedness 
as such  common stock will rank junior to all current and future indebtedness and other non equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us  including in the event of our liquidation 
we may  and the bank and our other subsidiaries may also  incur additional indebtedness from time to time and may increase our aggregate level of outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   we had million in face amount of trust preferred securities outstanding and accrued and unpaid dividends thereon of million 
additionally  holders of common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock that may be outstanding from time to time 
the board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders 
if we issue preferred shares in the future that have a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  then the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
there is a limited trading market for our common stock and as a result  you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for them 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nyse  the volume of trading in our common shares is lower than many other companies listed on the nyse 
a public trading market with depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
our common stock is not insured and you could lose the value of your entire investment 
an investment in our common stock is not a deposit and is not insured against loss by the government
