table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of east west bancorp  inc and its subsidiaries 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in addition  certain accounting policies require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income 
fair value of financial instruments fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques  we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with a three level hierarchy ie  level  level and level 
fair value determination requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
in determining the fair value of financial instruments  we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available 
we do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
additionally  fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with asc  financial instruments 
investment securities the accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities and by comparison to and or average of quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
the company performs a monthly analysis on the broker quotes and pricing service values received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
the company ensures prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads and  when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize proprietary models that include observable market based inputs 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 

table of contents for broker prices obtained on certain investment securities that we believe are based on forced liquidation or distressed sale values in inactive markets  we individually examine these securities for the appropriate valuation methodology based on a combination of the market approach reflecting current broker prices and a discounted cash flow approach 
in calculating the fair value derived from the income approach  the company makes assumptions using an exit price approach related to the implied rate of return which have been adjusted for general change in market rates  estimated changes in credit risk and liquidity risk premium  specific nonperformance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security 
the values resulting from each approach ie market and income approaches are weighted to derive the final fair value for each security trading in an inactive market 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
if we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  a credit related impairment loss is recognized in current earnings 
noncredit related impairment losses are charged to other comprehensive income  to the extent we intend to hold the security until recovery 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment related factors are examined to assess impairment which include the nature of the investments  severity and duration of the loss  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  an analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
we take into consideration the financial resources  intent and the overall ability of the company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows and making its other than temporary impairment assessment for its portfolio of trust preferred securities 
the company considers factors such as remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  expected defaults  the financial condition of the issuer s  and the value of any underlying collateral 
acquired loans acquired loans are initially recorded as of acquisition date at fair value in accordance with asc  business combinations 
loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are accounted for under asc  receivables loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
further  the company elected to account for all other acquired loans within the scope of asc using the same methodology 
an allowance for loan losses is not carried over or recorded as of the acquisition date 
in situations where loans have similar risk characteristics  loans were aggregated into pools to estimate cash flows under asc a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single interest rate  cumulative loss rate and cash flow expectation 
the company aggregated all of the loans acquired in the fdic assisted acquisitions of wfib and ucb into different pools  based on common risk characteristics 
the cash flows expected over the life of the pools are estimated using an internal cash flow model that projects cash flows and calculates the carrying values of the pools  book yields  effective interest income and impairment  if any  based on pool level events 
assumptions as to cumulative loss rates  loss curves and prepayment speeds are utilized to calculate the expected cash flows 
under asc  the excess of the expected cash flows at acquisition over the recorded investment is considered to be the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the life of the loan or pool 
the excess of the contractual cash flows over the expected cash flows is considered to be the nonaccretable difference 
subsequent to the acquisition date  any increases in cash flow over those expected at purchase date in excess of the fair value that are probable are recorded as an adjustment to the accretable difference on a prospective basis 
any subsequent decreases in cash flow over those expected at purchase date that are probable are recognized by recording an allowance for loan losses 
any disposals of loans  including sales of loans  payments in full or foreclosures result in the removal of the loan from the asc portfolio at the carrying amount 

table of contents the majority of the loans acquired in the fdic assisted acquisitions of wfib and ucb are included in the fdic shared loss agreements and are referred to as covered loans 
covered loans are reported exclusive of the expected cash flow reimbursements from the fdic 
at the date of acquisition  all covered loans were accounted for under asc and asc fdic indemnification asset in conjunction with the fdic assisted acquisitions of wfib and ucb  the bank entered into shared loss agreements with the fdic for amounts receivable covered by the shared loss agreements 
at the date of the acquisition the company elected to account for amounts receivable under the shared loss agreements as an indemnification asset in accordance with asc subsequent to the acquisition the indemnification asset is tied to the loss in the covered loans and is not being accounted for under fair value 
the fdic indemnification asset is accounted for on the same basis as the related covered loans and is the present value of the cash flows the company expects to collect from the fdic under the shared loss agreements 
the difference between the present value and the undiscounted cash flow the company expects to collect from the fdic is accreted into noninterest income over the life of the fdic indemnification asset 
the fdic indemnification asset is adjusted for any changes in expected cash flows based on the loan performance 
any increases in cash flow of the loans over those expected will reduce the fdic indemnification asset and any decreases in cash flow of the loans over those expected will increase the fdic indemnification asset 
over the life of the fdic indemnification asset  increases and decreases are recorded as adjustments to noninterest income 
in december  the bank lowered the credit discount on the ucb covered loan portfolio as the credit quality was performing better than originally estimated 
by lowering the credit discount  interest income will increase over the life of the loans 
correspondingly  with the lowered credit discount  the expected reimbursement from the fdic under the loss sharing agreement will decrease  resulting in amortization on the fdic indemnification asset which is recorded as a charge to noninterest income 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
qualitative considerations include  but are not limited to  prevailing economic or market conditions  relative risk profiles of various loan segments  volume concentrations  growth trends  delinquency and nonaccrual status  problem loan trends  and geographic concentrations 
for a detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss methodology see management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations allowance for loan losses presented elsewhere in this report 
as we add new products  increase the complexity of our loan portfolio  and expand our geographic coverage  we continue to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio and the changing credit environment 
changes in any of the factors cited above could have a significant impact on the loan loss calculation 
we believe that our methodologies continue to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
this discussion should also be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level which is the same level as the company s two major operating segments identified in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the first part of the test is a comparison  at the reporting unit level  of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
in order to determine the fair value of the reporting units  a combined income approach and market approach was used 
under the income approach  the company provided a net income projection and a terminal growth rate was used to calculate the discounted cash flows and the present value of the reporting units 
under the market approach  the fair value was calculated using the current fair values of comparable peer banks of similar size  geographic footprint and focus 
the market capitalizations and multiples of these peer banks were used to calculate the market price of the company and each reporting unit 
the fair value was also subject to a control premium adjustment  which is the cost savings that a purchase of the reporting unit could achieve by eliminating duplicative costs 
under the combined income and market approach  the value from each approach was appropriately weighted to determine the fair value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the second part of the test is needed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated and compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill recorded within the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  then the company would recognize an impairment loss for the amount of the difference  which would be recorded as a charge against net income

table of contents share based compensation we account for share based awards to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with the provisions of asc  equity  and asc  compensation stock compensation 
share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we grant nonqualified stock options and restricted stock  which include a service condition for vesting 
additionally  some of our stock awards include a company financial performance requirement for vesting 
the stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date  while the restricted stock awards generally vest in three to five years from the date of grant 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award  which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award 
we use an option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of our stock options which is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
we make assumptions regarding expected term  expected volatility  expected dividend yield  and risk free interest rate in determining the fair value of our stock options 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term assumption is estimated based on the stock options vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees historical exercise behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s current dividend payout rate on its common stock 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant appropriate for the term of the employee stock options 
for restricted share awards  the grant date fair value is measured at the fair value of the company s common stock as if the restricted share was vested and issued on the date of grant 
as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are reviewed annually for reasonableness 
if the estimated forfeitures are revised  a cumulative effect of a change in estimated forfeitures for current and prior periods are recognized in compensation cost in the period of change 
share based compensation is discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report

table of contents the covered loan portfolio is comprised of loans acquired from the fdic assisted acquisitions of ucb and wfib which are covered under loss share agreements with the fdic 
for the full year  we recorded a net decrease in the fdic indemnification asset and receivable included in noninterest loss income of million  largely due to continued improved credit performance of the ucb portfolio as compared to our original estimate 
the company reported total noninterest loss for the full year of million  a decrease from noninterest income of million as compared to the decrease in noninterest loss income from the prior year was primarily attributable to an increase in the net reduction of the fdic indemnification asset and fdic receivable

analysis of changes in net interest income changes in our net interest income are a function of changes in rates and volumes of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense for the years indicated 
the total change for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is segmented into the change attributable to variations in volume changes in volume multiplied by old rate and the change attributable to variations in interest rates changes in rates multiplied by old volume

however  the non covered allowance for loan losses on commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and consumer portfolio did increase which is commensurate with the increases in these portfolios 
we continue to aggressively monitor delinquencies and proactively review the credit risk exposure of our loan portfolio to minimize and mitigate potential losses 
also during the year we had note sale proceeds of million on notes with a carrying value of million 
million in loans were originated to facilitate sales of loans  the remaining difference between the carrying value and the sale amount was charged against the allowance for loan losses 
comparing to  the decrease in loan loss provisions during reflects decreased charge off levels as a result of the credit quality improvement 
however  the allowance for loan losses on commercial and residential loans did increase which is commensurate with the increases in these portfolios 
provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for credit losses as well as the allowance for unfunded loan commitments  off balance sheet credit exposures  and recourse provisions to a level deemed appropriate by the company based on the factors discussed under the allowance for loan losses section of this report

accordingly  a valuation allowance has been recorded for these amounts 
as of december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of million 

table of contents operating segment results we define our operating segments based on our core strategy and we have three operating segments retail banking  commercial banking and other 
the retail banking segment focuses primarily on retail operations through the bank s branch network

table of contents investment securities income from investing activities provides a significant portion of our total income 
we aim to maintain an investment portfolio with an adequate mix of fixed rate and adjustable rate securities with relatively short maturities to minimize overall interest rate risk 
our investment securities portfolio primarily consists of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  us government sponsored enterprise debt securities  us government sponsored enterprise and other mortgage backed securities  municipal securities  and corporate debt securities 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at their estimated fair values with the corresponding changes in fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  net of tax  as a component of stockholders equity 
all investment securities have been classified as available for sale as of december  and december  total investment securities available for sale decreased to billion as of december   compared with billion at december  as of december   the investment portfolio had a net unrealized gain of million as compared to a net unrealized loss of million as of december  within the portfolio  all categories by security type were in a net unrealized gain position except for corporate debt 
during  total repayments maturities and proceeds from sales of investment securities amounted to billion and billion  respectively 
proceeds from repayments  maturities  sales  and redemptions were applied towards additional investment securities purchases totaling billion 
we recorded net gains totaling thousand and million on sales of investment securities during and  respectively 
at december   investment securities available for sale with a par value of billion were pledged to secure public deposits  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  frb discount window  and for other purposes required or permitted by law 
the corporate debt securities portfolio was reduced by million during primarily due to the sales stated above 
during  the company reassessed the investment portfolio and elected to sell these securities to reduce the exposure to specific industries within the corporate debt securities portfolio 
for the remainder of the corporate debt securities portfolio held as of december   the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the securities before it recovers the cost basis of its investment 
we perform regular impairment analyses on the investment securities 
if we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  a credit related impairment loss is recognized in current earnings 
the noncredit related impairment losses are charged to other comprehensive income which is the portion of the loss attributed to market rates or other factors non credit related 
other than temporary declines in fair value are assessed based on factors including the duration the security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position  the severity of the decline in value  the rating of the security  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  and our ability and intent to not sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
for securities that are determined to not have other than temporary declines in value  we have both the ability and the intent to hold these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or prices obtained from independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
the company performs a monthly analysis on the pricing service quotes and the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and ongoing review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
the company assesses whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed that are based on spreads and  when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations that utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 
as a result of the financial crisis in the us and global markets  the market for certain pooled trust preferred securities has been distressed since mid it is the company s view that current broker prices which are typically non binding on these securities are based on forced liquidation or distressed sale values in very inactive markets that are not representative of the fair value of these securities 
as such  the company considered what weight  if any  to place on transactions that are not orderly when estimating fair value 

table of contents there were individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or longer as of december  these securities are comprised of investment grade debt securities and with a total fair value of million and positions in trust preferred securities with a total fair value of million 
the company recorded other than temporary impairment losses in of thousand on our portfolio of trust preferred securities

the difference between the present value of undiscounted cash flow the company expects to collect from the fdic is accreted into noninterest income over the life of the fdic indemnification asset 
the fdic indemnification asset was million as of december   compared to million as of december  for the years ended december  and  the company recorded million and million  respectively  of amortization in line with the improved accretable yield as discussed in note presented elsewhere in this report 
the company also recorded a million and million reduction for the years ended december  and  respectively  to the fdic indemnification asset and recorded the adjustment to noninterest income loss 
the reduction in both years is primarily the result of covered loan payoffs 
as these covered loans are removed from their respective pools  the company records a proportional amount of accretable yield into interest income 
correspondingly  the company removes the indemnification asset associated with those removed loans and the adjustments are recorded into noninterest income 
additionally  during and  respectively  million and million were recorded as the increase in the estimate of liability owed to the fdic at the completion of the fdic loss share agreements

we evaluate loan impairment according to the provisions of asc  receivables overall subsequent measurement 
under asc  loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses

the migration analysis looks at pools of loans having similar characteristics and analyzes their loss rates over a historical period 
we utilize historical loss factors derived from trends and losses associated with each pool over a specified period of time 
based on this process  we assign loss factors to each loan grade within each pool of loans 
loss rates derived by the migration model are based predominantly on historical loss trends that may not be indicative of the actual or inherent loss potential 
as such  we utilize qualitative and environmental factors as adjusting mechanisms to supplement the historical results of the classification migration model 
qualitative considerations include  but are not limited to  prevailing economic or market conditions  relative risk profiles of various loan segments  volume concentrations  growth trends  delinquency and nonaccrual status  problem loan trends  and geographic concentrations 
qualitative and environmental factors are reflected as percent adjustments and are added to the historical loss rates derived from the classified asset migration model to determine the appropriate allowance amount for each loan pool

table allowance for loan losses by loan segment and at december  amount amount dollars in thousands residential commercial real estate commercial and industrial consumer covered loans subject to general reserves total the increase of million in the allowance for loan losses at december   relative to year end  was primarily due to increases in the allowance for loan losses on commercial and industrial loans  commensurate with the increase in the portfolio 
deposits we offer a wide variety of deposit account products to both consumer and commercial customers 
total deposits increased million to billion at december   as compared to billion at december  the increase in total deposits was due to increases of billion in noninterest bearing demand deposits  million in money market accounts  million in interest bearing checking accounts  million in deposits  respectively 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of billion  or  in time deposits 
during  we grew deposits from our retail network and commercial customers by billion and decreased brokered deposits by million 
as of december   time deposits within the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program decreased to million  compared to million at december  the cdars program allows customers with deposits in excess of fdic insured limits to obtain full coverage on time deposits through a network of banks within the cdars program 
additionally  we partner with another financial institution to offer a retail sweep product for non time deposit accounts to provide added deposit insurance coverage for deposits in excess of fdic insured limits 
deposits gathered through these programs are considered brokered deposits under current regulatory reporting guidelines 
public deposits increased to billion at december   from million at december  a large portion of these public funds are comprised of deposits from the state of california 
time deposits greater than thousand were billion  representing of the deposit portfolio at december  these accounts  consisting primarily of deposits by consumers  had a weighted average interest rate of at december  the following table provides the remaining maturities at december  of time deposits greater than thousand table time deposits  or greater in thousands months or less over months through months over months through months over months total 
table of contents borrowings we utilize a combination of short term and long term borrowings to manage our liquidity position 
we had no federal funds purchased at the years ended december  and december  fhlb advances decreased to million as of december   compared to million at december  the decrease in fhlb advances is consistent with our overall strategy to reduce our cost of funds 
during  long term fhlb advances totaling million were prepaid  with prepayment penalties of million 
also in  the company modified million and million of fixed rate fhlb advances into adjustable rate  reducing the effective interest rate on these borrowings by basis points and basis points  respectively 
the remainder of the decrease in fhlb advances is due to a million modification cost incurred by the company during that has been deferred and treated as a discount on the corresponding debt 
in addition to fhlb advances  we also utilize securities sold under repurchase agreements repurchase agreements to manage our liquidity position 
repurchase agreements totaled million and billion as of december  and  respectively 
included in these balances were million in short term repurchase agreements as of december  no short term repurchase agreements were outstanding as of december  during  the company modified million and million of long term repurchase agreements  extending the terms and reducing the rate of these agreements by basis points and basis points  respectively 
the interest rates for the long term repurchase agreements are largely fixed ranging from to as of december  the counterparties have the right to a quarterly call for many of the repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold 
the collateral for these agreements consist of us government agency and us government sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage backed securities 
long term debt long term debt comprised of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt decreased million or to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the decrease was a result of the company paying off million of subordinated debt carrying an effective interest rate of  and incurring a prepayment penalty of thousand during as of december   long term debt is comprised of junior subordinated debt  which qualifies as tier i capital for regulatory purposes  issued in connection with our various pooled trust preferred securities offerings

off balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements whereby an unconsolidated entity is a party  under which we have any obligation under a guarantee contract  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 

table of contents commitments as a financial service provider  we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit to customers  such as loan commitments  commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade  standby letters of credit  and financial guarantees 
many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
the same credit policies are used in extending these commitments as in extending loan facilities to customers 
under some of these contractual agreements  the company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
a schedule of significant commitments to extend credit to customers as of december  is as follows table significant commitments december  in thousands undisbursed loan commitments standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit a discussion of significant contractual arrangements under which the company may be held contingently liable is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report

historically  our primary source of capital has been the retention of operating earnings 
in order to ensure adequate levels of capital  we conduct an ongoing assessment of projected sources  needs and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and level of risk 
as part of this ongoing assessment  the board of directors reviews the various components of capital and the adequacy of capital 

table of contents series a preferred stock offering in april  the company issued  shares of non cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock  series a series a  with a liquidation preference of  per share 
the company received million of additional tier qualifying capital  after deducting stock issuance costs 
the proceeds from this offering were used to augment the company s liquidity and capital positions and reduce its borrowings 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
risk based capital we are committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to assure our shareholders  our customers and our regulators that our company and our bank subsidiary are financially sound 
we are subject to risk based capital regulations and capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures 
according to these guidelines  institutions whose tier i and total capital ratios meet or exceed and  respectively  may be deemed well capitalized 
at december   the bank s tier i and total capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december  the following table compares east west bancorp  inc s and east west bank s actual capital ratios at december   to those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well capitalized classification purposes table regulatory required ratios minimum well east west east west regulatory capitalized bancorp bank requirements requirements total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets asset liability and market risk management liquidity liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the bank  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco  and issuances of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans and securities 
in addition  government programs  such as the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  may influence deposit behavior 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december   and  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
net cash inflows from operating activities were primarily due to net income earned during the year 
net cash outflows inflows from investing activities totaled million  billion and million during   and  respectively 
net cash outflow from investing activities for and were primarily due to purchases of securities purchased under resale agreements and investment securities available for sale 
net cash inflows from investment activities for was primarily due to repayment  redemption and sales of investment securities offset by purchases of investment securities 

table of contents during the years ended december  and  we experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of million and million  respectively 
net cash inflows from financing activities for and were primarily due to the increase in deposits 
during  we had net cash outflows from financing activities of million primarily due to repayment of fhlb advances 
as a means of augmenting our liquidity  we have available a combination of borrowing sources comprised of the federal reserve bank s discount window  fhlb advances  federal funds lines with various correspondent banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate to meet our day to day cash flow requirements 
at december   we are not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that had or were reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
as of december   we are not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
the liquidity of east west bancorp  inc has historically been dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  east west bank  subject to applicable statutes  regulations and special approval 
for the years ended december  and  total dividends paid by the bank to east west bancorp  inc amounted to million and million  respectively 
in january  million in dividends were upstreamed to east west bancorp 
on january   the board of directors declared first quarter dividends on the company s common stock and series a preferred stock of and the board of directors authorized common stock dividends of per share for the first quarter of interest rate sensitivity management our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk  which is the impact of adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value 
the fundamental objective of the asset liability management process is to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
our strategy is formulated by the asset liability committee  which coordinates with the board of directors to monitor our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee meets regularly to evaluate  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio including those attributable to hedging transactions  if any  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
our overall strategy is to minimize the adverse impact of immediate incremental changes in market interest rates rate shock on net interest income and net portfolio value 
net portfolio value is defined as the present value of assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the attainment of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk exposure 
to minimize the adverse impact of changes in market interest rates  we simulate the effect of instantaneous interest rate changes on net interest income and net portfolio value on a quarterly basis 
the table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of equity as of december  and  assuming a non parallel shift of and basis points in both directions table rate shock table net interest income net portfolio value volatility volatility change in interest rates december  december  december  december  basis points the percentage change represents net interest income for twelve months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 

table of contents all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  and in a declining rate environment  the interest rate floors on these loans contribute to the favorable impact on our net interest income 
however  in a rising rate environment  these interest rate floors also serve to lessen the full benefit of higher interest rates 
at december  and  our estimated changes in net interest income and net portfolio value were within the ranges established by the board of directors 
our primary analytical tool to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators  and is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to predict changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model and other available public sources are incorporated into the model 
adjustments are made to reflect the shift in the treasury and other appropriate yield curves 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels by product line and takes into account our increased ability to control rates offered on deposit products in comparison to our ability to control rates on adjustable rate loans tied to the published indices 
the following table provides the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average interest rates of our financial instruments as of december  the information presented below is based on the repricing date for variable rate instruments and the expected maturity date for fixed rate instruments 
table expected maturity for financial instruments expected maturity or repricing date by year year year year year year thereafter total dollars in thousands assets cd investments average yield fixed rate short term investments weighted average rate securities purchased under resale agreements weighted average rate investment securities weighted average rate total covered gross loans weighted average rate total non covered gross loans weighted average rate liabilities checking accounts weighted average rate money market accounts weighted average rate savings deposits weighted average rate time deposits weighted average rate fhlb advances weighted average rate securities sold under repurchase agreements fixed rate weighted average rate securities sold under repurchase agreements variable rate weighted average rate junior subordinated debt variable rate weighted average rate other borrowings weighted average rate expected maturities of assets are contractual maturities adjusted for projected payment based on contractual amortization and unscheduled prepayments of principal as well as repricing frequency 
expected maturities for deposits are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected rollover rates for deposits with no stated maturity dates 
we utilize assumptions supported by documented analyses for the expected maturities of our loans and repricing of our deposits 
we also use prepayment projections for amortizing securities 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary significantly if future prepayments and repricing frequencies differ from our expectations based on historical experience 

table of contents the fair values of interest bearing deposits in other banks are based on the discounted cash flow approach 
the discount rate is derived from the bank s time deposit rate curve 
the fair values of short term investments generally approximate their book values due to their short maturities 
for securities purchased under resale agreements  fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates utilizing estimated market discount rates and taking into consideration the call features of each instrument 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or prices obtained from independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has reviewed the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
for the pooled trust preferred securities  the fair value was derived based on discounted cash flow analyses 
the discount rate is derived from assumptions using an exit pricing approach related to the implied rate of return which have been adjusted for general changes in market rates  estimated changes in credit quality and liquidity risk premiums  and specific nonperformance and default experience in the collateral underlying the securities 
the fair value of deposits is determined based on the discounted cash flow approach 
the discount rate is derived from the associated yield curve  plus spread  if any 
for core deposits  the cash outflows are projected by the decay rate based on the bank s core deposit premium study 
cash flows for all non time deposits are discounted using the libor yield curve 
for time deposits  the cash flows are based on the contractual runoff and are discounted by the bank s current offering rates  plus spread 
for federal funds purchased  fair value approximates book value due to their short maturities 
the fair value of fhlb term advances is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity or the next repricing date based on current rates offered by the fhlb for borrowings with similar maturities 
customer repurchase agreements  which have maturities ranging from one to three days  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interests rates paid on these instruments are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair values of securities sold under repurchase agreements are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates  utilizing estimated market discount rates and taking into consideration the call features of each instrument 
for junior subordinated debt instruments  fair values are estimated by discounting cash flows through maturity based on current market rates the bank would pay for new issuances 
the asset liability committee is authorized to utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
we may elect to use derivative financial instruments as part of our asset and liability management strategy  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin and stockholders equity 
currently  derivative instruments do not have a material effect on our operating results or financial position
