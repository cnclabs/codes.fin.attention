some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview world energy offers a range of energy management solutions to commercial and industrial businesses  institutions  utilities  and governments to reduce their overall energy costs 
we come to market with a holistic approach to energy management helping customers a contract for the lowest price for energy  b engage in energy efficiency projects to minimize quantity used and c maximize available rebate and incentive programs 
we made our mark on the industry with an innovative approach to procurement via our state of the art online auction platform  the world energy exchange 
engaging new customers while also pursuing more cross selling opportunities for our procurement services 
the company is also taking its suite of solutions to the rapidly growing small and medium sized customer markets 
we provide energy management services utilizing state of the art technology and the experience of a seasoned management team to bring lower energy costs to its customers 
we use a simple equation e p q i to help customers to understand the holistic nature of the energy management problem 
total energy cost e is a function of energy price p times the quantity of energy consumed q  minus any rebates or incentives i the customer can earn 
this approach not only makes energy management more approachable for customers  simplifying what has become an increasingly dynamic and complex problem  it also highlights the inter related nature of the energy management challenge 
we assert that point solution vendors may optimize one of the three elements  but it takes looking at the problem holistically to unlock the most savings 
acquisitions acquisitions are an important component of our business strategy 
our focus is on both our core procurement business as well as new product lines within the energy management services industry such as energy efficiency services 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain obligations of northeast energy partners  llc nep pursuant to an asset purchase agreement the asset purchase agreement between the company  nep  and its members 
nep is a connecticut based energy management and procurement company 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash and a million promissory note with nep the nep note 
the nep note bears interest at with million of principal plus interest due on october  and the remaining  of principal plus interest due april  nep may also earn up to an additional  in cash and shares  with up to million in cash  and  in shares based on achieving certain month revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda targets  as defined 
the nep note is unsecured and subordinated to financing with silicon valley bank svb 
the company financed this acquisition through the use of long term debt 
we borrowed million in the form of a month term loan from svb and million in the form of a year subordinated note from massachusetts capital resource company mcrc 
during the third and fourth quarters of we acquired the energy procurement business of co exprise  inc co exprise  northeast energy solutions  llc nes and gse consulting  lp gse 
we paid million and issued million shares of common stock to acquire these businesses 
in addition  we entered into seller notes of million and agreed to pay million in the form of earn outs if certain performance achievements were attained post acquisition 
during  we repaid the full million of seller notes and million of the earn outs 
these acquisitions expanded our capabilities in the energy efficiency segment  enabled the company to enter the growing small and medium sized customer energy procurement marketplaces  and consolidate the large commercial  industrial and government auction space 

table of contents with the acquisition of nes  we are managing the business as two business segments energy procurement and energy efficiency services 
our business model is heavily dependent on our people 
we have significantly grown our employee base from at our initial public offering in november to a current high of at december  this planned investment has been  and will continue to be  a key component of our strategic initiatives and revenue growth 
while these infrastructure investments result in increased operating costs in the short term  once they commence to generate incremental revenue the operating leverage within our business model results in positive cash flow and profitability although there can be no assurances of this 
to date we have funded our acquisitions and strategic investments primarily with cash on hand  notes payable  cash from operations and  most recently  long term notes payable 
we have also deferred portions of the purchase prices through the use of earn outs that are tied to ongoing performance of the acquired entity 
through the utilization of seller notes and earn outs  we have been able to finance a portion of the cost of the acquisitions over time with the targets ongoing cash flow generation 
these activities will increase our operating costs both in the short and long term and may require us to borrow against our current credit facility and or raise funds through additional capital raises 
operations revenue retail electricity transactions we earn a monthly commission on energy sales contracted through our online auction platform from each bidder or energy supplier based on the energy usage transacted between the bidder and lister or energy consumer 
our commissions are not based on the retail price for electricity  rather on the amount of energy consumed 
commissions are calculated based on the volume of energy usage transacted between the energy supplier and energy consumer multiplied by our contractual commission rate 
our contractual commission rate is negotiated with the energy consumer on a procurement by procurement basis based on energy consumer specific circumstances  including the size of auction  the effort required to organize and run the respective auction and competitive factors  among others 
once the contractual commission is agreed to with the energy consumer  all energy suppliers participating in the auction agree to that rate 
that commission rate remains fixed for the duration of the contractual term regardless of energy usage 
energy consumers provide us with a letter of authorization to request their usage history from the local utility 
we then use this data to compile a usage profile for that energy consumer that will become the basis for the auction 
this data may also be used to estimate revenue on a going forward basis  as noted below 
historically  our revenue and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations are primarily due to the buying patterns of our wholesale and natural gas customers  which tend to have large  seasonal purchases during the fourth and first quarters and electricity usage having higher demand in our second and third quarters 
in addition  the activity levels on the world energy exchange can fluctuate due to a number of factors  including market prices  weather conditions  energy consumers credit ratings  the ability of suppliers to obtain financing in credit markets  and economic and geopolitical events 
to the extent these factors affect the purchasing decisions of energy consumers our future results of operations may be affected 
contracts between energy suppliers and energy consumers are signed for a variety of term lengths  with a one to two year contract term being typical for commercial and industrial energy consumers  and government contracts typically having two to three year terms 
we do not invoice our electricity energy suppliers for monthly commissions earned and  therefore  we report a substantial portion of our receivables as unbilled 
unbilled accounts receivable represents management s best estimate of energy provided by the energy suppliers to the energy consumers for a specific completed time period at contracted commission rates and is made up of two components 
the first component represents energy usage for which we have received actual data from the supplier and or the utility  but for which payment has not been received at the balance sheet date 
the majority of our contractual relationships with energy suppliers require them to supply actual usage data to us on a monthly basis and remit payment to us based on that usage 
the second component represents energy usage for which we have not received actual data  but for which we have estimated usage 
commissions paid in advance by certain bidders are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized to commission revenue on a monthly basis on the energy exchanged that month 
retail natural gas transactions there are two primary fee components to our retail natural gas services transaction fees and management fees 
transaction fees are billed to and paid by the energy supplier awarded business on the platform 
these fees are established prior to award and are the same for each supplier 
for the majority of our natural gas transactions  we bill the supplier upon the conclusion of the transaction based on the estimated energy volume transacted for the entire award term multiplied by the transaction fee 
management fees are paid by our energy consumers and are generally billed on a monthly basis for services rendered based on terms and conditions included in contractual arrangements 
while substantially all of our retail natural gas transactions are accounted for in accordance with this policy  a certain percentage is accounted for as the natural gas is consumed by the energy consumer and recognized as revenue in accordance with the retail electricity transaction revenue recognition methodology described above 

table of contents mid market transactions we earn a monthly commission on energy sales from each energy supplier based on the energy usage transacted between the energy supplier and energy consumer 
the commissions are not based on the retail price for electricity but rather on the amount of energy consumed 
commissions are calculated based on the energy usage transacted between the energy supplier and energy consumer multiplied by our contractual commission rate 
revenue from commissions is recognized as earned over the life of each contract as energy is consumed  provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  has been successfully demonstrated 
we generally recognize revenue on these transactions when we have received verification from the electricity supplier of the end users power usage and electricity supplier s subsequent collection of the fees billed to the end user 
the verification is generally accompanied with payment of the agreed upon fee to us  at which time the revenue is recognized 
commissions paid in advance are recorded as customer advances and are recognized monthly as commission revenue based on the energy exchanged that month 
to the extent we do not receive verification of actual energy usage or we cannot reliably estimate what actual energy usage was for a given period  revenue is deferred until usage and collection data is received from the energy supplier 
demand response transactions demand response transaction fees are recognized when we have received confirmation from the demand response provider drp that the energy consumer has performed under the applicable regional transmission organization rto or independent system operator iso program requirements 
the energy consumer is either called to perform during an actual curtailment event or is required to demonstrate its ability to perform in a test event during the performance period 
for the pjm interconnection pjm  an rto that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of states and the district of columbia  the performance period is june through september in a calendar year 
test results are submitted to the pjm by the drps and we receive confirmation of the energy consumer s performance in the fourth quarter 
drps typically pay us ratably on a quarterly basis throughout the demand response fiscal june to may year 
as a result  a portion of the revenue we recognize is reflected as unbilled accounts receivable 
wholesale and environmental commodity transactions wholesale transaction fees are invoiced upon the conclusion of the auction based on a fixed fee 
these revenues are not tied to future energy usage and are recognized upon the completion of the online auction 
for reverse auctions where our customers bid for a consumer s business  the fees are paid by the bidder 
for forward auctions where a lister is selling energy products  the fees are typically paid by the lister 
while substantially all wholesale transactions are accounted for in this fashion  a small percentage of our wholesale revenue is accounted for as electricity or gas is delivered  similar to the retail electricity transaction methodology described above 
environmental commodity transaction fees are accounted for utilizing two primary methods 
for regulated allowance programs like rggi  fees are paid by the lister and are recognized quarterly as revenue as auctions are completed and approved 
for most other environmental commodity transactions both the lister and the bidder pay the transaction fee and revenue is recognized upon the consummation of the underlying transaction as credits are delivered by the lister and payment is made by the bidder 
energy efficiency services our energy efficiency services segment is primarily project driven where we identify efficiency measures that energy consumers can implement to reduce their energy usage 
we present retrofit opportunities to customers  get approval from them to proceed and submit the proposal to the local utility for cost reimbursement 
once the utility approves funding for the project  we install the equipment  typically new heating  ventilation or air conditioning equipment  or replace lighting fixtures to more efficient models 
we recognize revenue for energy efficiency services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
due to the short term nature of projects typically two to three weeks  we utilize the completed contract method 
we also assess multiple contracts entered into by the same customer in close proximity to determine if the contracts should be combined for revenue recognition purposes 
revenues are recognized based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries  employee benefits and stock based compensation associated with our auction management and efficiency services  which are directly related to the development and production of the online auction and maintenance of market related data on our auction platform and monthly management fees our supply desk function  project costs including direct labor equipment and materials directly associated with efficiency projects  and rent  depreciation and other related overhead and facility related costs 

table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and stock based compensation related to sales and marketing personnel  third party commission expenses to our channel partners  travel and related expenses  amortization related to customer relationships and contracts  rent  depreciation and other related overhead and facility related costs  and general marketing costs such as trade shows  marketing materials and outsourced services 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and stock based compensation related to general and administrative personnel  accounting  legal  investor relations  information technology  insurance and other professional fees  and rent  depreciation and other related overhead and facility related costs 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash held in the bank  and interest expense related to bank term loans  note payable and contingent consideration 
income tax expense we had incurred net operating tax losses nol s through against which we had provided a full valuation allowance 
we have had taxable income for the past three years and have applied our nol s against this taxable income up to certain limitations 
the income tax expense recorded in and reflect an alternative minimum tax amt liability and certain state and local tax liabilities incurred in those years 
management considered the weight of all available evidence  both positive and negative  and determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to benefit our deferred tax assets at december  and  as a result  we reversed our valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of at december   we reflected a deferred tax asset of approximately million

we record brokerage commissions based on actual usage data obtained from the energy supplier for that accounting period  or to the extent actual usage data is not available  based on the estimated amount of electricity and gas delivered to the energy consumers for that accounting period 
we develop our estimates on a quarterly basis based on the following criteria payments received prior to the issuance of the financial statements  usage updates from energy suppliers  usage data from utilities  comparable historical usage data  and historical variances to previous estimates 
to the extent usage data cannot be obtained  we estimate revenue as follows historical usage data obtained from the energy consumer in conjunction with the execution of the auction  geographic utility usage patterns based on actual data received  analysis of prior year usage patterns  and specific review of individual energy supplier location accounts 
in addition  we analyze this estimated data based on overall industry trends including prevailing weather and usage data 
once the actual data is received  we adjust the estimated accounts receivable and revenue to the actual total amount in the period during which the payment is received 
based on management s current capacity to obtain actual energy usage  we currently estimate four to six weeks of revenue at the end of its accounting period 
differences between estimated and actual revenue have been within management s expectations and have not been material to date 
we do not invoice our electricity energy suppliers for monthly commissions earned and  therefore  we report a substantial portion of our receivables as unbilled 
unbilled accounts receivable represents management s best estimate of energy provided by the energy suppliers to the energy consumers for a specific completed time period at contracted commission rates and is made up of two components 
the first component represents energy usage for which we have received actual data from the supplier and or the utility but for which payment has not been received at the balance sheet date 
the majority of our contractual relationships with energy suppliers require them to supply actual usage data to us on a monthly basis and remit payment to us based on that usage 
the second component represents energy usage for which we have not received actual data  but for which we have estimated usage 
commissions paid in advance by certain energy suppliers are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized to commission revenue on a monthly basis on the energy exchanged that month 
retail natural gas transactions there are two primary fee components to our retail natural gas services transaction fees and management fees 
transaction fees are billed to and paid by the energy supplier awarded business on the platform 
these fees are established prior to award and are the same for each supplier 
for the majority of our natural gas transactions  the supplier is billed upon the conclusion of the transaction based on the estimated energy volume transacted for the entire award term multiplied by the transaction fee 
management fees are paid by our energy consumers and are generally billed on a monthly basis for services rendered based on terms and conditions included in contractual arrangements 
while substantially all of our retail natural gas transactions are accounted for in accordance with this policy  a certain percentage are accounted for as the natural gas is consumed by the customer and recognized as revenue in accordance with the retail electricity transaction revenue recognition methodology described above 
mid market transactions we earn a monthly commission on energy sales from each energy supplier based on the energy usage transacted between the energy supplier and energy consumer 
the commissions are not based on the retail price for electricity but rather on the amount of energy consumed 
commissions are calculated based on the energy usage transacted between the energy supplier and energy consumer multiplied by our contractual commission rate 
revenue from commissions is recognized as earned over the life of each contract as energy is consumed  provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  has been successfully demonstrated 
we 
table of contents generally recognize revenue on these transactions when we have received verification from the electricity supplier of the end users power usage and electricity supplier s subsequent collection of the fees billed to the end user 
the verification is generally accompanied with payment of the agreed upon fee to us  at which time the revenue is recognized 
commissions paid in advance are recorded as customer advances and are recognized monthly as commission revenue based on the energy exchanged that month 
to the extent we do not receive verification of actual energy usage or we cannot reliably estimate what actual energy usage was for a given period  revenue is deferred until usage and collection data is received from the energy supplier 
in october  we acquired nep 
nep recognizes revenue monthly as energy flows from the energy supplier to the end user 
we can reliably estimate actual energy usage based on historical usage data compiled by nep 
demand response transactions demand response transaction fees are recognized when we receive confirmation from the csp that the energy consumer has performed under the applicable rto or iso program requirements 
the energy consumer is either called to perform during an actual curtailment event or is required to demonstrate its ability to perform in a test event during the performance period 
for pjm the performance period is june through september in a calendar year 
test results are submitted to pjm by the csps and we receive confirmation of the energy consumer s performance in the fourth quarter 
csps typically pay us ratably on a quarterly basis throughout the demand response fiscal june to may year 
as a result  a portion of the revenue we recognize is reflected as unbilled accounts receivable 
wholesale and environmental commodity transactions wholesale transaction fees are invoiced upon the conclusion of the auction based on a fixed fee 
these revenues are not tied to future energy usage and are recognized upon the completion of the online auction 
for reverse auctions where our customers bid for a consumer s business  the fees are paid by the bidder 
for forward auctions where a lister is selling energy products  the fees are typically paid by the lister 
while substantially all wholesale transactions are accounted for in this fashion  a small percentage of our wholesale revenue is accounted for as electricity or gas is delivered  similar to the retail electricity transaction methodology described above 
environmental commodity transaction fees are accounted for utilizing two primary methods 
for regulated allowance programs like rggi  fees are paid by the lister and are recognized as revenue quarterly as auctions are completed and approved 
for most other environmental commodity transactions both the lister and the bidder pay the transaction fee and revenue is recognized upon the consummation of the underlying transaction as credits are delivered by the lister and payment is made by the bidder 
channel partner commissions we pay commissions to our channel partners at contractual rates based on monthly energy transactions between energy suppliers and energy consumers 
the commission is accrued monthly and charged to sales and marketing expense as revenue is recognized 
we pay commissions to our salespeople at contractual commission rates based upon cash collections from our customers 
revenue estimation our estimates in relation to revenue recognition affect revenue and sales and marketing expense as reflected on our statements of operations  and trade accounts receivable and accrued commission accounts as reflected on our balance sheets 
for any quarterly reporting period  we may not have actual usage data for certain energy suppliers and will need to estimate revenue 
we initially record revenue based on the energy consumers historical usage profile 
at the end of each reporting period  we adjust this historical profile to reflect actual usage for the period and estimate usage where actual usage is not available 
for the year ended december   we estimated usage for approximately of our revenue resulting in a negative  or approximately  adjustment to decrease revenue 
this decrease in revenue resulted in an approximate  decrease in sales and marketing expense related to third party commission expense associated with those revenues 
corresponding adjustments were made to trade accounts receivable and accrued commissions  respectively 
a difference between this estimate and actual usage would have an approximate  effect on our revenue for the year ended december  energy efficiency services our energy efficiency services segment is primarily project driven where we identify efficiency measures that energy consumers can implement to reduce their energy usage 
we present retrofit opportunities to customers  get approval from them to proceed and submit the proposal to the local utility for cost reimbursement 
once the utility approves funding for the project  we install the equipment  typically new heating  ventilation or air conditioning equipment  or replace lighting fixtures to more efficient models 
we recognize revenue for energy efficiency services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
due to the short term nature of projects typically two to three weeks  we utilize the completed contract method 
we also assess multiple contracts entered into by the same customer in close proximity to determine if the contracts should be combined for revenue recognition purposes 
revenues are recognized based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts on a specifically identified basis  as well as through historical experience applied to an aging of accounts  if necessary 
trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
to date write offs have not been material 
goodwill indefinite lived assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value and fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
indefinite lived intangibles are intangible assets whose useful lives are indefinite in that their lives extend beyond the foreseeable horizon that is there is no foreseeable limit on the period of time over which they are expected to contribute to the cash flows of the reporting entity 
we account for these items in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb  under which goodwill and intangible assets having indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate possible impairment 
we perform our annual impairment test at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year  or earlier  if indicators of potential impairment exist 
this impairment test is performed for each of our segments energy brokerage and energy efficiency services which have been determined to be our reporting units 
the impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is a three step process 
step gives entities the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to test for impairment on a reporting unit by reporting unit basis 
if after performing the qualitative assessment  an entity concludes that it is more likely than not mltn  typically quantified as a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the entity would perform a two step impairment test 
however  if  after applying the qualitative assessment  the entity concludes that it is not mltn that the fair value is less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test is not required 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit whereby the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
to determine the fair value of each of the reporting units as a whole  we use a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed by management 
the discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate  applicable for each reporting unit 
in assessing the reasonableness of the determined fair values of the reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 
we performed a step one analysis on both the energy brokerage and energy efficiency services reporting units and determined that the indicated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values 
we rely on a weighted average cost of capital of for each reporting unit which takes into consideration certain specific small company premiums 
we utilized a long term growth rate of approximately and for the energy brokerage and efficiency services reporting units  respectively  and assumed a tax rate of for both units 
we performed a qualitative assessment of its indefinite lived intangible assets related to our energy efficiency segment and determined it was not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
intangible assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our intangible assets 
the criteria used for these assumptions include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization expense are based on an estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in the company s reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends and significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives 
intangible assets consist of customer relationships and contracts  purchased technology and other intangibles  and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to ten years 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets in accordance with guidance from the fasb  we periodically review long lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted 
table of contents undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to the carrying amount 
no impairment of our long lived assets was recorded as no change in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of the assets was not recoverable during fair value measurements we follow asc fair value measurements and disclosures asc for fair value measurements 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard provides a consistent definition of fair value  which focuses on an exit price  which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the standard also prioritizes  within the measurement of fair value  the use of market based information over entity specific information and establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the hierarchy established under asc gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
level pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date 
as required by asc  the company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments  even in situations where the company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price 
level pricing inputs are quoted prices for similar investments  or inputs that are observable  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term through corroboration with observable market data 
level includes investments valued at quoted prices adjusted for legal or contractual restrictions specific to these investments 
level pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment  that is  inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level includes investments that are supported by little or no market activity 
income taxes in accordance with guidance from the fasb  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined at the end of each period based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss carryforwards  as well as differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred income tax expense or credits are based on changes in the asset or liability from period to period 
valuation allowances are provided if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider past performance  expected future taxable income  and qualitative factors which we consider to be appropriate in estimating future taxable income 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is for future periods that can be reasonably estimated 
results that differ materially from current expectations may cause us to change our judgment on future taxable income and adjust our existing tax valuation allowance 
we have reviewed the tax positions taken  or to be taken  in our tax returns for all tax years currently open to examination by the taxing authority in accordance with the fasb s recognition and measurement standards 
at december   there are no expected material  aggregate tax effects of differences between tax return positions and the benefits recognized in our financial statements 
we account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes 
stock based compensation we recognize the compensation cost from stock based awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
for the year ended december   share based awards consisted of grants of stock options  restricted stock and stock warrants and for the years ended december  and  share based awards consisted of grants of stock options and stock warrants 
the vesting period of stock based awards is determined by the board of directors  and is generally four years for employees 
we account for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
for the years ended december   and stock based awards to non employees consisted of grants of stock warrants 
the vesting period of stock warrants granted ranged from one to five years 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
the new guidance is intended to reduce the complexity and costs of the annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets by allowing companies to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of impairment to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test 

table of contents this new guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this standard in for our assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
the update requires companies to disclose information about financial instruments that have been offset and related arrangements to enable users of their financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on their financial position 
companies will be required to provide both net offset amounts and gross information in the notes to the financial statements for relevant assets and liabilities that are offset 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after january  we do not expect the application of this update to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our revenue is subject to seasonality and fluctuations during the year primarily as a result of weather conditions and its impact on the demand for energy 
the majority of our revenue is generated from the commissions we receive under any given energy contract  which is tied to the energy consumer s consumption of energy 
therefore  revenue from natural gas consumption tends to be strongest during the winter months due to the increase in heating usage  and revenue from electricity consumption tends to be strongest during the summer months due to the increase in air conditioning usage 
our revenue is also subject to fluctuations within any given season  depending on the severity of weather conditions during a particularly cold winter or an unseasonably warm summer  energy consumption will rise 
in addition  transaction revenue in the natural gas and wholesale markets for which we invoice upon completion of the respective transaction tends to be higher in the first and fourth quarters when utilities and natural gas customers make their annual natural gas buys 
cyclicality we believe that our business will continue to be cyclical in nature and is tied  in part  to market energy prices which impact transaction volume 
when energy prices increase in competitive markets above the price levels of the regulated utilities  energy consumers are less likely to lock in to higher fixed price contracts in the competitive markets and so they are less likely to use our auction platform 
conversely  when energy prices decrease in competitive markets below the price levels of the regulated utilities  energy consumers are more likely to lock in to lower fixed price contracts in the competitive markets and they are more likely to use our auction platform 
although our short term revenue is impacted by usage trends  these cyclical effects will also have longer term implications on our business because we derive future revenue from current auctions 
our energy efficiency services segment tends to experience higher revenue in the third and fourth quarters as utilities approve funding for projects to be completed by the end of their calendar year 
off balance sheet transactions we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
impact of inflation and changing prices historically  our business has not been materially impacted by inflation 
we provide our service at the inception of the service contract between the energy supplier and energy consumer 
our fee is set as a fixed dollar amount per unit of measure and fluctuates with changes in energy demand over the contract period 
foreign currency fluctuation our commission revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars 
therefore  we are not directly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations on our current orders 
however  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates do have an effect on energy consumers access to us dollars and on pricing competition 
we have entered into non us dollar contracts but they have not had a material impact on our operations 
we do not believe that foreign exchange fluctuations will materially affect our results of operations
