item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to strengthen the company 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operating segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our credit facility and contractual commitments 
we also provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during the year  if any  as well as those not yet adopted that may have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
we have three reportable operating segments commercial trailer products  diversified products and retail 
the commercial trailer products segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail segment 
the diversified products segment focuses on our commitment to expand our customer base  diversify our product offerings and revenues and extend our market leadership by leveraging our proprietary duraplate panel technology  drawing on our core manufacturing expertise and making available products that are complementary to the truck and tank trailers and transportation equipment we offer 
the retail segment includes the sale of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through our retail branch network 
executive summary as the calendar year concluded  evidence suggested that we had reached the beginning of a recovery within the trailer industry as demand increased significantly from the historical lows of and we began with a focused commitment to profitable growth and margin improvement 
with the improved demand environment for trailers throughout  as evidenced by our  new trailer shipments during the current year period  our healthy backlog of million as of december   as well as a strong demand forecast by industry forecasters  we were successfully able to deliver margin improvement through improved product pricing and to recapture lost margins experienced during the previous downturn 
more specifically  according to most recent act estimates  total new trailer shipments in totaled approximately  trailers representing an increase of as compared to the prior year  and representing the second consecutive year that total trailer demand exceeded normal replacement demand levels estimated to be between  trailers and  trailers 
in addition to our commitment to profitably grow our commercial trailer products segment  our strategic initiatives included a focus on diversification efforts  both organic and strategic  through our diversified products segment to enhance our business model  strengthen our revenues and become a stronger company delivering greater value to our shareholders 
organically  our focus on profitably growing and diversifying by leveraging our existing assets  capabilities and technology  with our key focus being to successfully apply our industry leading and revolutionary duraplate composite panel technology into higher margin products and markets 
strategically  our focus was on profitably growing and diversifying the products we offer  as well as the customers and end markets we serve and strengthening our geographic presence 
as a result of this strategic initiative  in may we successfully completed the acquisition of walker group holdings walker  a leading manufacturer of liquid transportation systems and engineered products 
our diversified products segment has now grown to represent approximately of our consolidated revenues and approximately of our gross profits for the current year period  significantly increasing this segment s impact to our bottom line 
in connection with the completion of the walker acquisition  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due notes and completed a million term loan credit agreement 
in addition  we entered into an amendment to our existing credit agreement that effectively 
table of contents reduced our borrowing capacity from million to million  subject to a borrowing base  and extended the maturity by an additional year to may these new and amended debt facilities provided us the option to increase the total borrowing facility up to an additional million  subject to certain conditions 
as a result of our debt recapitalization efforts  a continued improvement in the trailer market and our ability to generate significant cash flows from operations during the current year period  we were able to make significant improvements to our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity 
as of december   our liquidity position totaled million  an increase of approximately million  or  from the previous year 
the outlook for the overall trailer market for continues to indicate a strong demand environment 
in fact  the most recent estimates from industry forecasters  act and ftr associates ftr  indicate demand levels to be in excess of the estimated replacement demand levels in each of the years through more specifically  act is currently estimating demand will grow by an additional to approximately  with through industry demand levels ranging between  and  trailers  while ftr anticipates a decline in trailer demand for to approximately  trailers 
this continued strong demand environment reinforces our belief that we are still in the early stages of a recovery in the trailer industry  and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected strong overall demand levels while also achieving continued margin growth through improvements in product pricing as well as operational excellence initiatives 
however  we are not relying solely on volume and product pricing within the trailer industry to improve operations and enhance profitability 
as noted above  through our diversified products segment  we remain committed to enhancing and diversifying our business model through the organic and strategic initiatives discussed previously 
through this operating segment we can offer a wide array of products and customer specific solutions beyond those offered in our commercial trailer products segment that we believe provide a good foundation for achieving these goals 
continuing to identify the appropriate opportunities to leverage our proprietary technology and core manufacturing expertise into new applications and end markets enables us to deliver greater value to our customers and shareholders 
operating performance we measure our operating performance in six key areas safety  quality  delivery  cost reduction  morale and environment 
we maintain a continuous improvement mindset in each of these key performance areas 
our objective of being better today than yesterday and better tomorrow than we are today is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety morale 
we continually focus on reducing the severity and frequency of workplace injuries in order to minimize our workers compensation costs and to create a safe environment for all associates 
we believe that our improved environmental  health and safety management translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time away from work and improved system management 
quality 
we monitor product quality on a continual basis through a number of means for both internal and external performance as follows internal performance 
our primary internal quality measurement is process yield 
process yield is a performance metric that measures the impact of all aspects of the business on our ability to ship our products at the end of the production process 
as with previous years  the expectations of the highest quality product continue to increase while maintaining process yield performance and reducing rework 
in addition  we currently maintain an iso registration of our quality management system at our lafayette operations 
external performance 
we actively track our warranty claims and costs to identify and drive improvement opportunities in quality and reliability 
early life cycle warranty claims for our van trailers are trended for performance monitoring 
early life cycle warranty claims per trailers produced averaged approximately  and claims per trailers in  and  respectively  but with the implementation of significant continuous improvement initiatives during the first half of  the claim rate dropped to approximately claims per trailers by the end of 
table of contents delivery productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line cycle time speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements over the last several years in these areas have translated into significant improvements in our ability to better manage inventory flow and control costs 
during the past several years  we focused on productivity enhancements within manufacturing assembly and sub assembly areas through developing the capability for mixed model production 
we also established a central warehousing and distribution center to improve material flow  inventory levels and inventory accuracy within our supply chain 
the successful implementation of these productivity enhancements supported our ability to effectively manage the recent increases in trailer volumes as well as efficiently produce a wide range of products on fewer assembly lines 
cost reduction 
we believe continuous improvement is a fundamental component of our operational excellence focus 
our continued focus on the wabash integrated network win program has allowed us to improve all areas of manufacturing including safety  quality  inventory management  maintenance and cost reduction 
utilizing these systems has enabled us to realize total cost per unit reductions by increased capacity utilization of all facilities while maintaining a lower level of fixed overhead 
within recent years  we realized cost reductions as a result of closing production facilities in mt 
sterling  kentucky and anna  illinois while maintaining our production capacity 
we also have a tank trailer manufacturing facility in queretaro  mexico that provides a low cost advantage for that product line  and in we expanded the paint capacity at our platform manufacturing facility in cadiz  kentucky  to allow for increased steel capacity and decreased per unit operating costs 
environment 
we maintain an iso registration of our environmental management system at our lafayette operations 
in  we installed a fifty five foot wind turbine to help generate power for part of our trailer manufacturing facilities in lafayette which will help reduce carbon emissions by approximately twenty five tons annually 
in addition  we have restored natural habitats near our lafayette operations to enhance the environment and protect wildlife 
industry trends truck transportation in the us  according to the ata  was estimated to be a billion industry in ata estimates that approximately of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment 
trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported 
to monitor the state of the industry  we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry 
recent trends we have observed include the following transportation trailer cycle 
transportation in the us  including trucking  is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles over the last years 
the most recently completed cycle began in early when industry shipments totaled approximately  reached a peak in with shipments of approximately  and reached the bottom in with shipments of approximately  trailers 
in each of these three us economic downturns  the decline in freight tonnage preceded the general economic decline by approximately two and one half years and its recovery has generally preceded that of the economy as a whole 
the trailer industry generally follows the transportation industry cycles 
after three consecutive years with total trailer demand well below normal replacement demand levels estimated to be between  trailers and  trailers  and were years of significant improvement in which the total trailer market increased year over year approximately and  respectively  with total shipments of approximately  and  respectively 
as we enter the early stages of an economic recovery  act is estimating demand within the trailer industry to increase in and to approximately  and  trailers  respectively  with forecasted demand to remain above  trailers through furthermore  the increase in demand for trailers in and is being driven by improvements within the dry van segment  our largest product line 
act is forecasting the total dry van market to grow from approximately  trailers in to approximately  and  trailers in and  respectively  representing year over year increases of and  respectively 
our view is generally consistent with that of act 

table of contents age of trailer fleets 
the average age of fleets has remained at historical highs over the past several years as fleets deferred on their capital investments during the most recent industry downturn 
according to act  the average age of dry and refrigerated vans in were approximately years and years  respectively  as compared to years and years  respectively  in the increase in age of trailers suggests an increase in replacement demand over the next several years 
new trailer orders 
according to act  total orders in were approximately  trailers  a slight increase from approximately  trailers ordered in total orders for the dry van segment  the largest within the trailer industry  were approximately  which were in line with dry vans ordered in transportation regulations and legislation 
there are several different topics within both federal and state government regulations and legislation that are expected to have an impact on trailer demand  including the federal motor carrier safety administration the fmcsa has recently taken steps to improve the overall truck safety standards  particularly by implementing compliance  safety  and accountability csa program 
csa is considered a comprehensive driver and fleet rating system that measures both the freight carriers and drivers on several safety related criteria  including driver safety  equipment maintenance and overall condition of trailers 
this system drives increased awareness and action by carriers since enforcement actions were targeted and implemented beginning in june csa is generally believed to have contributed to the tightening of the supply of drivers and capacity in and as carriers took measures to improve their rating 
the fmcsa issued a final rule in december on its revised proposal for rule changes in regard to truck driver hours of service rules 
the new proposed rule changes include reductions in total driver hours from hours per week to hours and retains the per day limit of hours 
the rule  which is scheduled to go into effect in july  also requires alterations to the required rest period that drivers must follow 
though this proposal has been met with strong opposition  particularly by the ata  current estimates indicate these actions could lead to productivity losses of approximately 
we believe this ruling will increase the general need for equipment and increases the potential that a carrier s drop and hook activities will increase and  therefore  will require a higher ratio of trailer to trucks across the industry 
the fmcsa also issued in january a proposed rule change requiring the installation and use of electronic on board recorders for over the road trucks and buses that would be used to monitor and enforce the driver hours of service rules 
the proposed rule was rejected by the us circuit court of appeals in september and the fmcsa is working on a revised rule to meet the october deadline 
the agency indicated in october it will release a new proposal for the mandate by march the tax relief act of extended bonus depreciation provisions for  and more specifically  corporations can expense of certain capital investments made during this extension will be an incentive for many fleets to increase or accelerate their purchase decisions to maximize the tax benefits available 
the california air resource board carb regulations mandate that refrigeration units older than years may no longer operate in california 
as refrigeration units become obsolete  capacity in the refrigerated segment will tighten and the increase in demand for new refrigerated trailers is likely 
carb regulations also mandate fuel efficiency improvements on all fleets operating in california for which our duraplate aeroskirt provides a durable  aerodynamic side panel solution that yields the improved fuel efficiencies required by these regulations 
other developments 
other developments and potential impacts on the industry include while we believe the need for trailer equipment will be positively impacted by the legislative 
table of contents and regulatory changes addressed above  these demand drivers could be offset by factors that contribute to the increased concentration and density of loads  including the miniaturization of electronic products and packaging optimization of bulk goods 
increases in load concentration or density could contribute to decreased need or demand for dry van trailers 
trucking company profitability  which can be influenced by factors such as fuel prices  freight tonnage volumes  and government regulations  is highly correlated with the overall economy of the us carrier profitability significantly impacts demand for  and the financial ability to purchase  new trailers 
although truck driver shortages have not been a significant problem in the past year  constraints are expected to exacerbate as fleet equipment utilization increases due to new government regulations 
as a result  trucking companies are under increased pressure to look for alternative ways to move freight  leading to more intermodal freight movement 
we believe that railroads are at or near capacity  which will limit their ability to respond to freight demand pressures 
therefore  we expect that the majority of freight will continue to be moved by truck and  according to ata  overall truck activity as a percentage of the total freight industry is expected to increase throughout the next decade

we used the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the notes to fund a portion of the purchase price of the walker acquisition 
we account separately for the liability and equity components of the notes in accordance with authoritative guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
the guidance requires the carrying amount of the liability component to be estimated by measuring the fair value

we determined that senior  unsecured corporate bonds traded on the market represent a similar liability to the convertible senior notes without the conversion option 
based on market data available for publicly traded  senior  unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry and with similar maturity  we estimated the implied interest rate of the notes to be  assuming no conversion option 
assumptions used in the estimate represent what market participants would use in pricing the liability component  including market interest rates  credit standing  and yield curves  all of which are defined as level observable inputs 
the estimated implied interest rate was applied to the notes  which resulted in a fair value of the liability component of million upon issuance  calculated as the present value of implied future payments based on the million aggregate principal amount 
the million difference between the cash proceeds before offering expenses of million and the estimated fair value of the liability component was recorded in additional paid in capital 
the discount on the liability portion of the notes will be amortized

the net proceeds received were used to fund the purchase price of the walker acquisition completed in the second quarter as well as related fees and expenses incurred as part of this transaction 

table of contents as of december   our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity  amounted to million  representing an increase of million from december  total debt and capital lease obligations amounted to million as of december  as we continue to see improvements in the overall trailer industry  as well as our operating performance metrics  we believe our liquidity is adequate to fund operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures for capital expenditures capital spending amounted to approximately million for and is anticipated to be approximately million for capital spending for was primarily utilized to support growth and improvement initiatives within our facilities  including an investment of approximately million to expand our paint capabilities at our cadiz  kentucky facility where we manufacture our platform trailers 
off balance sheet transactions as of december   we had approximately million in operating lease commitments of which million relate to commitments assumed from the walker acquisition 
we did not enter into any material off balance sheet debt or operating lease transactions during the year 
outlook the demand environment for trailers remained healthy throughout  as evidenced by our new trailer shipments during the current year period  a strong backlog  a trailer forecast by industry forecasters above replacement demand levels for the next several years and our ability to increase prices to recover material cost increases and improve margins 
recent estimates from industry forecasters  act and ftr  continue to provide further support for strong demand levels in and beyond as act is currently estimating demand to be approximately  trailers for  representing an increase of as compared to  and forecasting continued strong demand levels into the foreseeable future with estimated annual average demand for the four year period ending of approximately  new trailers 
furthermore  ftr anticipates new trailer demand to be approximately  new trailers in  representing a decrease of as compared to while projecting a stronger new trailer demand in totaling  trailers 
while there are downside concerns relating to issues with the global economy  unemployment  and housing and construction related markets in the us  taking into consideration these industry forecasts  discussions with both our customers and suppliers as well as the need to renew an excessively aged trailer fleet  management expects demand for new trailers to continue to remain strong as we move into other challenges we face as we proceed into will primarily relate to managing raw material commodity and component costs 
while most commodity costs have recently stabilized  raw material costs remain volatile 
as has been our policy  we will endeavor to pass along raw material and component price increases to our customers in addition to continuing our hedging activities in an effort to minimize the risk of changes in commodity prices having a significant impact on our operating results 
we believe we are well positioned for long term growth in the trailer industry because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate and other industry leading brand trailers continue to have increased market acceptance  our focus is on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailer maintenance and operating costs providing the best overall value  and our continued expansion of our presence through our company owned branch locations and independent dealer network 
based on these industry demand forecasts  conversations with our customers regarding their current requirements  our existing backlog of orders and our continued efforts to be selective in our order acceptance to ensure we obtain appropriate value for our products  we estimate that for the full year total new trailers sold  including from walker  will be between  and  which reflects volumes equal to or slightly stronger than demand levels 
as a result of our commitment to recapture margins within our commercial trailer products segment  our expectation for growth in trailer volumes is below the expected industry growth rate 
however  we have already begun to realize the improvements in pricing and gross margins and we expect continued improvements as we progress into in addition  if the trailer market expands further as currently forecasted by act  we may have the ability to exceed these estimated levels in 
table of contents we are not relying solely on volume and price recovery within the trailer industry to improve operations and enhance our profitability 
executing our strategic initiative to become a diversified industrial manufacturer will provide us the opportunity to address new markets  enhance our financial profile and reduce the cyclicality within our business 
the diversified products segment has continued to gain momentum and generate increased revenues and earnings 
while demand for some of these products is dependent on the development of new products  customer acceptance of our product solutions and the general expansion of our customer base and distribution channels  we anticipate the long term growth rate of demand for these products to exceed that of our commercial trailer products 
the walker acquisition completed in may  as well as our purchase of certain assets of beall corporation completed in february  further diversifies our business  complements our leadership position in trailer manufacturing and related products and technologies and potentially provides for additional growth and value creation as we actively pursue margin enhancing synergies 
in addition  we have been and will continue to focus on developing innovative new products that both add value to our customers operations and allow us to continue to differentiate our products from the competition 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of payments of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  both on and off balance sheet  as of december  are as follows in millions

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate or changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

balance sheet caption critical estimate item nature of estimates required assumptions approaches used key factors additional paid in capital stock based compensation we are required to estimate the fair value of all stock awards we grant 
we use a binomial valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock awards 
we feel the binomial model provides the most accurate estimate of fair value 
risk free interest rate historical volatility dividend yield expected term in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair market value of new and used trailers is subject to variation  particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our new and used inventories at december   would be approximately million 
other inflation we have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a significant impact on our business 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is more than its carrying amount 
if based on its qualitative assessment an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying amount  quantitative impairment testing is not required 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  quantitative impairment testing is required 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs asu 
asu is intended to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments are of two types i those that clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and ii those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended asu  comprehensive income  presentation of comprehensive income  which will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the guidance in asu does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured  or when it must be reclassified to net income 
the guidance in asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   and should be applied retrospectively 
the company adopted this standard using two consecutive statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu 
table of contents asu defers the requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of aoci in both net income and oci on the face of the financial statements 
the effective dates for asu are consistent with the effective dates for asu and  similar to the company s adoption of asu  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which will require entities to provide information about amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income by component 
we are required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  the amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income to the respective line items in the consolidated statements of operations 
this amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we have exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks we are exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  nickel  wood and polyethylene 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
historically  we have managed aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers 
as of december   we had million in raw material purchase commitments through december for materials that will be used in the production process 
we typically do not set prices for our products more than days in advance of our commodity purchases and can  subject to competitive market conditions  take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding under our revolving facility 
however  during we maintained an average floating rate borrowing level of million under our revolving line of credit 
in addition  as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under our term loan credit agreement totaling million that bear interest at a floating rate  subject to a minimum interest rate 
based on the average borrowings under our revolving facility and the outstanding indebtedness under our term loan credit agreement  a hypothetical basis point change in the floating interest rate would result in a corresponding million change in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
c 
foreign exchange rates we are subject to fluctuations in the british pound sterling and mexican peso exchange rates that impact transactions with our foreign subsidiaries  as well as us denominated transactions between these foreign subsidiaries and unrelated parties 
a five percent change in the british pound sterling or mexican peso exchange rates would have an immaterial impact on results of operations 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
