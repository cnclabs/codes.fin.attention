the sellers may also be paid contingent consideration ranging from zero to cad million if the canadian business meets certain earnings targets for the period beginning july  and ending on june  sellers may receive a portion of the contingent consideration of up to cad million if interim earnings targets are met through june and june  respectively 
any such payments are not recoverable in the event of any failure to meet overall targets

the salvage value of this facility is estimated to be million 
on october   we announced our plans to consolidate the retail and financial operations currently managed in our shelton  connecticut facility with our atlanta  georgia based operations

the total remaining capacity under this authorization was approximately million as of december  this authorization has no expire date 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the fiscal years ended december  and december  pursuant to any repurchase authorization other than the shares of common stock from the company s employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock to such employees

in addition to the total contractual obligations and commitments in the table above  we have post retirement benefit obligations and contingent consideration liabilities  which are included in other current and other long term liabilities  as further described in our notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
liquidity outlook based on our current outlook  we believe that cash generated from operations and available cash  together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility  will be adequate to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
effects of inflation and deflation in recent years  we have experienced increased costs of cotton  labor  fuel  and transportation  and have also had higher costs for foreign sourced products as a result of the devaluation of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies 
although we expect product costs to decline in fiscal compared to fiscal  we expect product costs will generally remain above historic levels 
while we raised our selling prices on many of our products over the past two years  we have been unable to fully absorb the cost increases and our profitability has been adversely impacted 
in recent years  we experienced deflationary pressure on its selling prices  in part driven by intense price competition in the young children apparel industry 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability due to the timing of certain holidays and key retail shopping periods  generally resulting in lower sales and gross profit in the first half of our fiscal year 
more of our consolidated net sales over the past five fiscal years  excluding the effect of the acquisition in fiscal  have typically been generated in the second half of our fiscal year approximately 
accordingly  our results of operations during the first half of the year may not be indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those policies that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize wholesale and ecommerce revenue after shipment of products to customers  when title passes  when all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in certain cases  in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
in the normal course of business  we grant certain accommodations and allowances to our wholesale customers to assist these customers with inventory clearance or promotions 
such amounts are reflected as a reduction of net sales and are recorded based upon agreements with customers  historical trends  and annual forecasts 
retail store revenues are recognized at the point of sale 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns and deductions 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments and other actual and estimated deductions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectability 
our credit and collections department reviews all other balances regularly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we record cooperative advertising arrangements with major wholesale customers at fair value 
such fair value is determined based upon  among other factors  comparable market analysis for similar advertisements 
we have included the fair value of these arrangements of approximately million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively  as a component of selling  general  and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations rather than as a reduction of revenue 
amounts determined to be in excess of the fair value of these arrangements are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
inventory we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  additional write downs may be required 
goodwill and tradename as of december   we had approximately million in carter s and bonnie togs goodwill and million of aggregate value related to the carter s  oshkosh  and bonnie togs tradename assets 
the fair value of the carter s and oshkosh tradenames were valued at the time of the applicable acquisition using discounted cash flow analysis in  in the case of carter s  and  in the case of oshkosh 
the carter s and oshkosh tradenames were determined to have indefinite lives 
the bonnie togs tradename was valued at the date of the acquisition in  also using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the bonnie togs tradename was determined to have a definite life and is being amortized over two years 
the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinite lived tradename assets are subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year 
impairment reviews may also be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances affecting our business 
factors affecting such impairment reviews include the continued market acceptance of our offered products and the development of new products 
we use discounted cash flow models for quantitative assessments to determine item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the fair value of these assets  using assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount equal to that excess 
for indefinite lived intangibles  we may utilize a qualitative assessment  as described below  to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite lived asset is less than its carrying value 
we perform impairment tests of goodwill at the reporting unit level 
we may utilize a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if so  it is determined that the two step goodwill impairment test using quantitative assessments is required to be performed 
if not  no further testing is required and the relevant qualitative factors supporting the strength in fair value are documented 
qualitative factors may include  but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events 
under the quantitative assessment  the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit 
the assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analysis  including  but not limited to  the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates 
additionally  we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analysis are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
as a result  the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analysis may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends  regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed 
therefore  we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets even though realized actual cash flows are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecast amounts 
based upon our most recent assessment  performed as of december   there was no impairment in the value of goodwill or indefinite lived tradename assets 
accrued expenses accrued expenses for workers compensation  incentive compensation  health insurance  k  and other outstanding obligations are assessed based on actual commitments  statistical trends  and estimates based on projections and current expectations  and these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
loss contingencies we record accruals for various contingencies including legal exposures as they arise in the normal course of business 
we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible  or probable 
our assessment is developed in consultation with our internal and external counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation  which  by its nature is unpredictable 
we believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal  and foreign 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting dates 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon the examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
for those income item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are also recognized 
we also assess permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property  plant  and equipment  stock based compensation expense  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency the functional currency of substantially all of our foreign operations is the local currency 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
employee benefit plans we sponsor a defined contribution k plan  a frozen defined benefit pension plan and other unfunded post retirement plans 
the defined benefit pension and post retirement plans require an actuarial valuation to determine plan obligations  and related periodic costs 
plan valuations require economic assumptions  including expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates to value plan obligations and employee demographic assumptions including mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are reflected as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses that exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligations or market value of assets are amortized to earnings over the estimated service life of the remaining plan participants 
any future obligation under our pension plan not funded from investment returns on plan assets will be funded from cash flows from operations 
the most significant assumption used to determine the company projected benefit obligation under its defined benefit plans is the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation 
a change in the assumed discount rate would result in an increase or decrease in the amount of the pension plan projected benefit obligation of approximately million 
see the employee benefit plans footnote to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further details on rates and assumptions 
stock based compensation arrangements we account for the cost resulting from stock based compensation arrangements at grant date fair value  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the following volatility this is a measure of the amount by which a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate 
we use actual monthly historical changes in the market value of our stock covering the expected life of stock options being valued 
an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense 
risk free interest rate this is the us treasury rate as of the grant date having a term equal to the expected term of the stock option 
an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
expected term this is the period of time over which the stock options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience and estimated future exercise behavior 
separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
an increase in the expected term will increase compensation expense 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dividend yield we do not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense 
forfeitures we estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we account for performance based awards over the vesting term of the awards that are expected to vest based on whether it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved 
we reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period for awards with performance criteria and adjusts stock based compensation expense based on its probability assessment 
forward looking statements statements contained herein that relate to our future performance  including  without limitation  statements with respect to our anticipated results of operations or level of business for fiscal or any other future period  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on current expectations only and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated  or projected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency and interest rate risks in the operation of our business  we have market risk exposures including those related to foreign currency risk and interest rates 
these risks and our strategies to manage our exposure to them are discussed below 
we contract for production with third parties primarily in asia 
while these contracts are stated in united states dollars  there can be no assurance that the cost for the future production of our products will not be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and the local currencies of these contractors 
due to the number of currencies involved  we cannot quantify the potential impact of future currency fluctuations on net income loss in future years 
to date  such exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
transactions by our canadian subsidiary may be denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency  which is the canadian dollar 
fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar  may affect our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
we employ foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the procurement of us dollar denominated finished goods destined for the canadian market 
these foreign exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  which could result in earnings volatility 
as of december   there are no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our revolving credit facility  which carries variable interest rates 
as of december   our outstanding variable rate debt aggregated approximately million 
weighted average borrowings for fiscal were million 
an increase or decrease of in the effective interest rate would have increased or decreased our fiscal interest cost by approximately million 
other risks we enter into various purchase order commitments with our suppliers 
we can cancel these arrangements  although in some instances  we may be subject to a termination charge reflecting a percentage of work performed prior to cancellation
