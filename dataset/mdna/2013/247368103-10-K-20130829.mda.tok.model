item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook we had a good year across our business units  with the exception of soffe 
we have been busy working on a number of initiatives that should have a very positive effect on our results as we go forward 
soffe difficulties primarily stem from a high degree of turmoil that occurred in the mid tier retail industry and our failure to make adjustments in our go to market strategy and operations in a timely manner to address changes in fashion and the market direction 
our management team continues to focus its attention to address the problems experienced at soffe and to take steps to regain the sales and profitability we have historically enjoyed with the business 
during the year  we realigned our merchandising  marketing and sales leadership  who are focused on expanding the retail customer base and replacing the business we lost 
we are excited about the new soffe product line designed for spring we have shown the line to focus groups and key retailer accounts and have received very positive responses 
we have modernized soffe screen print operations and on july  announced the closing of the wendell  north carolina decoration facility to consolidate these operations into the fayetteville facility 
this will improve soffe printing capabilities and should save approximately million annually beginning in september we are in the process of implementing improved systems and business processes to streamline our operations so they run more efficiently 
although it will take some time before we see the full benefits of these changes in our results  we should begin seeing improved operating margins as the fiscal year progresses 
we also took steps to reduce our selling  general and administrative headcounts at soffe and continue to work on additional measures to lower these costs 
our other business units performed well during the year  growing sales and expanding margins from improved manufacturing performance and successful merchandising initiatives 
we began the consolidation of our bookstore business into the game 
we recently introduced a new collegiate apparel line under the game  american threads  a made in the usa collection 
the line just hit stores  but appears to be well received by college students 
we are also getting interest from other customers regarding the made in the usa apparel and headwear products  creating another potential growth avenue for delta apparel 

table of contents the junkfood business continued its growth in as well 
we continue to build the junk food brand with direct to consumer business  and will continue this in fiscal year with the opening of a junk food flagship retail store on abbot kinney boulevard in venice  california 
the store will embrace the full lifestyle approach and  in addition our junkfood graphic products and our new stray heart product line of contemporary non graphic women apparel  will offer contemporary brands in other product categories so the customer can purchase all the essentials for a complete outfit at our junk food store 
in conjunction with the new retail store  junkfood is also re launching its ecommerce site to take advantage of new technology 
the new site will feature a wider array of products  both junkfood and stray heart  along with web exclusive opportunities 
in addition  the site will have enhanced functionality with ease of navigation for an ultimate junkfood experience 
during fiscal year in our basics segment  we completed the conversion of funtees to the catalog erp platform  allowing us to streamline operations  consolidate administrative functions  and reduce general and administrative costs 
with this we are able to provide broader offerings to our customers using off the shelf blanks combined with our decoration and retail packaging services 
this has allowed us to gain market share with retail licensing customers  who previously had to dual source products 
we anticipate the convenience and wider range of offerings will continue to gain traction with customers  driving continued growth in the basics segment 
during the year we also completed the move of our print development offshore and have doubled the size of our el salvador screen printing operations 
the resources that we have invested in printing provide us with new technologies and printing techniques that should enable us to satisfy the growing demand for decoration services 
our manufacturing expansion project is also currently underway 
we are expanding textile operations at our ceiba textile plant in honduras  as well as expanding sewing operations in that country 
as output from these facilities is increased  it will leverage our fixed costs driving lower product costs and improved margins 
in january  we opened a third party operated distribution center in canada to support the growing customer base in that country 
we are taking a further step to broaden our footprint with a distribution center in dallas  texas 
the dallas distribution facility will be third party operated  minimizing the need for capital investment on our part 
serving key markets throughout texas and surrounding states  it will enable us to offer one day shipping to customers as well as serving as a customer pick up point in that location 
in addition to better serving our existing customer base and providing a platform to attract new customers  the new distribution center should also lower our overall freight cost to customers in the southwest 
we expect to begin shipping from the facility by december and be fully functional for the spring selling season 
on august  we completed the acquisition of the assets of salt life holdings  llc  including all domestic and international trademark rights to the salt life brand 
we are excited to add this fast growing lifestyle brand to our portfolio of brands 
the purchase price consisted of million of cash  two promissory notes in the aggregate amount of million  and a contingent payment if certain performance targets are met with respect to sales levels in calendar we financed the cash portion of the purchase price through an amendment to our us asset based secured revolving credit facility 
having worked with salt life under a license agreement for the past two years  we have grown the geographic distribution of the brand from a single market in florida  to more than  retail doors from texas up the coast to the northeast 
the acquisition of salt life continues our strategy of building lifestyle brands that take advantage of our creative capabilities  vertical manufacturing platform and international sourcing competencies 
we are excited about the opportunities we have as owners of the salt life brand 
we plan to greatly increase the investment in consumer advertising and point of sale branding to further build core consumer appeal for each of the groups of salt life enthusiasts surfers  divers  fishermen and beach goers  and the millions of other consumers who long to live the salt life 
while this acquisition will have minimal impact on our revenue and earnings in the upcoming year  we expect it to be a key growth catalyst in the future 
we look forward to the many opportunities we will build upon for strong continued growth with the salt life brand 
we have also decided to change our fiscal year end from june to september 
this move will better align our planning  financial and reporting functions with the seasonality of the business and should provide investors with more timely information that better reflects the operations of the business 
from now on  our fiscal year will end on the saturday closest to september we will have a three month bridge period ending on september  our fiscal will then begin on september  and end on september  earnings guidance for the three month bridge period ending september   we expect sales in the range of million to million 
we are expecting continued sales growth in each of our business units except soffe  which is expected to have continued softness through the fall 
earnings are expected to be to per share in this three month period 
this includes approximately per share of one time costs  comprising related to the wendell closing and related to the salt life acquisition 
for the new fiscal year ending september   we anticipate revenue to be in the to million range and earnings to come in at to per diluted share 

table of contents our fiscal year guidance is based on the following assumptions organic sales growth in each of our business units 
the sales growth is expected to come from higher volumes  which in some cases will be offsetting lower average selling prices 
cotton remains at the current prices in the mid cent range with basic tee prices remain level 
while cotton prices have moderated considerably from the volatility experienced in the past two years  speculators in the market and potential changes in china cotton policy continue to make cotton prices quite volatile 
selling  general and administration costs to decrease as a percentage of sales by up to basis points even with increased marketing in our brands  especially salt life  in the upcoming year 
gross margins continue to improve in the to basis points range driven by improved manufacturing costs as we gain efficiencies and further leverage the fixed expenses with our planned manufacturing expansion 
the improved gross margins would be recognized in the second half of the fiscal year 
increased interest expense based on the higher debt levels from the salt life acquisition  including the non cash interest expense recorded on the zero interest promissory notes 
an effective tax rate between and 
results of operations overview fiscal year marked another year of growth for delta apparel  inc and our tenth consecutive year of record revenue 
strong net sales growth in our basics segment along with junkfood  the game and art gun drove the record revenue 
these gains were offset by softness in the soffe business that continued through the fiscal year 
gross margins in the basics segment improved  basis points in fiscal year as we benefited from manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings initiatives 
in addition  the prior year had been impacted by the effects resulting from the high cotton costs 
gross margins also expanded in each of the branded business units  besides soffe  from effective merchandising strategies 
operating profit increased to million  or of sales  resulting in net earnings of million  or  per diluted share compared to an operating loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year quarterly financial data for information regarding quarterly financial data  refer to note quarterly financial information unaudited to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
fiscal year versus fiscal year net sales for fiscal year were million  a million  or  increase from the prior year sales of million  all of which was organic sales growth 
the basics segment increase in unit sales was partially offset by lower average selling prices  resulting in sales growth  bringing sales to million 
sales in the branded segment declined to million 
junk food apparel and the salt life collection  along with art gun  had strong sales growth  which was offset by lower sales of soffe merchandise 
gross margins increased basis points to of net sales in fiscal year from of net sales in the prior year 
the prior year gross margins were negatively impacted by the effect that high cotton prices were having on our industry 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude them from gross profit and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily from an increase in performance based compensation expense resulting from the improvement in earnings during fiscal year compared to the prior year 
in addition  fiscal year included million of cost associated with previously disclosed internal investigation by the audit committee related to fiscal year fiscal year operating income was million  or of sales  compared to a million operating loss  or of sales  in fiscal year resulting from the factors described above 
operating income of million in the basics segment was partially offset by a million loss in the branded segment  resulting from softness in the soffe business 

table of contents net interest expense for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  from million for fiscal year our fiscal year effective income tax rate was compared to an effective tax rate of which resulted in a tax benefit in fiscal year we benefit from having income in foreign jurisdictions that are either exempt from income taxes or have tax rates lower than the united states 
the tax benefit in fiscal year was impacted by the operating losses driven by the inventory markdown during the year which lowered our us taxable income while maintaining profits in the offshore taxable and tax free jurisdictions 
fiscal year had a net earnings of million  a million increase from the net loss of million in fiscal year fiscal year versus fiscal year net sales for fiscal year were million  a million  or  increase from the prior year sales of million  all of which was organic sales growth 
both the basics and branded segments contributed to the increase  with an increase in our basics segment and a increase in our branded segment 
sales in the branded segment were million  or approximately of total sales 
junk food apparel and the growth of the salt life collection contributed to the increased sales  which was partially offset by lower sales of soffe merchandise 
sales within the basics segment increased to million  or of our total revenue 
the organic growth in the basics segment was driven by a increase in average selling prices  partially offset by a decline in units sold 
gross margins declined basis points to of net sales in fiscal year from of net sales in the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was driven primarily from the impact of higher raw material prices in both the branded and basics segment 
the decrease in margins for the year was accelerated in the second fiscal quarter when we took a million inventory markdown in the basics segment  an action taken to account for the negative effect that cotton prices were having on our industry 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude them from gross profit and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily from a decrease in performance based compensation expense resulting from the decline in earnings during fiscal year compared to the prior year 
in addition  fiscal year included costs associated with the acquisition of the cotton exchange  as well as some brand marketing campaigns that were not repeated in fiscal year fiscal year resulted in an operating loss of million  or of sales  in fiscal year  compared to an operating profit of million  or of sales  in fiscal year resulting from the factors described above 
operating income in the branded segment was million  while the basics segment generated a loss of million 
net interest expense for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal year the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher debt levels resulting from the additional working capital requirements from the higher raw material costs 
in addition  average interest rates rose approximately basis points  further increasing interest expense in fiscal year our fiscal year effective income tax rate was compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal year the tax rate was impacted by the operating losses driven by the inventory markdown during the year  lowering our us taxable income while maintaining profits in the offshore taxable and tax free jurisdictions fiscal year had a net loss of million  a million decrease from net earnings of million in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources credit facility and other financial obligations on may   delta apparel  soffe successor by merger to tcx  llc  junkfood  to the game and art gun entered into a fourth amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended loan agreement with the financial institutions named in the amended loan agreement as lenders  wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent  bank of america  na  as syndication agent  wells fargo capital finance  llc  as sole lead arranger  and wells fargo capital finance  llc and merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated  as joint bookrunners 
pursuant to the amended loan agreement  the line of credit is million subject to borrowing base limitations  and matures on may  provided that no event of default exists  we have the option to increase the maximum credit available under the facility to million subject to borrowing base limitations  conditioned upon the agent ability to secure additional commitments and customary closing conditions 
at june   we had million outstanding under our us revolving credit facility at an average interest rate of  and had the ability to borrow an additional million 
for further information regarding our us asset based secured credit facility  refer to note long term debt and note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents in the third quarter of fiscal year  we renegotiated our loan agreement with banco ficohsa  a honduran bank 
proceeds from the new loan agreement were used to extinguish the existing loan indebtedness and resulted in no gain or loss being recorded upon extinguishment 
as of june   we had a total of million outstanding on this loan 
for further information regarding our honduran credit facility  refer to note long term debt to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
our primary cash needs are for working capital and capital expenditures  as well as to fund share repurchases under our stock repurchase program 
in addition  in the future we may use cash to pay dividends 
derivative instruments from time to time we may use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rates 
these financial instruments are not used for trading or speculation purposes 
when we enter into a derivative instrument  we determine whether hedge accounting can be applied 
where hedge accounting can be applied  a hedge relationship is designated as either a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
the hedge is documented at inception  detailing the particular risk objective and strategy considered for undertaking the hedge 
the documentation identifies the specific asset or liability being hedged  the risk being hedged  the type of derivative used and how effectiveness of the hedge will be assessed 
on september   we entered into three interest rate swap agreements  as follows effective date notational amount libor rate maturity date interest rate swap million interest rate swap million interest rate swap million we assessed these agreements and concluded that the swap agreements match the exact terms of the underlying debt except for a slight timing difference 
we use a hypothetical derivative method to assess and measure ineffectiveness associated with the hedge each reporting period 
during fiscal years and  the interest rate swap agreements had minimal ineffectiveness and were considered highly effective hedges 
changes in the derivatives fair values are deferred and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of income taxes  until the underlying transaction is recorded 
when the hedged item affects income  gains or losses are reclassified from aoci to the consolidated statements of operations as interest income expense 
any ineffectiveness in our hedging relationships is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of operations 
the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements resulted in an aoci gain  net of taxes  of thousand for the year ended june  and an aoci loss  net of taxes  of million the year ended june  operating cash flows in fiscal year  operating activities provided million in cash compared to million in cash used by operating activities for fiscal year the improvement in operating cash flow during fiscal year from the prior year resulted from stronger operating earnings  lower inventory costs  the tax refund received from the carryback of the net operating loss  and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the cash flow used by operating activities in fiscal year resulted from our net loss combined with lower accounts payable  taxes payable and accrued expenses 
investing cash flows cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year in fiscal year  we used million in cash for the purchase of property and equipment primarily to improve our information technology in both our branded and basics segments  to increase our post production decorating and warehouse capacity  and to lower costs in our manufacturing facilities  which support both our branded and basics segments 
in fiscal year  we used million for the purchase of property and equipment primarily to improve our manufacturing platform and business operating systems 
we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal year  most of which will focus on expansion in both our international and us manufacturing and decoration facilities and improvements to our business operating systems 
financing activities cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year in fiscal year  we used cash to reduce our outstanding debt and for the purchase of our common stock 
in fiscal year  the cash was primarily provided from our us revolving credit facility and used for working capital  for capital expenditures and for the purchase of our common stock 

table of contents future liquidity and capital resources based on our expectations  we believe that our credit facility should be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable working capital needs  and that the cash flow generated by our operations and funds available under our credit line should be sufficient to service our debt payment requirements  to satisfy our day to day working capital needs and to fund our planned capital expenditures 
any material deterioration in our results of operations  however  may result in our losing the ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and to issue letters of credit to suppliers  or may cause the borrowing availability under our facility to be insufficient for our needs 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations  as of june   by future period 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt a operating leases capital leases letters of credit minimum royalty payments purchase obligations total b a we exclude interest payments from these amounts because the cash outlay for the interest is unknown and cannot be reliably estimated because the majority of the debt is under a revolving credit facility 
interest payments will be determined based upon the daily outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility and the prevailing interest rate during that time 
b we excluded deferred income tax liabilities of million from the contractual cash obligations table because we believe inclusion would not be meaningful 
refer to note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our deferred income tax liabilities 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods and therefore would not relate to liquidity needs 
as a result  including deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period in the schedule could be misleading 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as defined by item a of regulation s k promulgated by the sec other than the letters of credit  operating leases  and purchase obligations described above 
we have entered into derivative interest rate contracts as described and included below in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report 
dividends and purchases of our own shares we are allowed to make cash dividends and stock repurchases if i as of the date of the payment or repurchase and after giving effect to the payment or repurchase  we have availability on that date of not less than million and average availability for the day period immediately preceding that date of not less than million  and ii the aggregate amount of dividends and stock repurchases after may  does not exceed million plus of our cumulative net income as defined in the amended loan agreement from the first day of fiscal year to the date of determination 
at june  and july   there was million and million  respectively  of retained earnings free of restrictions to make cash dividends or stock repurchases 
our board of directors did not declare  nor were any dividends paid  during fiscal years and we would expect that our board of directors would consider the advisability of instituting a dividend program in the future 
any future cash dividend payments will depend upon our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements  compliance with loan covenants and other relevant factors 
as of june   our board of directors had authorized management to use up to million to repurchase stock in open market transactions under our stock repurchase program 
on january   the board of directors authorized an additional million for share repurchases  bringing the aggregate total authorized to million 
during fiscal years  and  we purchased  shares   shares and  shares  respectively  of our common stock for a total cost of million  million and million  respectively 
as of june   we have purchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate of million since the inception of the stock repurchase program 
all purchases were made at the discretion of management and pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of sec rule b as of june   million remained available for future purchases under our stock repurchase program  which does not have an expiration date 

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our most critical accounting estimates  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves  inventory and related reserves  the carrying value of goodwill  and the accounting for income taxes 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized when ownership is transfered to the customer  which includes not only the passage of title  but also the transfer of the risk of loss related to the product 
at this point  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and we are reasonably assured of the collectibility of the sale 
the majority of our sales are shipped fob shipping point and revenue is therefore recognized when the goods are shipped to the customer 
for sales that are shipped fob destination point  we do not recognize the revenue until the goods are received by the customer 
shipping and handling charges billed to our customers are included in net revenue and the related costs are included in cost of goods sold 
revenues are reported on net sales basis  which is computed by deducting product returns  discounts and estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis by considering historical and current trends 
royalty revenue is primarily derived from royalties paid to us by licensees of our intellectual property rights  which include  among other things  trademarks and copyrights 
we execute license agreements with our licensees detailing the terms of the licensing arrangement 
royalties are generally recognized upon receipt of the licensees royalty report  in accordance with the terms of the executed license agreement  and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
accounts receivable and related reserves in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers based upon defined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  as shown on our consolidated balance sheets  are net of related reserves 
we estimate the net collectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment 
in situations where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  reserves are determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
in addition  reserves are established for other concessions that have been extended to customers  including advertising  markdowns and other accommodations  net of historical recoveries 
these reserves are determined based upon historical deduction trends and evaluation of current market conditions 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness or further weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
inventories and related reserves we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
inventory cost includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead on manufactured inventory  and all direct and associated costs  including inbound freight  to acquire sourced products 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record reserves for obsolescence  excess quantities  irregulars and slow moving inventory based on historical selling prices  current market conditions  and forecasted product demand to reduce inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual selling prices are less favorable than those projected  or if sell through of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory reserves may be required 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million lower of cost or market write down on the inventory in the basics segment and its firm purchase commitments for yarn resulting from historically high cotton prices in its inventory costs combined with declining selling prices 
the estimation of the total write down involved management judgments and assumptions including assumptions regarding future selling price forecasts  the allocation of raw materials between business units  the estimated costs to complete  disposal costs and a normal profit margin 
the inventory and yarn firm purchase commitments associated with this inventory write down was sold during our fiscal year 
table of contents goodwill and contingent consideration goodwill and definite lived intangibles were recorded in conjunction with our acquisitions of junkfood clothing company and art gun 
we did not record any separately identifiable indefinite lived intangibles associated with either of these acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired  and is required to be written down when impaired 
the goodwill impairment testing process involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to a variety of factors  including sales  gross margins  selling  general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures  cash flows and the selection of an appropriate discount rate  all of which are subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
when we perform goodwill impairment testing  our assumptions are based on annual business plans and other forecasted results  which we believe represent those of a market participant 
we select a discount rate  which is used to reflect market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows  based on the best information available as of the date of the impairment assessment 
in our second quarter of fiscal year  we identified indicators of impairment on the art gun goodwill 
the test of impairment indicated that the goodwill at art gun was fully impaired  resulting in a million impairment charge recorded in the fiscal quarter ended january  see note m significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our remeasurement of contingent consideration and testing for goodwill impairment  which information is herein incorporated by reference 
given the current macro economic environment and the uncertainties regarding its potential impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions used in our impairment tests will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved  it is possible that an impairment review may be triggered and goodwill may be determined to be impaired 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in fiscal year  we generated federal net operating losses of million 
this net operating loss was classified in income tax receivable at june  when we filed our fiscal year end tax return  we carried back the net operating loss against the taxable income from fiscal years and the remaining million of operating loss is classified in the income tax receivable at june  as it will be applied against our fiscal year taxable income 
we established a valuation allowance related to certain of our state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb codification no 
 income taxes asc 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective state tax jurisdictions 
we had state net operating loss carryforwards nols in fiscal years and of approximately million and million  respectively 
we had deferred tax assets of million for both fiscal years and related to these state nols  with related valuation allowances against them of approximately million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
these net loss carryforwards expire at various intervals through recent accounting standards for information regarding recently issued accounting standards  refer to note z and note aa to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity we have a supply agreement with parkdale to supply our yarn requirements until december  under the supply agreement  we purchase from parkdale all of our yarn requirements for use in our manufacturing operations  excluding yarns that parkdale does not manufacture or cannot manufacture due to temporary capacity constraints 
the purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost 
thus  we are subject to the commodity risk of cotton prices and cotton price movements  which could result in unfavorable yarn pricing for us 
we fix the cotton prices as a component of the purchase price of yarn  pursuant to the supply agreement  in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from parkdale 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time we elect to fix specific cotton prices 
yarn with respect to which we have fixed cotton prices at june  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and september at june   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the yarn 
this compares to what would have been a negative impact of million at the fiscal year end based on the yarn with fixed cotton prices at june  the impact of a decline 
table of contents in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have been less at june  than at june  due to lower cotton commitments at june  compared to june  we may use derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in commodity prices 
we do not designate our options as hedge instruments upon inception 
accordingly  we mark to market changes in the fair market value of the options in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operation 
we did not own any significant cotton options contracts on june  or june  if parkdale s operations are disrupted and it is not able to provide us with our yarn requirements  we may need to obtain yarn from alternative sources 
although alternative sources are presently available  we may not be able to enter into short term arrangements with substitute suppliers on terms as favorable as our current terms with parkdale 
in addition  the cotton futures we have fixed with parkdale may not be transferable to alternative yarn suppliers 
because there can be no assurance that we would be able to pass along the higher cost of yarn to our customers  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity our us revolving credit facility provides that the outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding floating rate indebtedness at june  under the us revolving credit facility had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness was increased by basis points  our expense would have increased by approximately million  or  for the fiscal year 
this compares to an increase of million  or  for the fiscal year based on the outstanding floating rate indebtedness at june  the effect of a basis point increase in interest rates would have had a lower dollar impact for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  due to the lower debt levels outstanding on june  the percentage increase is less significant for fiscal year than for fiscal year because our total interest expense for fiscal year was lower than our total interest expense for fiscal year the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding 
derivatives from time to time  we may use interest rate swaps or other instruments to manage our interest rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes 
see note y and note d to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our derivatives
