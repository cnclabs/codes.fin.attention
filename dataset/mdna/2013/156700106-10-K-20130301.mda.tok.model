see special note regarding forward looking statements in item of this report for factors relating to these statements and risk factors in item a of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services to our residential  business  governmental and wholesale customers 
our communications services include local and long distance  network access  private line including special access  public access  broadband  data  managed hosting including cloud hosting  colocation  wireless and video services 
in certain local and regional markets  we also provide local access and fiber transport services to competitive local exchange carriers and security monitoring 
we strive to maintain our customer relationships by  among other things  bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services 
at december   we operated approximately million access lines in states  served approximately million broadband subscribers  and operated data centers throughout north america  europe and asia 
during  we updated our methodology for counting broadband subscribers to include residential  business and wholesale subscribers instead of only residential and small business subscribers 
we have restated our previously reported amounts to reflect this change 
for purposes of counting our access lines  we include only those access lines that we use to provide services to external customers and exclude lines used solely by us and our affiliates 
our counting methodology also excludes unbundled loops and includes stand alone broadband subscribers 
our methodology for counting access lines may not be comparable to those of other companies 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of centurylink  inc centurylink and its majority owned subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries include savvis  inc savvis as of july  and qwest communications international inc qwest as of april  see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
due to the significant size of these acquisitions  direct comparisons of our results of operations for the years ended december   and to prior periods are less meaningful than usual 
we discuss below  under results of operations segment results  certain trends that we believe are significant  even if they are not necessarily material to the combined company 
in the discussion that follows  we refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the savvis acquisition and the qwest acquisition as legacy savvis and legacy qwest  respectively 
references to legacy centurylink  when used in reference to a comparison of our consolidated results for the years ended december  and  mean the business we operated prior to the qwest and savvis acquisitions 
due to the magnitude of our recent acquisitions in relation to legacy centurylink operations  in the combined company variance discussions below we have separately reflected the impacts of both the legacy qwest and legacy savvis operations for enhanced visibility  although we actively manage the combined company through our four segments  as discussed further below 
we have incurred operating expenses related to our acquisitions of savvis in july  qwest in april and embarq in july these expenses are reflected in cost of services and products and 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations as summarized below 
years ended december  dollars in millions cost of services and products integration and other expenses associated with acquisitions severance expenses  accelerated recognition of share based awards and retention compensation associated with acquisitions total selling  general and administrative expenses incurred to effect acquisitions integration and other expenses associated with acquisitions severance expenses  accelerated recognition of share based awards and retention compensation associated with acquisitions total this table does not include costs incurred by qwest or savvis prior to being acquired by us 
based on current plans and information  we estimate  in relation to our qwest acquisition  total integration  severance and retention expenses to be between million to million which includes approximately million of cumulative expenses incurred through december  and our capital expenditures associated with integration activities will approximate million which includes approximately million of cumulative capital expenditures incurred through december  
we anticipate that the amount of our integration costs in future years will vary substantially based on integration activities conducted during those periods and could in certain cases be significantly higher than those incurred by us during the year ended december  for several years prior to  we reported our operations as a single segment 
however  in  in connection with our acquisitions of qwest on april  and savvis on july   we reorganized our business into the following operating segments regional markets 
consisted primarily of providing products and services to residential consumers  small to medium sized businesses and regional enterprise customers  business markets 
consisted primarily of providing products and services to enterprise and government customers  wholesale markets 
consisted primarily of providing products and services to other communications providers  and savvis operations 
consisted primarily of providing hosting and network services primarily to business customers provided by legacy savvis 

table of contents in the second quarter of  in order to more effectively deploy the strategic assets acquired from qwest and savvis and to better serve our business and government customers  we restructured our business into the following operating segments regional markets 
consists primarily of providing strategic and legacy products and services to residential consumers  state and local governments  small to medium sized businesses and enterprise customers that in each case are located mainly within one of our six regions 
our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our private line  broadband  mpls  hosting  video services  and wireless services 
our legacy services offered to these customers consist primarily of local and long distance service  wholesale markets 
consists primarily of providing strategic and legacy products and services to other domestic and international communications providers 
our strategic products and services offered to these customers are mainly private line including special access and mpls 
our legacy services offered to these customers include unes which allow our wholesale customers the use of our network or a combination of our network and their own networks to provide voice and data services to their customers  long distance and switched access services  enterprise markets network 
consists primarily of providing strategic and legacy network communications products and services to national and international enterprise and government customers 
our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our private line  broadband  mpls and hosting services 
our legacy services offered to these customers consist primarily of local and long distance services  and enterprise markets data hosting 
consists primarily of providing colocation  managed hosting and cloud hosting services to national and international enterprise and government customers 
due to system limitations  we have determined that it is impracticable to report segment information using our segment structure described above 
as such  only financial data has been revised under our segment structure described above 
we now report financial information separately for each of these segments  however  our segment information does not include capital expenditures  total assets  or certain revenues and expenses that we manage on a centralized basis and are only reviewed by our chief operating decision maker codm on a consolidated basis 
our segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that our segments would have achieved had they operated as stand alone entities during the periods presented 
for additional information about our segments  see note segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report and results of operations segment results below 
on january   we announced a reorganization of our operating segments 
consequently  beginning with the first quarter of  we will report the following four segments in our consolidated financial statements consumer  business  wholesale and data hosting 
the primary purpose of the reorganization is to strengthen our focus on the enterprise business market while continuing our commitment to our hosting and consumer customers 
the reorganization combines business sales and operations functions that resided in the enterprise markets network segment and the regional markets segment into the new business segment 
the remaining customers serviced by the regional markets segment will become the new consumer segment 
our wholesale markets and enterprises markets data hosting segments will not be impacted by the organizational realignment 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations for the years ended december   and our operating results include operations of savvis for periods after july  and qwest for periods after april  years ended december  dollars in millions except per share amounts operating revenues operating expenses operating income other income expense income tax expense net income basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share due to our acquisitions of qwest on april  and savvis on july   our operating results reflect a full year of qwest and savvis results  as compared to our operating results  which reflect only nine months of qwest operating results and five and a half months of savvis operating results 
the increase in net income in was primarily due to the period containing a full year of qwest operating results compared to the period only containing nine months and a significant decrease from in the amount of acquisition  severance and integration expenses resulting from our recent acquisitions  as presented in the table under the overview section above 
the lower levels of net income in as compared to were primarily due to increased acquisition  severance and integration expenses attributable to the april  acquisition of qwest 
the post acquisition operations of legacy savvis and legacy qwest  which included substantial severance and integration expenses and significant acquisition accounting adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense based on valuation estimates  did not contribute significantly to our consolidated net income in see note acquisitions and note goodwill  customer relationships and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
within our legacy centurylink business  growth in strategic services revenues which we describe further below did not fully offset lower revenues from other services and products  further contributing to decreases in consolidated net income 
diluted earnings per common share in was higher than as a result of increased net income for diluted earnings per common share in was substantially lower than the amounts for the corresponding period of due to decreases in net income  as well as increases in the weighted average number of outstanding common shares 
the increase in the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during and was primarily attributable to the issuance of approximately million shares in connection with the qwest acquisition on april  and the issuance of approximately million shares in connection with the savvis acquisition on july  
table of contents the following table summarizes our broadband subscribers  access lines and number of employees as of december  in thousands operational metrics broadband subscribers access lines employees during the second quarter of  we updated our methodology for counting broadband subscribers to include residential  business and wholesale subscribers instead of only residential and small business subscribers 
we have restated our previously reported amounts to reflect this change 
during the last several years  we have experienced revenue declines primarily due to declines in access lines  intrastate access rates and minutes of use 
prior to our acquisition  qwest had experienced similar declines in its revenues 
to mitigate these declines  we remain focused on efforts to  among other things promote long term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services  provide new services  such as video  cloud hosting  managed hosting  colocation and other additional services that may become available in the future due to  among other things  advances in technology or improvements in our infrastructure  provide our broadband and premium services to a higher percentage of our customers  pursue acquisitions of additional assets if available at attractive prices  increase usage of our networks  and market our products and services to new customers 
operating revenues we currently categorize our products  services and revenues among the following four categories strategic services  which include primarily broadband  private line including special access which we market to wholesale and business customers who require dedicated equipment to transmit large amounts of data between sites  mpls which is a data networking technology that can deliver the quality of service required to support real time voice and video  hosting including cloud hosting and managed hosting  colocation  ethernet  video including resold satellite and our facilities based video services  voip and verizon wireless services  legacy services  which include primarily local  long distance  switched access  public access  isdn which uses regular telephone lines to support voice  video and data applications  and wan services which allows a local communications network to link to networks in remote locations  data integration  which includes the sale of telecommunications equipment to customers for use on their premises and related professional services  such as network management  installation and maintenance of data equipment and building of proprietary fiber optic networks for our government and business customers  and other revenues  which consists primarily of usf revenue and surcharges 
unlike the first three revenue categories  other revenues are not included in our segment revenues 

table of contents the following table summarizes our operating revenues under our current revenue categorization which is presented in a manner that we believe will be useful for understanding the relevant trends affecting our business years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions strategic services legacy services data integration other total operating revenues during  operating revenues attributable to certain products and services were reclassified from legacy services to strategic services 
due to system limitations  we have determined that is impracticable to restate s operating revenues to conform to our current revenue categorization 
for comparability purposes  we have included our operating revenues for the years ended december  and under our prior revenue categorization years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions strategic services legacy services data integration other total operating revenues our operating revenues increased substantially in both and as compared to and  respectively  due to our acquisitions of qwest on april  and savvis on july  total operating revenues increased billion in as compared to and increased billion in as compared to as reflected in the chart above  our acquisitions of qwest and savvis contributed incremental operating revenues net of intercompany eliminations of billion and million  respectively  to our revenues 
legacy centurylink operating revenues decreased million  or  in and million  or  in as compared to the prior year period 
these decreases were primarily attributable to declines in legacy services revenues  which reflected the continuing loss of access lines in our markets 
at december   we had million access lines  of which million were in legacy qwest markets 
access lines in our legacy centurylink markets declined to million at december  from million at december   a decrease of during  and were million at december   a decrease of during we believe the decline in the number of access lines was primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services 
we estimate that our access lines loss will be between and in our legacy services revenues were also negatively impacted in by the continued reduction in access revenues and continued migration of customers to bundled service offerings at lower effective rates 
the decreases in our legacy services revenues were partially offset by higher revenues from strategic services revenues 
ethernet  
table of contents mpls  internet protocol television iptv  voip and broadband services accounted for a majority of the growth in strategic services revenues 
we are aggressively marketing our strategic services including our data hosting services and data integration to offset the continuing declines in our legacy services revenues 
we believe our recent acquisitions of savvis and qwest will strengthen our ability to achieve this goal 
further analysis of our operating revenues by segment is provided below in segment results 
operating expenses our current definitions of operating expenses are as follows cost of services and products exclusive of depreciation and amortization are expenses incurred in providing products and services to our customers 
these expenses include employee related expenses directly attributable to operating and maintaining our network such as salaries  wages  benefits and professional fees  facilities expenses which include third party telecommunications expenses we incur for using other carriers networks to provide services to our customers  rents and utilities expenses  equipment sales expenses such as data integration and modem expenses  costs for universal service funds usf which are federal and state funds that are established to promote the availability of telecommunications services to all consumers at reasonable and affordable rates  among other things  and to which we are often required to contribute  and other expenses directly related to our network and hosting operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses are corporate overhead and other operating expenses 
these expenses include employee related expenses such as salaries  wages  internal commissions  benefits and professional fees directly attributable to selling products or services and employee related expenses for administrative functions  marketing and advertising  taxes such as property and other taxes and fees  external commissions  bad debt expense  and other selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expense classifications may not be comparable to those of other companies 
during and  our operating expenses increased substantially in comparison to and primarily due to our acquisitions of qwest and savvis 
the following tables summarize our operating expenses years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions cost of services and products exclusive of depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses 
table of contents years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions cost of services and products exclusive of depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses the acquisitions of qwest and savvis largely contributed to the increase in total operating expenses of billion in excluding the effects of legacy qwest and legacy savvis expenses  total operating expenses in decreased million  or  due primarily to decreases in employee related expenses  severance and integration expenses relating to our recent acquisitions and depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in total operating expenses of billion in was largely attributable to the inclusion of billion in post acquisition legacy qwest operating expenses net of intercompany eliminations in our consolidated operating expenses 
in addition  the acquisition of savvis on july  increased our consolidated operating expenses for by million 
as discussed in the overview section  our operating expenses for   and included substantial severance and integration costs related to the qwest  savvis and embarq acquisitions as well as significant acquisition accounting adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense 
see note acquisitions and note goodwill  customer relationships and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
excluding the effects of legacy qwest and legacy savvis expenses  total operating expenses in increased million  or  due primarily to integration costs associated with the qwest acquisition and increased costs of providing our facilities based video services to more customers 
for the year ended december   legacy centurylink cost of services and products exclusive of depreciation and amortization were slightly lower as compared to during the year  we experienced decreases in severance  salaries and wages and related benefits  which were partially offset by increases in customer premise equipment and maintenance costs  network expense  and contractor costs 
cost of services and products for legacy centurylink operations was relatively unchanged in for  million of higher costs of services and products associated with providing our facilities based video service were substantially offset by a million decrease in salaries and benefits and a million decrease in facilities costs associated with the migration of legacy embarq long distance traffic to our internal networks 
legacy centurylink selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for as compared to  while selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for as compared to the decrease in primarily was due to a decrease in severance and integration expenses relating to our recent acquisitions  as well as a decrease in salaries  wages  and employee benefits due to a reduction in headcount 
for all periods presented  our expenses include significant transaction  severance and integration expenses related to the qwest  savvis and embarq acquisitions see table in overview above 
changes in the timing and amount of qwest and savvis integration expenses resulted in a net increase in legacy centurylink selling  general and administrative expenses compared to this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in in operating taxes  which were primarily due to favorable property tax and transaction tax settlements 
in addition  in we had a decrease of million in compensation expenses  which were primarily due to workforce reductions and lower pension expense 

table of contents effective january   we changed our rates of capitalized labor as we transitioned certain of qwest legacy systems to our historical company systems 
this transition resulted in an estimated million to million increase in the amount of labor capitalized as an asset compared to the amount that would have been capitalized if qwest had continued to use its legacy systems and a corresponding estimated million to million decrease in operating expenses for the year ended december  the reduction in expenses described above  net of tax  increased net income approximately million to million  or to per basic and diluted common share  for the year ended december  excluding the effects of the acquisitions of qwest and savvis  depreciation and amortization expense for legacy centurylink decreased million  or  due to annual updates of our depreciation rates for capitalized assets and an out of period accounting adjustment  partially offset by net growth in capital assets 
depreciation and amortization for legacy centurylink increased million  or  in primarily due to higher levels of property  plant and equipment and an out of period accounting adjustment corrected in further analysis of our operating expenses by segment is provided below in segment results 
other consolidated results the following tables summarize our total other income expense and income tax expense years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions interest expense net loss on early retirement of debt other income expense total other income expense income tax expense nm nm nm years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions interest expense net loss on early retirement of debt other income expense total other income expense income tax expense nm nm nm nm attributing changes in income tax expense to the acquisitions of savvis and qwest is considered not meaningful 

table of contents interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million compared to this increase is primarily due to the period containing a full year of qwest interest expense compared to the period containing only nine months 
interest expense increased million in primarily due to higher debt balances associated principally with debt assumed in the qwest acquisition and incurred to finance the savvis acquisition 
see note long term debt and credit facilities to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report and liquidity and capital resources below for additional information about those transactions 
interest expense for legacy centurylink increased million  or  in compared to and increased million  or  in compared to the increase in both years is substantially due to interest on our billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in june to finance the savvis acquisition 
the increase is due to those notes being outstanding for a full year versus a partial year in the increase was due to those notes being outstanding for a partial year versus not at all in net loss on early retirement of debt in the fourth quarter of  qcii redeemed certain of its outstanding debt securities  which resulted in a gain of million 
in the second quarter of  our subsidiaries embarq and qc completed premium priced cash tender offers for the purchase of certain of their respective outstanding debt securities  resulting in an aggregate loss of million 
also in the second quarter of  our subsidiaries embarq and qcii redeemed certain of their respective outstanding debt securities which resulted in a net loss of million 
during  qcii and qc redeemed certain of their outstanding debt securities  which resulted in a gain of million 
in the fourth quarter and second quarter of  qc redeemed certain of its outstanding debt securities which resulted in a total net loss of million 
other income expense other income expense reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations  including our share of income from our interest in a cellular partnership  interest income  gains and losses from non operating asset dispositions and impairments and foreign currency gains and losses 
other income for legacy centurylink was greater for the year ended december  as compared to due to gains on the sales of our auction rate securities and the recognition in of million in transaction expenses incurred in connection with terminating an unused bridge loan financing commitment related to the savvis acquisition 
see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other income for legacy centurylink decreased million in  as compared to primarily due to the million in transaction expenses discussed above 
income tax expense our income tax expense for the years ended december  and increased million and decreased million  respectively  from the amounts for the comparable prior year 
our increase in was primarily due to a million  or  increase in income before income tax expense as compared to our decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in income before income tax expense  which was attributable to a decline in operating income and increased interest expense directly related to the acquisition of qwest 
for the years ended december   and  our effective income tax rate was  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate reflects the million reversal of a valuation allowance related to the auction rate securities we sold in  
table of contents a million benefit related to state nols net of valuation allowance  and a million expense associated with reversing a receivable related to periods that have been effectively settled with the irs 
the rate increase was due in part to million of non deductible transaction costs and an million valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets that require future income of a special character to realize the benefits 
such increase was partially offset by a million reduction in our valuation allowance related to state nols due primarily to the effects of a tax law change in one of the states in which we operate 
certain merger related costs incurred during are also non deductible for income tax purposes and similarly increased our effective income tax rate 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report and income taxes below for additional information 
segment results as described further above under the heading management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  we revised our segment structure in and restated previously reported segment results for the year ended december  to conform to our segment presentation 
the following table summarizes our segment results for and under our segment categorization at december  years ended december  dollars in millions total segment revenues total segment expenses total segment income total margin percentage regional markets revenues expenses income margin percentage wholesale markets revenues expenses income margin percentage enterprise markets network revenues expenses income margin percentage enterprise markets data hosting revenues expenses income margin percentage 
table of contents due to system limitations  we have determined that it is impracticable to restate s reported segments to conform to our current segment categorization at december  for comparability purposes  we have included our segment information for the years ended december  and based on the segment categorization we were operating under at the end of years ended december  dollars in millions total segment revenues total segment expenses total segment income total margin percentage regional markets revenues expenses income margin percentage business markets revenues expenses income margin percentage wholesale markets revenues expenses income margin percentage savvis operations revenues expenses income margin percentage the lower levels of margin percentage for regional markets and business markets in were primarily attributable to the inclusion of qwest results beginning april  
table of contents the following table reconciles our total segment revenues and total segment income presented above to operating revenues and operating income reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  dollars in millions total segment revenues other operating revenues operating revenues reported in our consolidated statements of operations total segment income other operating revenues depreciation and amortization other unassigned operating expenses operating income reported in our consolidated statement of operations our segment revenues include all revenues from our strategic and legacy services and data integration as described in more detail above 
segment revenues are based upon each customer classification to an individual segment 
we report our segment revenues based upon all services provided to that segment customers 
we report our segment expenses for our four segments as follows direct expenses  which primarily are specific expenses incurred as a direct result of providing services and products to segment customers  along with selling  general and administrative expenses that are directly associated with specific segment customers or activities  and allocated expenses  which include network expenses  facilities expenses and other expenses such as fleet and real estate expenses 
during the first quarter of  as we transitioned certain of qwest legacy systems to our historical company systems  we updated our methodologies for reporting our direct expenses and for allocating our expenses to our segments 
specifically  we no longer include certain fleet expenses for our regional markets segment in direct expenses  they are now expenses allocated to our segments  with the exception of enterprise markets data hosting 
in addition  we now more fully allocate network building rent and power expenses to our regional markets  wholesale markets and enterprise markets network segments 
we determined that it was impracticable to recast our segment results for prior periods to reflect these changes in methodology 
during the second quarter of  as we reorganized our business into our four segments as indicated above  we further revised our methodology for how we allocate our expenses to our segments to better align segment expenses with related revenues 
under our revised methodology  we no longer allocate certain product development costs to our segments  but we do now allocate certain expenses from our enterprise markets data hosting segment to our other three segments 
we restated our segment results for to reflect these changes in our methodology 
we determined that it was impracticable to recast our segment results for under our revised methodology 
we do not assign depreciation and amortization expense to our segments  as the related assets and capital expenditures are centrally managed 
similarly  severance expenses  restructuring expenses and  subject to an exception for our enterprise markets data hosting segment  certain centrally managed administrative functions such as finance  information technology  legal and human resources are not 
table of contents assigned to our segments 
interest expense is also excluded from segment results because we manage our financing on a total company basis and have not allocated assets or debt to specific segments 
in addition  other income expense does not relate to our segment operations and is therefore excluded from our segment results 
as discussed under the heading management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  beginning in the first quarter of  we plan to report our operations under the following four segments consumer  business  wholesale and data hosting 
regional markets the operations of our regional markets segment have been impacted by several significant trends  including those described below 
strategic services 
we continue to focus on increasing subscribers of our broadband services in our regional markets segment 
in order to remain competitive  we believe continually increasing connection speeds is important 
as a result  we continue to invest in our broadband network  which allows for the delivery of higher speed broadband services 
while traditional broadband services are declining  they have been more than offset by growth in fiber based broadband services 
we also continue to expand our product offerings including facilities based video services  ethernet  mpls and other managed services and we continue to refine our marketing efforts as we compete in a maturing market in which most consumers already have broadband services 
we expect these efforts will improve our ability to compete and increase our strategic revenues  facilities based video expenses 
as we continue to expand our facilities based video service infrastructure  we are incurring start up expenses in advance of the revenue that this service is expected to generate 
although  over time  we expect that our revenue for facilities based video services will offset the expenses incurred  the timing of this revenue growth is uncertain  access lines 
our voice revenues have been  and we expect they will continue to be  adversely affected by access line losses 
intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses 
for example  many consumers are substituting cable and wireless voice and electronic mail  texting and social networking services for traditional voice telecommunications services 
we expect that these factors will continue to negatively impact our business 
as a result of the expected loss of revenues associated with access lines  we continue to offer service bundling and other product promotions to help mitigate this trend  as described below  service bundling and product promotions 
we offer our customers the ability to bundle multiple products and services 
these customers can bundle local services with other services such as broadband  video  long distance and wireless  data integration 
we expect both data integration revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as this offering tends to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our state and local government customers  many of whom have recently experienced budget cuts  and operating efficiencies 
we continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus 
this involves balancing our segment workforce in response to our workload requirements  productivity improvements and changes in industry  competitive  technological and regulatory conditions 

table of contents the following table summarizes the results of operations from our regional markets segment regional markets segment years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions segment revenues strategic services legacy services data integration total revenues segment expenses direct allocated total expenses segment income segment margin percentage segment income the acquisition of qwest on april  largely contributed to an increase in our regional markets segment income of million for the year ended december  as compared to our consolidated segment margin percentage remained relatively unchanged from to segment income for our legacy centurylink operations decreased million as compared to reflecting declines in revenues while expenses remained relatively flat 
segment revenues excluding revenues attributable to the legacy qwest and legacy savvis acquisitions  regional markets revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to due to declines in legacy services revenues and the implementation of the caf order  partially offset by growth in strategic services revenues 
legacy services revenues decreased primarily due to declines in local and long distance services associated principally with access line losses resulting from the competitive pressures and product substitution described previously 
growth in strategic services revenues was principally due to increases in the number of broadband subscribers as well as volume increases in our facilities based video  ethernet  and mpls services 
segment expenses regional markets total expenses  exclusive of legacy qwest and legacy savvis expenses  increased million for the year ended december  as compared to  due to an increase in allocated expenses 
allocated expenses increased primarily due to our updated methodology more fully allocating to our segments network and building rent and related power expenses 
direct expenses decreased due to decreases in employee related expenses  fleet expenses and marketing costs  which were partially offset by increases in customer premise equipment costs and network service costs 

table of contents wholesale markets the operations of our wholesale markets segment have been impacted by several significant trends  including those described below private line services including special access 
demand for our private line services continues to increase  despite our customers optimization of their networks  industry consolidation and technological migration 
while we expect that these factors could negatively impact our wholesale markets segment  we ultimately believe the bandwidth consumption growth in our fiber based special access services provided to wireless carriers for backhaul will  over time  offset the decline in copper based special access services provided to wireless carriers as they migrate to ethernet services  although the timing and magnitude of this technological migration is uncertain  access and local services revenues 
our access and local services revenues have been and we expect will continue to be  adversely affected by technological migration  industry consolidation  regulation and rate reductions 
for example  wholesale consumers are substituting cable  wireless and voip services for traditional voice telecommunications services  resulting in continued access revenue loss 
we expect these factors will continue to adversely impact our wholesale markets segment  switched access revenues 
we believe that changes related to the connect america and intercarrier compensation reform order caf order adopted by the federal communications commission fcc on october  will substantially increase the pace of reductions in the amount of switched access revenues we receive in our wholesale markets segment  long distance services revenues 
wholesale long distance revenues continue to decline as a result of customer migration to more technologically advanced services  price compression  declining demand for traditional voice services and industry consolidation  and operating efficiencies 
we continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus 
this involves balancing our segment workforce in response to our workload requirements  productivity improvements and changes in industry  competitive  technological and regulatory conditions 
we also expect our wholesale markets segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company wide network operations 

table of contents the following table summarizes the results of operations from our wholesale markets segment wholesale markets segment years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions segment revenues strategic services legacy services data integration total revenues segment expenses direct allocated total expenses segment income segment margin percentage segment income the acquisition of qwest on april  largely contributed to an increase in our wholesale markets segment income of million for the year ended december  as compared to segment income for our legacy centurylink operations decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to  primarily reflecting declines in revenues  as discussed further below 
segment revenues excluding revenues attributable to the legacy qwest and legacy savvis acquisitions  wholesale markets revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease reflects substantially lower revenues from legacy services  partially offset by growth in revenues from strategic services 
strategic services revenues increased primarily due to growth in ethernet and broadband services 
the decrease in legacy services revenues was driven by continuing declines in access  long distance and local services volumes  and the implementation of the caf order  as well as the substitution of cable  wireless  voip and other services for traditional voice telecommunications services 
segment expenses wholesale markets expenses  exclusive of legacy qwest and legacy savvis expenses  decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the decrease in legacy centurylink wholesale markets expenses was primarily due to a lower allocation of fleet and network real estate expenses due to the above described updated expense allocation methodology and to reductions in employee related expenses 

table of contents enterprise markets network the operations of our enterprise markets network segment have been impacted by several significant trends  including those described below 
strategic services 
our mix of total segment revenues continues to migrate from legacy services to strategic services as our enterprise and government customers increasingly demand customized and integrated data  internet and voice services 
we offer to our enterprise customers diverse combinations of products and services such as private line  mpls and voip services 
we believe these services afford our customers more flexibility in managing their communications needs and enable us to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their operations 
although we are experiencing price compression on our strategic services due to competition  we expect overall revenues from these services to grow  legacy services 
we face intense competition with respect to our legacy services and continue to see customers migrating away from these services into strategic services 
in addition  our legacy services revenues have been  and we expect they will continue to be  adversely affected by access line losses and price compression  data integration 
we expect both data integration revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as this offering tends to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our federal government customers 
in addition  changes to our compensation programs  which focus on higher margin strategic services  could negatively impact data integration revenues  and operating efficiencies 
we continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus 
this involves balancing our segment workforce in response to our productivity improvements while achieving operational efficiencies and improving our processes through automation 
we also expect our enterprise markets network segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company wide network operations

segment revenues excluding revenues attributable to the legacy qwest and legacy savvis acquisitions  enterprise markets network segment revenues increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to growth in strategic services revenues from increased volumes of mpls services and increased data integration revenues from maintenance and installation of customer premise equipment 
lower revenues from legacy services were driven by access line losses and price compression partially offset the increases in strategic services revenues and data integration revenues 
segment expenses enterprise markets network segment expenses  exclusive of legacy qwest and legacy savvis expenses  decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to decreased allocated expenses partially offset by increased direct expenses 
allocated expenses decreased for the year ended december  due to lower allocation of fleet and network real estate expenses due to the above described updated expense allocation methodology 
the increase in direct expenses was primarily due to increased maintenance and installation costs associated with customer premise equipment  partially offset by decreases in employee related expenses 
enterprise markets data hosting the operations of our enterprise markets data hosting segment is largely comprised of the operations of our legacy savvis services for periods after the july  acquisition date  which have been impacted by significant trends  including those described below 
colocation 
colocation is designed for clients seeking data center space and power for their server and networking equipment needs 
our data centers provide our domestic and international clients with a secure  high powered  purpose built location for their it equipment 
we anticipate continued pricing pressure for these services as wholesale vendors enter the enterprise colocation market  however  we believe that our combination of global data center assets  operational expertise and broad range of services strengthens our competitive position  managed hosting 
our managed hosting services provide a fully managed solution for a customer it infrastructure and network needs  and include dedicated and cloud hosting services  utility and computing storage  consulting and managed security services 
we expect increasing pricing pressure on the managed hosting business from competing cloud hosting offerings 
however  we remain focused on expanding our managed hosting business  specifically in our cloud hosting offerings  which we believe is a key to growth 
we believe that we have continued to strengthen our position in the cloud hosting market by adding differentiating features to our cloud hosting products  and operating efficiencies 
we continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus 
this involves balancing our segment workforce in response to our workload requirements  productivity improvements and changes in industry  competitive  technological and regulatory conditions

segment expenses excluding the expenses attributable to the legacy qwest and legacy savvis acquisitions  enterprise markets data hosting segment direct expenses increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits caused by a higher headcount and an increase in facility costs 
due to the continuing use of legacy savvis accounting systems  the direct expenses of our enterprise markets data hosting segment includes certain data communication  operational  and selling  general  and administrative costs that are allocated to our other three segments and are offset by corporate allocated expenses which resulted in a negative net allocation impact 
other operational matters approximately of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that expired on october  we are currently negotiating the terms of new agreements 
in the meantime  the predecessor agreements have been extended  and the applicable unions have agreed to provide us with at least hour advance notice before terminating those predecessor agreements 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions  or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage  our business and operating results could 
table of contents be materially harmed 
see risk factors other risks affecting our business in item a of this report 
to help mitigate this potential risk  we have established contingency plans in which we would assign trained  non represented employees to cover jobs for represented employees in the event of a work stoppage to provide continuity for our customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to i business combinations  ii goodwill  customer relationships and other intangible assets  iii property  plant and equipment  iv pension and post retirement benefits  v loss contingencies and litigation reserves  and vi income taxes 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact  or they have the potential to have a material impact  on our consolidated financial statements and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below are reasonable  based on information available at the time they are made 
however  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
business combinations we have accounted for our acquisitions of qwest on april  and savvis on july  under the acquisition method of accounting  whereby the tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the portion of the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the estimates of fair value and resulting allocation of the purchase price related to our acquisitions of qwest and savvis involved significant estimates and judgments by our management 
in arriving at the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  we considered the following generally accepted valuation approaches the cost approach  income approach and market approach 
our estimates also included assumptions about projected growth rates  cost of capital  effective tax rates  tax amortization periods  technology life cycles  the regulatory and legal environment and industry and economic trends 
small changes in the underlying assumptions could impact the estimates of fair value by material amounts  which could in turn materially impact our results of operations 
goodwill  customer relationships and other intangible assets we amortize customer relationships over primarily over an estimated life of years to years  using either the sum of the years digits or straight line methods  depending on the type of customer 
we amortize capitalized software  which consists primarily of assets obtained from the qwest acquisition  using the straight line method over estimated lives ranging up to seven years 
approximately million of our capitalized software represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system and is being amortized over a year period that began in we amortize trade names and patent assets predominantly using the sum of the years digits over an estimated life of four years 
other intangible assets not arising from business combinations are initially recorded at cost 
where there are no legal  regulatory  contractual or other factors that would reasonably limit the useful life of an intangible asset  we classify the intangible asset as indefinite lived and such intangible assets are not amortized 
we periodically review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize our other intangible assets 
the amount of future amortization expense may differ materially from current amounts  depending on the results of our periodic reviews 

table of contents our long lived intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually  or  under certain circumstances  more frequently  such as when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment 
these assets are carried at historical cost if their estimated fair value is greater than their carrying amounts 
however  if their estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  other indefinite lived intangible assets are reduced to their estimated fair value through an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations 
we early adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  during the fourth quarter of  which allows us the option to first review qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of whether the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired before performing a qualitative impairment test 
under this approach  if we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  we will be required to compute and compare the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying amount to determine and measure the impairment loss  if any 
we completed our qualitative assessment as of december  and concluded it is not more likely than not that our indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired  thus  no impairment charge was recorded in our goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired 
for more information on our recent acquisitions and resulting fair values  see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units each time we reorganize our internal reporting structure which causes a change in our operating segments 
goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach 
we utilize the earnings before interest  tax and depreciation as our allocation methodology as it represents a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the operations being reorganized 
we have attributed our goodwill balance to our segments at december  as follows dollars in millions regional markets wholesale markets enterprise markets network enterprise markets data hosting total goodwill for additional information on the april  reorganization of our segments  see note segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we are required to write down the value of goodwill in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value 
our reporting units  which we refer to as our segments  are not discrete legal entities with discrete financial statements 
our assets and liabilities are employed in and relate to the operations of multiple reporting units 
therefore  each time we perform goodwill impairment analysis on a reporting unit  we estimate the equity carrying value and future cash flows of each of our segments using allocation methodologies 
certain estimates  judgments and assumptions are required to perform these allocations 
we believe these estimates  judgments and assumptions to be reasonable  but slight changes in many of these can significantly affect each reporting unit equity carrying value and future cash flows utilized for our goodwill impairment test 
our annual measurement date for testing goodwill impairment is september as of september   we tested for goodwill impairment on our reporting units  which were our four operating segments regional markets  wholesale markets  
table of contents enterprise markets network and enterprise markets data hosting that we recognized following our internal reorganization earlier in in the third quarter of  we adopted the provisions of asu  testing goodwill for impairment  which permits us to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test  which requires us i in step one  to identify potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying value and ii in step two  to quantify any impairment identified in step one 
at september   as a result of the april  internal reorganization of our four segments we did not have a baseline valuation to perform a qualitative assessment 
we estimated the fair value of our four segments using an equal weighting based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow method 
the market approach includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to ours 
the discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value  which represents the expected normalized cash flows of the segments beyond the cash flows from the discrete nine year projection period 
we discounted the estimated cash flows for our regional markets  wholesale markets  and enterprise markets network segments using a rate that represents a market participant weighted average cost of capital  which we determined to be approximately as of the measurement date which was comprised of an after tax cost of debt of and a cost of equity of 
we discounted the estimated cash flows of our enterprise markets data hosting segment using a rate that represents a market participant estimated weighted average cost of capital  which we determined to be approximately as of the measurement date which was comprised of an after tax cost of debt of and a cost of equity of 
we also reconciled the estimated fair values of the segments to our market capitalization as of september  and concluded that the indicated implied control premium of approximately was reasonable based on recent transactions in the market place 
based on our analysis performed with respect to our reporting units described above  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of september  as of september   based on our analysis performed with respect to our four reporting units  the estimated fair value of our equity exceeded our carrying value of equity for our regional markets  wholesale markets  enterprise markets network and enterprise markets data hosting segments by   and  respectively 
we may be required to assess our goodwill for impairment before our next required testing date of september  under certain circumstances  including any failure of our future operating results to meet forecasted expectations or any significant increases in our weighted average cost of capital 
in addition  we cannot assure that adverse conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment testing or an impairment charge 
a number of factors  many of which we have no ability to control  could affect our financial condition  operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment testing 
these factors include  but are not limited to  i further weakening in the overall economy  ii a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization  iii changes in the discount rate  iv successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets  v adverse changes as a result of regulatory actions  vi a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the overall business climate  and vii recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of our reporting units 
for additional information  see risk factors in item a of this report 
we will continue to monitor certain events that impact our operations to determine if an interim assessment of goodwill impairment should be performed prior to the next required testing date of september  
table of contents property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its estimated fair value as of its acquisition date 
property  plant and equipment purchased subsequent to our acquisitions is recorded at cost plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation 
renewals and betterments of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs  as well as renewals of minor items  are charged to operating expense 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is provided on the straight line method using class or overall group rates 
the group method provides for the recognition of the remaining net investment  less anticipated net salvage value  over the remaining useful life of the assets 
this method requires the periodic revision of depreciation rates 
normal retirements of property  plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation  with no gain or loss recognized 
other types of property  plant and equipment are stated at cost and  when sold or retired  a gain or loss is recognized 
we depreciate such property on the straight line method over estimated service lives ranging from to years 
we perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the depreciable lives for our property  plant and equipment 
our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  assumptions about technology evolution and  in certain instances  actuarially determined probabilities to estimate the remaining life of our asset base 
due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment  selecting the estimated economic life of telecommunications plant  equipment and software requires a significant amount of judgment 
we regularly review data on utilization of equipment  asset retirements and salvage values to determine adjustments to our depreciation rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one year increase or decrease in the estimated remaining useful lives of our property  plant and equipment would have decreased depreciation by approximately million or increased depreciation by approximately million  respectively 
we review long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
for measurement purposes  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities  absent a material change in operations 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
recoverability of the asset group to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the asset group carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value 
we determine fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
during  we did not incur changes in events or circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amounts of our long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  may not be recoverable 
as a result  no impairment charge was recorded in pension and post retirement benefits we sponsor several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans referred to as our pension plans for a substantial portion of our employees 
in addition to these tax qualified pension plans  we also maintain several non qualified pension plans for certain eligible highly compensated employees 
we also maintain post retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees 

table of contents pension and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits attributed to eligible employees service during the year  as well as interest on benefit obligations  are accrued currently 
pension and post retirement benefit expenses are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits as determined using the projected unit credit method 
pension prior service costs and certain actuarial gains and losses are recognized as components of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits 
post retirement healthcare prior service costs are recognized as components of net periodic expense over the average expected years to full benefit eligibility for active employees 
certain post retirement actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the average expected future working lifetime of active employees 
in computing the pension and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits expenses and obligations  the most significant assumptions we make include discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  health care trend rates and our evaluation of the legal basis for plan amendments 
the plan benefits covered by collective bargaining agreements as negotiated with our employees unions can also significantly impact the amount of expense  benefit obligations and pension assets that we record 
the discount rate is the rate at which we believe we could effectively settle the benefit obligations as of the end of the year 
we selected the discount rate based on a cash flow matching analysis using hypothetical yield curves developed by an actuarial firm from us corporate bonds rated high quality and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans 
this process establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year 
the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the th to th percentile of us high quality bonds 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is the long term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans assets in the future 
the rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long term risk and return forecast for each asset class 
the forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long term expectations of various third party investment management organizations 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised  as necessary  to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy 
to compute the expected return on pension and post retirement benefit plan assets  we apply an expected rate of return to the fair value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the post retirement benefit plan assets adjusted for contribution timing and for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets 
annual market volatility for these assets is reflected in subsequent years net periodic combined benefits expense 
changes in any of the above factors could significantly impact operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss income as well as the value of the liability and accumulated other comprehensive income loss of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
the expected return on plan assets is reflected as a reduction to our pension and post retirement benefit expense 
if our assumed expected rates of return for were basis points lower  our qualified pension and post retirement benefit expenses would have increased by million 
if our assumed discount rates for were basis points lower  our qualified pension and post retirement benefit expenses would have increased by million and our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately billion 
an increase of basis points in the initial healthcare cost trend rate would have increased our post retirement benefit expense by million and increased our projected post retirement benefit obligation by million 
the trusts for the pension and post retirement benefits plans hold investments in equities  fixed income  real estate and other assets such as private equity assets 
the assets held by these trusts are 
table of contents reflected at estimated fair value as of december  for additional information on our trust investments  see note employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
loss contingencies and litigation reserves we are involved in several material legal proceedings  as described in more detail in legal proceedings in item of this report 
we assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened tax and legal matters 
for matters not related to income taxes  if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we recognize an expense for the estimated loss 
to the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters  our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly 
if the differences are material  our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted 
if a loss is considered reasonably possible  we disclose the estimate of the potential loss if material but we do not recognize any expense for the potential loss 
for matters related to income taxes  we determine that if the impact of an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority  then we recognize a benefit for the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
no portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law  the body of statutory  regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous 
because of this  whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain 
the overall tax liability recorded for uncertain tax positions as of the successor dates of december  and december   considers the anticipated utilization of any applicable tax credits and net operating losses nols 
income taxes our provision for income taxes includes amounts for tax consequences deferred to future periods 
we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax net operating losses  or nols  tax credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the measurement of deferred taxes often involves the exercise of considerable judgment related to the realization of tax basis 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment that tax positions taken in filed tax returns and the resulting tax basis  are more likely than not to be sustained if they are audited by taxing authorities 
also  assessing tax rates that we expect to apply and determining the years when the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income requires judgment about the future apportionment of our income among the states in which we operate 
any changes in our practices or judgments involved in the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities as described above 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be recovered 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to our valuation allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances  such as changes in tax law  interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law 
in making this evaluation  we rely on our recent history of pre tax earnings  estimated timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets and our forecasts of future earnings  the latter two 
table of contents of which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
at december   we established a valuation allowance of million  primarily related to state nols  as it is more likely than not that this amount will not be utilized prior to expiration 
if forecasts of future earnings and the nature and estimated timing of future deductions and benefits change in the future  we may determine that a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets is appropriate  which could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources overview at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million and we had billion available under our billion revolving credit facility referred to as our credit facility  which is described further below 
at december   cash and cash equivalents of million were held in foreign bank accounts for the purpose of funding our foreign operations 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local law and subject to united states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
excluding cash used for acquisitions  we have generally relied on cash generated by operations and our credit facility to fund our operating and capital expenditures and other cash requirements 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million  reflecting current liabilities of billion and current assets of billion  compared to negative working capital of million at december  the unfavorable change in our working capital position is primarily due to an increase in current maturities of long term debt of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
we anticipate that our existing cash balances and net cash provided by operating activities will enable us to meet our other current obligations  fund capital expenditures and pay dividends to our shareholders 
we also may draw on our credit facility as a source of liquidity if and when necessary 
we currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends in respect of our common stock  subject to our board discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time 
credit facilities on april   we amended and restated our billion revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount available to billion and to extend the maturity date to april this amended credit facility the credit facility has lenders  with commitments ranging from million to million and allows us to obtain revolving loans and to issue up to million of letters of credit  which upon issuance reduce the amount available for other extensions of credit 
interest is assessed on borrowings using either the libor or the base rate each as defined in the credit facility plus an applicable margin between and per annum for libor loans and and per annum for base rate loans depending on our then current senior unsecured long term debt rating 
our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by two of our wholly owned subsidiaries  embarq and qcii  and one of qcii wholly owned subsidiaries 
in the event of a ratings decline below investment grade as defined  savvis and its operating subsidiaries will become guarantors of the credit facility 
at december   we had million in borrowings and no amounts of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
under the credit facility  we  and our indirect subsidiary  qwest corporation  must maintain a debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined in our credit facility ratio of not more than and  respectively  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four quarters then ended 
the credit facility also contains a negative pledge covenant  which generally requires us to secure equally and ratably any advances under the credit facility if we 
table of contents pledge assets or permit liens on our property for the benefit of other debtholders 
the credit facility also has a cross payment default provision  and the credit facility and certain of our debt securities also have cross acceleration provisions 
when present  these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument 
to the extent that our ebitda as defined in our credit facility is reduced by cash settlements or judgments  including in respect of any of the matters discussed in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  our debt to ebitda ratios under certain debt agreements will be adversely affected 
this could reduce our financing flexibility due to potential restrictions on incurring additional debt under certain provisions of our debt agreements or  in certain circumstances  could result in a default under certain provisions of such agreements 
in april  we entered into a million uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility 
at december   our outstanding letters of credit totaled million under this facility 
stock repurchase program on february   we announced our board approval of a two year program to repurchase up to an aggregate of billion of our outstanding common stock 
we expect to execute this share repurchase program primarily in open market transactions  subject to market conditions and other factors 
debt and other financing arrangements approximately million of our centurylink  inc series o notes will mature on april   and million of qwest corporation floating rate senior notes will mature on june  in addition  approximately million of embarq notes and million of embarq notes will mature on july  and august   respectively 
subject to market conditions  we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt  including issuing qc debt securities to refinance its maturing debt 
the availability  interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned to us and qc by credit rating agencies  among others factors 
following our announcement on february  of changes in our capital allocation plans  one credit agency downgraded centurylink debt credit ratings and another indicated that it has placed centurylink debt credit ratings under review for a downgrade 
as of the date of this report  the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of centurylink  inc and qwest corporation were as follows agency centurylink  inc qwest corporation standard poor bb bbb moody investors service  inc baa under review for downgrade baa under review for downgrade fitch ratings bb bbb additional downgrades of centurylink senior unsecured debt ratings could under certain circumstances incrementally increase the cost of our borrowing under the credit facility or require us to add a couple of additional subsidiary guarantors thereunder 
in addition  the recent actions of the credit agencies  and any additional downgrades in the future  could impact our access to debt capital or further raise our borrowing costs

table of contents future contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated future contractual obligations as of december  and thereafter total dollars in millions long term debt  including current maturities and capital lease obligations interest on long term debt and capital leases operating leases purchase commitments post retirement benefit obligation non qualified pension obligations unrecognized tax benefits other total future contractual obligations actual interest paid in all years may differ due to future refinancing of debt 
interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective at december  we have various long term  non cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services  including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events 
we also have service related commitments with various vendors for data processing  technical and software support services 
future payments under certain service contracts will vary depending on our actual usage 
in the table above we estimated payments for these service contracts based on the level of services we expect to receive 
represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay for our unrecognized tax benefits 
of our total balance of unrecognized tax benefits of million and related estimated interest and penalties of million  only million would result in future cash payments if our tax positions were not upheld 
the remaining million is an unrecognized tax benefit in the form of a refund claim that  if not granted  would not result in a cash payment and therefore is not included in the table above 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
the timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted with certainty  therefore  such amount is reflected in the and thereafter column in the above table 
the table is limited to contractual obligations only and does not include contingent liabilities  our open purchase orders as of december  these purchase orders are generally issued at fair value  and are generally cancelable without penalty  other long term liabilities  such as accruals for legal matters and other taxes that are not contractual obligations by nature 
we cannot determine with any degree of reliability the years in which these liabilities might ultimately settle  cash funding requirements for qualified pension benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees 
benefits paid by our qualified pension plans are paid through trusts 
cash funding requirements for these trusts are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate required contributions to the trusts 
our funding projections are discussed further below  certain post retirement benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees 
not all of our post retirement benefit obligation amount is a contractual obligation and only the portion that we believe is a contractual obligation is reported in the table 
see additional information on our benefits plans in note employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  
table of contents contract termination fees 
these fees are non recurring payments  the timing and payment of which  if any  is uncertain 
in the ordinary course of business and to optimize our cost structure  we enter into contracts with terms greater than one year to use the network facilities of other carriers and to purchase other goods and services 
our contracts to use other carriers network facilities generally have no minimum volume requirements and are based on an interrelationship of volumes and discounted rates 
assuming we terminate these contracts in  the contract termination fees would be approximately million 
under the same assumption  termination fees for these contracts to purchase goods and services would be million 
in the normal course of business  we do not believe payment of these fees is likely  and potential indemnification obligations to counterparties in certain agreements entered into in the normal course of business 
the nature and terms of these arrangements vary 
historically  we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these types of arrangements 
capital expenditures we incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks  compete effectively in our markets and expand our service offerings 
we evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors  including expected strategic impacts such as forecasted revenue growth  operating  productivity  expense or service impacts and our expected return on investment 
the amount of capital investment is influenced by  among other things  demand for our services and products  cash flow generated by operating activities  cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations 
we estimate our total capital expenditures to be approximately billion to billion 
our capital expenditures continue to be focused on our strategic services such as video  broadband and managed hosting services 
in particular  we expect to continue to focus on expanding our fiber infrastructure  including installations of fiber to the tower  which is a type of telecommunications network consisting of fiber optic cables that run from a wireless carrier mobile telephone switching office to cellular towers to enable the delivery of higher bandwidth services supporting mobile technologies than would otherwise generally be available through a more traditional copper based telecommunications network 
for more information on capital spending  see items and a of this report 
we have agreed to accept approximately million of the million available to us from phase of the fcc connect america fund caf established by congress to help telecommunications carriers defray the cost of providing broadband access to remote customers 
we intend to use the funds to deploy broadband service for up to  homes in unserved rural areas principally in colorado  minnesota  new mexico  virginia and washington 
we determined that restrictions on the use of these funds have made acceptance of additional caf funds uneconomical 
we have  however  filed with the fcc a waiver application  which  if granted  would allow us to deploy broadband services with caf funds to approximately  more homes in high cost unserved areas in our markets 
we received approximately million in caf funds during and received approximately million in january pension and post retirement benefit obligations we are subject to material obligations under our existing defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans 
the accounting unfunded status as of december  of our defined pension plans and other post retirement benefit obligations were billion and billion  respectively 
see note employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information about our pension and other post retirement benefit arrangements 
benefits paid by our qualified pension plans are paid through a trust that holds all plan assets 
we made cash contributions of million during the year ended december  to our qualified pension plans 
in the first quarter of  we made cash contributions totaling million 
based on current laws and circumstances  we do not expect any further required contributions to the plans for 
table of contents the remainder of for information on a law that reduced the amount of our required pension plan cash contributions  please see our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  certain of our post retirement health care and life insurance benefits plans are unfunded 
several trusts hold assets that are used to help cover the health care costs of certain retirees 
as of december   the fair value of these trust assets was million  however  a portion of these assets is comprised of investments with restricted liquidity 
we estimate that the more liquid assets in the trust will be adequate to provide continuing reimbursements for covered post retirement health care costs for approximately four years 
thereafter  covered benefits will be paid either directly by us or from the trusts as the remaining assets become liquid 
this projected four year period could be substantially shorter or longer depending on returns on plan assets  the timing of maturities of illiquid plan assets and future changes in benefits 
our estimated annual long term rate of return on the pension plans trust assets is and for the post retirement plans trust assets ranges from to based on the assets currently held  however  actual returns could vary widely in any given year

table of contents net cash used in financing activities increased in compared to  primarily due to a net long term debt pay down of billion in versus a net long term debt issuance of billion in  a billion difference 
this difference was primarily due to the billion senior notes issued in june to finance the savvis acquisition 
also contributing was a million increase in dividends paid attributable to an increase in the average number of shares outstanding 
these increases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a million increase in net borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash used in financing activities decreased in primarily due to us receiving net debt proceeds in excess of payments of approximately billion in versus debt payments of million in in addition  our cash dividends paid increased million in as compared to primarily as a result of the issuance of million common shares in connection with our acquisitions of qwest and savvis in on october   qcii redeemed all million of its notes due  which resulted in a gain of million

on april   centurylink entered into a term loan in the amount of million with cobank and several other farm credit system banks 
this term loan is payable in consecutive quarterly installments of million in principal plus interest through april   when the balance will be due 
we have the option of paying monthly interest based upon either london interbank offered rate libor or the base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin between to per annum for libor loans and to per annum for base rate loans depending on our then current senior unsecured long term debt rating 
our term loan is guaranteed by two of our wholly owned subsidiaries  embarq and qwest communications international inc qcii  and one of qcii wholly owned subsidiaries

certain matters related to acquisitions qwest pre existing debt obligations consisted primarily of debt securities issued by qcii and two of its subsidiaries while savvis remaining long term debt obligations consist primarily of capital leases  all of which are now included in our consolidated debt balances 
the indentures governing qwest debt securities contain customary covenants that restrict the ability of qwest or its subsidiaries from making certain payments and investments  granting liens and selling or transferring assets 
based on current circumstances  we do not anticipate that these covenants will significantly restrict our ability to manage cash balances or transfer cash between entities within our consolidated group of companies as needed 
in accounting for the qwest acquisition  we recorded qwest debt securities at their estimated fair values  which totaled billion as of april  our acquisition date fair value estimates were based primarily on quoted market prices in active markets and other observable inputs where quoted market prices were not available 
the fair value of qwest debt securities exceeded their stated principal balances on the acquisition date by million  which we recorded as a premium 

table of contents the table below summarizes the portions of this premium recognized as a reduction to interest expense or extinguished during the periods indicated years ended december  total since acquisition dollars in millions amortized extinguished total premiums recognized see debt and other financing arrangements for more information the remaining premium of million as of december  will reduce interest expense in future periods  unless otherwise extinguished 
net operating loss carryforwards we are currently using federal nols to offset a portion of our federal taxable income 
we expect to deplete a significant portion of these nols and certain other deferred tax attributes by  and substantially all of these tax benefits by once our nols are fully utilized  we expect that the amounts of our cash flows dedicated to the payment of federal taxes will increase substantially 
the amounts of those payments will depend upon many factors  including future earnings  tax law changes and future tax circumstances 
for additional information  see risk factors risks related to our recent acquisitions appearing in item a of part ii of this report 
other matters centurylink has cash management arrangements with certain of its principal subsidiaries  in which substantial portions of the subsidiaries cash is regularly advanced to centurylink 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these advances are eliminated as intercompany transactions 
although centurylink periodically repays these advances to fund the subsidiaries cash requirements throughout the year  at any given point in time we may owe a substantial sum to our subsidiaries under these advances  which are not recognized on our consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with reclassifying certain wireless spectrum assets as assets held for sale  during the second quarter of we reclassified million from other intangible assets  net to current assets other

we also are involved in various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
see note commitment and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for the current status of such legal proceedings  including matters involving qwest 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate long term debt obligations and fluctuations in certain foreign currencies 
we seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates 

table of contents from time to time  we have used derivative instruments to i lock in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or ii to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates 
as of december   we had no such instruments outstanding 
we have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure 
there were no material changes to market risks arising from changes in interest rates for the year ended december   when compared to the disclosures provided in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  at december   we have approximately billion excluding capital lease and other obligations with a carrying amount of million of long term debt outstanding  of which bears interest at fixed rates and is therefore not exposed to interest rate risk 
we had billion floating rate debt exposed to changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in libor relative to this debt would decrease our annual pre tax earnings by million 
with our acquisition of savvis in july  we have become exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which its international operations are denominated  primarily the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar  the japanese yen and the singapore dollar 
as a consolidated entity  the percentage of revenues generated and costs incurred that are denominated in these currencies are immaterial 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to this foreign currency risk  measuring the change in financial position arising from hypothetical change in the exchange rates of these currencies  relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant 
the aggregate potential change in the fair value of assets resulting from a hypothetical change in these exchange rates was million at december  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of exposures to market risks 
actual values may differ materially from those presented above if market conditions vary from the assumptions used in the analyses performed 
these analyses only incorporate the risk exposures that existed at december  off balance sheet arrangements we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing  hedging  or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not i reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements  ii disclosed in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  or in the future contractual obligations table included in this item above or iii discussed under the heading market risk above
