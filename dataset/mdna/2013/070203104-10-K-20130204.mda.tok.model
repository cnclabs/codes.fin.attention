item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
our investment balances at each of the last three fiscal year ends are as follows november  november  november  certain retail real estate zenith recorded in other long term assets other marketable securities fortress ihfc we hold investments in retail store property that we either lease or have previously leased to licensees 
these holdings  which also include closed store real estate currently leased to non licensees  are presented as a long term asset in our consolidated balance sheets 
these real estate holdings are typically in urban  high traffic retail locations 
see item  properties  for additional information about our retail real estate holdings 
our investment in fortress represented the last remaining asset from the former hedge fund investment holdings of our alternative asset fund  substantially all of which had been liquidated prior to due to significant declines in net asset values of fortress during the first quarter of fiscal  the highly illiquid nature of the investment  and the high degree of uncertainty regarding our ability to recover our investment in the foreseeable future  we fully reserved the carrying amount of this investment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we completed the liquidation of our marketable securities portfolio  which had at the time consisted of bond mutual funds and fixed income securities 
previous holdings of equity securities had been liquidated during and in addition  money market fund assets previously classified as part of our investment portfolio at november  were reclassified as cash equivalents during fiscal due to the release of collateral restrictions which had been in place as part of a former credit agreement 
trademarks and patents our trademarks  including bassett and the names of some of our marketing divisions  products and collections  are significant to the conduct of our business 
this is important due to consumer recognition of the names and identification with our broad range of products 
certain of our trademarks are licensed to independent retailers for use in full store and store gallery presentations of our products 
we also own copyrights that are important in the conduct of our business 
research and development the furniture industry is considered to be a fashion industry subject to constant fluctuations to meet changing consumer preferences and tastes 
as such  we are continuously involved in the development of new designs and products 
due to the nature of these efforts and the close relationship to the manufacturing operations  these costs are considered normal operating costs and are not segregated 
we are not otherwise involved in traditional research and development activities nor do we sponsor the research and development activities of any of our customers 
government regulations we believe that we have materially complied with all federal  state and local standards in the areas of safety  health and pollution and environmental controls 
we are involved in environmental matters at certain of our plant facilities  which arise in the normal course of business 
although the final outcome of these environmental matters cannot be determined  based on the present facts  we do not believe that the final resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
we may also be affected by laws and regulations of countries from which we source goods 
labor  environmental  and other laws and regulations change over time  especially in the developing countries from which we source 
changes in these areas of regulation could negatively impact the cost and availability of sourced goods 
the timing and extent to which these regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is difficult to predict 
based on the present facts  we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
people we employed  people as of november   of which were employed in our retail segment and were employed in our wholesale segment 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining arrangements and we have not experienced any recent work stoppages 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
foreign and domestic operations and export sales we have no foreign manufacturing or retail operations 
we define export sales as sales to any country or territory other than the united states or its territories or possessions 
our export sales were approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
at november  and november   we had  and  respectively of our finished goods inventory physically warehoused in vietnam and indonesia 
major customers our risk exposure related to our customers  consisting primarily of trade accounts receivable along with other notes receivable and certain guarantees  totaled approximately  and  at november  and november   respectively 
at november  approximately of the aggregate risk exposure  net of reserves  shown above was attributable to one licensee 
at november   approximately of the aggregate risk exposure  net of reserves  shown above was attributable to two licensees accounting for approximately each 
in fiscal  and  no customer accounted for more than of total net sales

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking information contained in this annual report on form k 
the risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operations  industry  financial position or future financial results 
we face a volatile retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending 
the home furnishings industry has experienced a difficult period over the last years marked with depressed housing starts  high unemployment  changing consumer confidence and uncertain fiscal policies 
while showed improvement  considerable economic uncertainty still exists 
historically  the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects 
should the current economic recovery falter or the current recovery in housing starts stall  consumer confidence and demand for home furnishings could deteriorate which could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our company owned stores  as well as our licensees and the ability of a number of them to meet their obligations to us 
unsuccessful implementation of the hgtv open market strategy and the development of a new furniture brand could be detrimental to future operating results 
in september of  we announced the formation of a strategic partnership with hgtv  a division of scripps networks  llc  which combines our year heritage in the furniture industry with the penetration of million households in the united states that hgtv enjoys today 
as part of this alliance  we have developed  in conjunction with hgtv  a new line of furniture that contains only the hgtv home collection brand and will be primarily marketed through select top furniture retailers 
we have incurred significant expense to design and procure the furniture and develop the in house infrastructure to manage the brand 
should we not generate the incremental sales necessary to appropriately leverage the additional costs  future operating results could be adversely impacted 
our use of foreign sources of production for a substantial portion of our products exposes us to certain additional risks associated with international operations 
our use of foreign sources for the supply of many of our products exposes us to risks associated with overseas sourcing 
these risks are related to government regulation  delays in shipments  and extended lead time in ordering 
governments in the foreign countries where we source our products may change their laws  regulations and policies  including those related to tariffs and trade barriers  investments  taxation and exchange controls which could make it more difficult to service our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings 
shipping delays and extended order lead times may adversely affect our ability to respond to sudden changes in demand  resulting in the purchase of excess inventory in the face of declining demand  or lost sales due to insufficient inventory in the face of increasing demand  either of which would also have an adverse effect on our earnings or liquidity 
our company owned stores may not achieve the anticipated growth and profitability 
our company owned stores currently operate at a loss 
our goal is to operate these stores at a level of modest profitability to enhance operating margins generated by our wholesale operation 
to be successful  we need to increase our sales per store while decreasing the support costs as a percentage of sales 
as part of our strategy  we must hire  train and retain a qualified staff of design consultants to improve the customer experience 
competition with other furniture retailers for qualified design consultants also continues to increase 
we also compete with other retailers for management personnel and appropriate retail locations 
failures and delays in implementing our retail strategies or failure to realize the benefits of these strategies could adversely impact our business and operating results 
our licensee owned stores may not be able to meet their obligations to us 
we have a significant amount of accounts receivable from our network of licensee owned stores 
we also own some of the real estate that is leased to our licensees and guarantee some of the leases of some of our licensees 
if these stores do not generate the necessary level of sales and profits  they may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us resulting in additional bad debt expenses and real estate related losses 
failure to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
sales of our furniture are dependent upon consumer acceptance of our designs  styles  quality and price 
as with all retailers  our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends 
we attempt to monitor changes in consumer tastes and home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows  internal marketing research  and communication with our retailers and design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies 
however  such tastes and trends can change rapidly and any delay or failure to anticipate or respond to changing consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends upon our brand  marketing and advertising efforts and pricing strategies  and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand  or if we are not successful in these efforts and strategies  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both company owned and licensee owned stores 
our advertising and marketing campaign utilizes television  direct mail  catalogs  newspapers  magazines  radio and the internet in an effort to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity 
we cannot provide assurance that our marketing  advertising and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will not require us to incur substantial costs 
if these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
manufacturing realignments could result in a decrease in our near term earnings 
we regularly review and evaluate our domestic manufacturing operations and offshore import sourcing capabilities 
as a result  we sometimes realign those operations and capabilities and institute cost savings programs 
these programs can include the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures 
we also may shift certain products from domestic manufacturing to offshore sourcing 
these realignments and cost savings programs generally involve some initial cost and can result in decreases in our near term earnings until we achieve the expected cost reductions 
failure to accomplish these actions as quickly as planned  or failure to fully achieve the expected cost reductions  could adversely impact our operating results and financial conditions 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales  either of which could adversely impact our earnings 
we use various types of wood  foam  fibers  fabrics  leathers  and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture 
certain of our raw materials  including fabrics  are purchased both abroad and domestically 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or a delay in manufacturing our products  which in turn could result in a delay in delivering products to our customers 
for example  lumber prices fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand  which in turn impact availability 
production delays or upward trends in raw material prices could result in lower sales or margins  thereby adversely impacting our earnings 
in addition  certain suppliers may require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to produce products in the quantities we desire 
this long lead time may require us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale  thereby exposing us to risks relating to shifts in consumer demand and trends  and any further downturn in the us economy 
our pre tax income for the year ended november  includes a significant non recurring gain from the sale of our investment in ihfc and is therefore not typical of our recent results nor indicative of future results  and earnings and cash flows previously provided by our investment in ihfc will no longer continue in the future 
our results for the year ended november  were favorably impacted by a non recurring gain of  resulting from the sale of our interest in ihfc  and our liquidity position was substantially improved by the receipt of  in proceeds from that sale 
absent the ihfc transaction  we had not reported pretax income for any of the five fiscal years through november  furthermore  significant earnings and cash flows previously realized from our investment in ihfc have ceased following the sale  and we have distributed a significant portion of the cash proceeds to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
should we be unable to generate sufficient operating profit and cash flow from our continuing operations in the future  our liquidity will be adversely impacted as the funds provided by the ihfc sale transaction are exhausted 
please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under part ii  item of this annual report on form k for a full discussion of our operating results 
the implementation of a new point of sale system for our retail operations could disrupt our business and have a negative impact on our results from operations 
we are in the process of implementing a new company wide point of sale system for our retail operations 
this system implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our operations 
our inability to mitigate future disruptions could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the implementation subjects us to substantial costs and inherent risks associated with migrating from our legacy system

item legal proceedings in  the us environmental protection agency epa advised us that we had been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at the ward transformer superfund site in wake county  north carolina 
the epa alleges that we are a responsible party because  prior to  we sent transformers to the site for repair that contained certain polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs which were allegedly mishandled by the owner operator of the site 
pursuant to a settlement agreement that we and several other prps the initial prp group entered into with the epa in  the initial prp group has paid for remediation work conducted at the ward transformer site 
to date we have spent approximately  on the remediation of the site  however we estimate that our share of the total liability for remediation of the site should be approximately therefore  through litigation and collection efforts by the initial prp group  we intend to seek recovery from dozens of other prps for our costs in excess of in  our former vendor  colonial trading  inc colonial  filed a lawsuit against us alleging  among other things  breach of contract by the company after we cancelled orders for cribs following product recalls

our products are sold primarily through a network of company owned and licensee owned branded stores under the bassett home furnishings bhf name  with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi line furniture stores  many of which feature bassett galleries or design centers  specialty stores and mass merchants 
we were founded in and incorporated under the laws of virginia in our rich year history has instilled the principles of quality  value  and integrity in everything that we do  while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever changing consumer tastes and to meet the demands of a global economy 
with bhf stores at november   we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of corporate and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories 
we created our store program in to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish  quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service 
the store features custom order furniture ready for delivery in less than days  more than  upholstery fabrics  free in home design visits  and coordinated decorating accessories 
we believe that our capabilities in custom furniture have become unmatched in recent years 
our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options  the precision of its craftsmanship  and the speed of its delivery 
the selling philosophy in the stores is based on building strong long term relationships with each customer 
sales people are referred to as design consultants and are each trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor 
we continue to strengthen the sales and design talent within our company owned retail stores 
during  our design consultants completed extensive design certification training coursework 
this coursework has strengthened their skills related to our house call and design business  and is intended to increase business with our most valuable customers 
in order to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network  we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi line furniture stores  many of which feature bassett galleries or design centers  specialty stores and mass merchants 
we believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the united states and ultimately gain market share 
in september of  we announced the formation of a strategic partnership with hgtv  a division of scripps networks  llc  which combines our year heritage in the furniture industry with the penetration of million households in the united states that hgtv enjoys today 
this alliance encompasses strategies for both the bhf store network and other open market sales channels 
for the store network  the in store design centers have been co branded with hgtv to more forcefully market the concept of a home makeover  an important point of differentiation for our stores that also mirrors much of the programming content on the hgtv network 
in addition  we have developed  in conjunction with hgtv  a new line of furniture that contains only the hgtv home collection brand and will be primarily marketed through select top furniture retailers in a phased approach 
shipments of floor samples for phase i were completed in january for retailers with over floors 
floor sample shipments for phase ii dealers will begin in february with completion by april phase iii will begin later in our store network included company owned and operated stores and licensee owned stores at november  during fiscal  we opened two new stores  one in torrance  california in the los angeles market and one in paramus  new jersey in the new york city bergen county market  and we acquired three stores  one store from a licensee in knoxville  tennessee  and two from a licensee in orange county  california 
we also relocated a store within the richmond  virginia market  closing the previous location in glen allen  virginia and opening the new location in short pump  virginia 
one additional store located in austin  texas was closed during the second quarter of in december  a new licensee owned store was opened in san jose  california 
the following table summarizes the changes in store count during fiscal november  openings closed transfers november  company owned stores licensee owned stores total our wholesale operations include an upholstery plant in newton  north carolina that produces a wide range of upholstered furniture 
we believe that we are an industry leader with our quick ship custom upholstery offerings 
we also operate a custom dining manufacturing facility in martinsville  va 
most of our wood furniture and certain of our upholstery offerings are sourced through several foreign plants  primarily in vietnam and indonesia 
we define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced internationally 
for fiscal  approximately of our wholesale sales were of imported product compared to for fiscal traffic to our website  www 
bassettfurniture 
com  continues to grow 
the ultimate goal of our digital strategy is to drive traffic to our retailers while deepening interactions with our consumers 
understanding that more and more consumers are using the web to research before making a purchase  we have worked diligently to enhance our online presence by making it easier for consumers to browse our wide array of goods and build custom furniture 
in  we will continue to make improvements to our website and increase our social media presence to drive more visitors to our website and more qualified prospects to our stores 
while sales through our website are currently not material  they have increased significantly in the last several years 
we are leveraging our company owned and licensed store network to handle delivery and customer service for orders placed online 
although overall conditions for our industry and our company have been difficult over the past several years  there has been improvement during the last year 
housing starts  which our industry tracks as a key leading economic indicator  have been steadily improving for several quarters  although they still remain well below pre recession levels 
consumers continue to be faced with general economic uncertainty fueled by continuing high unemployment and uncertain fiscal policy 
these conditions have limited the resumption of growth for big ticket consumer purchases such as furniture 
consequently  this put pressure on certain of our dealers ability to generate adequate profits to fully pay us for the furniture we have sold to them 
as a result  prior to  we incurred significant bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges 
beginning during the second half of and continuing into  this trend improved significantly as we only incurred bad debt charges of for fiscal compared with  and  for fiscal and  respectively  reflecting improved credit positions with our current fleet of licensees 
we believe that the current level of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during fiscal is more indicative of the expected trend of future charges 
although management will continue to work closely with our licensees to ensure the success of both the licensee and bassett  further store closures are possible should any licensees experience severe deteriorations in their credit positions from which we believe they are unlikely to recover 
analysis of operations our fiscal year ends on the last saturday of november  which periodically results in a week year 
fiscal  and each contained weeks 
net sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative sg a expense  and operating income loss were as follows for the years ended november   november  and november  net sales gross profit sg a bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges other charges income loss from operations sales for fiscal were  as compared to  for and  for  representing increases of and  respectively 
this trend primarily reflects the increase in the number of stores owned and operated by us  as well as growth in our wholesale shipments outside of our licensee network 
our consolidated net sales by segment were as follows wholesale retail inter company elimination consolidated net sales gross margins for fiscal   and were   and  respectively 
the margin increases are primarily attributable to additional retail markup realized as the result of the continued expansion of our company owned store network in our retail segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  increased  in as compared to and increased  in as compared to primarily due to the increase in the number of company owned retail stores as each additional store opening or acquisition results in incremental fixed overhead costs  primarily associated with local store personnel  occupancy costs and warehousing expenses 
the incremental sg a expenses associated with each new store will be ongoing 
in addition  wholesale sg a increased in over primarily due to spending associated with the development of our hgtv initiative 
bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges for fiscal decreased from the prior year by  reflecting the improved credit positions of our current fleet of licensees  whereas bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges had increased  in from levels 
this increase reflected the continued deterioration of certain of our licensees during the first half of as a result  we acquired nine stores from four licensees and closed six stores with three other licensees during fiscal following the takeover or closure of these troubled licensee owned stores  our bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges have averaged approximately per quarter since the third quarter of we believe that this average level of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges is more indicative of the expected trend of future charges 
certain items affecting comparability between periods are noted below in investment and real estate segment and other items affecting net loss 
the following table presents certain significant items that have negatively impacted our results of operations 
we believe these items should be presented separately in order to understand and evaluate our results and trends

the wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design  manufacture  sourcing  sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of bassett stores company owned and licensee owned retail stores and independent furniture retailers 
our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations as well as all corporate selling  general and administrative expenses  including those corporate expenses related to both company and licensee owned stores 
we eliminate the sales between our wholesale and retail segments as well as the imbedded profit in the retail inventory for the consolidated presentation in our financial statements 
retail company owned stores 
our retail segment consists of company owned stores and includes the revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities including real estate and capital expenditures directly related to these stores

wholesale shipments to the bhf store network increased while shipments outside of the network increased 
the slight increase in sales to the store network came in spite of a decline in the total number of bhf stores 
the increase in the wholesale shipments outside the network was primarily due to an increase in the traditional channel partially offset by lower shipments to a significant national account customer 
gross margins for the wholesale segment were for  down slightly from the gross margin of for wholesale sg a  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  increased  to  for as compared to  for as a percentage of net sales  sg a increased percentage points to for as compared to for this increase was primarily due to incremental marketing spend of  associated with the development of the hgtv initiative and a temporary showroom in high point to display the new hgtv furniture 
this increase was partially offset by improved leverage of fixed costs associated with higher sales 
we recorded of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during as compared with  for  which reflects the improved credit positions with our current fleet of licensees 
the bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges which we have experienced since the third quarter of have averaged approximately per quarter

reductions in wholesale sales due to fewer stores in the network were offset by a increase in sales through other channels 
gross margins for the wholesale segment were for as compared to for this increase was primarily due to lower promotional discounts and improved margins in our wood operations largely from reduced container freight costs 
wholesale sg a  excluding bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges  increased  to  for as compared to  for as a percentage of net sales  sg a increased percentage points to for as compared to for this increase was primarily due to higher sales and marketing costs  including costs to prepare for the launch of the hgtv product line

the increase was comprised of an  or  increase in comparable store sales  along with an  increase in non comparable store sales 
contributing to the improvement in comparable store sales were the successful introduction of new products during the second half of  improved merchandising in our stores and improvements in the quality and training of the design associates who sell our products 
in addition  a general improvement in the retail environment in combination with targeted advertising also produced increased traffic through our stores 
while we do not recognize sales until goods are delivered to the customer  our management tracks written sales the dollar value of sales orders taken  rather than delivered as a key store performance indicator 
written sales for comparable stores increased by for fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margins for fiscal increased percentage points to as compared to fiscal due primarily to the adverse impact of store liquidation sales run during related to the closure of seven retail locations 
this increase in margins was also attributable in part to improved pricing strategies and increased sales of higher margin mattresses 
sg a increased  primarily due to increased store count as each additional store opening or acquisition results in incremental fixed overhead costs  primarily associated with local store personnel  occupancy costs and warehousing expenses 
the incremental sg a expenses associated with each new store will be ongoing 
on a comparable store basis  sg a as a percentage of sales decreased percentage points to for fiscal as compared to the fiscal due to increased sales leveraging fixed costs and improved operating efficiencies 
comparable stores had operating income of for fiscal  essentially breaking even for the first time on an annual basis  as compared to a loss of  or of sales  for fiscal in all other stores  the operating loss was  or  of sales  for fiscal  as compared to  or  of sales for fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal our company owned stores had sales of  in as compared to  in  an increase of 
the increase was comprised of a  increase primarily from additional company owned stores and a  or  increase in comparable store sales 
while we do not recognize sales until goods are delivered to the customer  we track written sales the dollar value of sales orders taken  rather than delivered as a key store performance indicator 
written sales for comparable stores increased by in over gross margins for decreased percentage points to as compared to due primarily to lower margins from the store liquidation sales at the seven stores closed  as well as slightly lower margins from comparable stores 
sg a increased  primarily due to increased store count 
on a comparable store basis  sg a decreased percentage points to for as compared to due to increased sales leveraging fixed costs and improved operating efficiencies 
operating losses for the comparable stores decreased by  to  or of sales 
in all other stores  the operating loss was  or of sales 
this higher level of operating losses reflects the fact that the acquired stores were struggling or failing at the time of acquisition 
it has generally taken six to twelve months of operations by corporate retail management to either implement the changes necessary to improve performance in the acquired stores or to make a final determination regarding their on going viability 
retail comparable store sales increases decreases delivered written fiscal fiscal fiscal retail backlog the dollar value of our retail backlog  representing orders received but not yet delivered to customers as of november   november   and november   was as follows year end retail backlog retail backlog per open store investment and real estate segment and other items affecting net income loss at november   our investments and real estate segment consists of our equity investment in zenith  and our investments in retail real estate related to current and former licensee stores 
previously  this segment had also included our investments in marketable securities which were liquidated during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our investment in the fortress value recovery fund i  llc fortress  which was fully impaired during the first quarter of fiscal  and our equity investment in ihfc sold during the second quarter of fiscal 
although this segment does not have operating earnings  income or loss from the segment is included in other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
our equity investment in ihfc was not included in the identifiable assets of this segment at november  since it had a negative book value and was therefore included in the long term liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet 
as more fully discussed under liquidity and capital resources below  our entire investment in ihfc was sold during the second quarter of resulting in a gain of  we own of zenith freight lines  llc zenith  which provides domestic transportation and warehousing services primarily to furniture manufacturers and distributors and also provides home delivery services to furniture retailers 
we have contracted with zenith to provide for substantially all of our domestic freight  transportation and warehousing needs for the wholesale business 
in addition  zenith provides home delivery services for several of our company owned retail stores 
we believe our partnership with zenith allows us to focus on our core competencies of manufacturing and marketing home furnishings 
zenith focuses on offering bassett customers best of class service and handling 
we consider the expertise that zenith exhibits in logistics to be a significant competitive advantage for us 
in addition  we believe that zenith is well positioned to take advantage of current growth opportunities for providing logistical services to the furniture industry 
at november  and november   our investment in zenith was  and  respectively 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we made an additional cash investment of  which represented our share of a total  equity contribution to zenith to partially fund its acquisition of a warehouse facility 
investment and real estate income loss and other items affecting net income loss for fiscal  and are as follows gain on sale of ihfc income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net income from continued dumping subsidy offset act gain on sale of equity securities other than temporary impairment of investments interest expense retail real estate impairment charges lease exit costs loan and lease guarantee expense recovery gain on mortgage settlements other total income see note to the consolidated financial statements for information related to our gain on the sale of ihfc as well as information related to our income from unconsolidated affiliated companies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information related to our income from the continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa 
represents the gain realized upon the completion of the liquidation of our portfolio of marketable equity securities during the first quarter of fiscal this liquidation had been initiated during fiscal represents the full impairment of our investment in fortress 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our interest expense consists primarily of interest on our retail real estate mortgage obligations 
this expense has been declining steadily as those obligations have been repaid 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to impairment charges and lease exit costs related to our retail real estate 
loan and lease guarantee expense consists of adjustments to our reserves for the net amount of our estimated losses on loan and lease guarantees that we have entered into on behalf of our licensees 
the recovery expense recognized for fiscal  and reflects the changes in our estimates of the additional risk that we may have to assume the underlying obligations with respect to our guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the gain on mortgage settlements during fiscal provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision benefit of   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
for fiscal  our effective tax rate of approximately differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to the reversal of the majority of the valuation allowance on existing deferred tax assets  resulting in a credit to income of  for fiscal  our effective tax rate of differed from the statutory rate of primarily due to our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits to significantly offset the taxable gain on the sale of our investment in ihfc  resulting in a benefit of  against our tax provision 
the benefit recognized in fiscal arose primarily as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations on unrecognized state tax benefits  partially offset by the accrual of income taxes to be paid in certain states and penalties associated with certain unrecognized tax benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our income tax provision benefit  as well as our net deferred tax assets and other matters 
with the release of the majority of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  we now have net deferred tax assets of  as of november   which  upon utilization  are expected to reduce our cash outlays for income taxes in future years 
it will require approximately  of future taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to withstand the current difficult industry conditions  to allow us to take advantage of opportunities as market conditions improve  and to execute our long term retail strategies 
with significant additional liquidity provided by the sale of our interest in ihfc  the final distribution of funds from the cdsoa  and the gradual recovery of our sales from the low point reached during the recession  we have strengthened our balance sheet and have begun to see a return to operating profitability 
furthermore  the vast majority of the stores that were operated by the licensees experiencing the most severe financial distress have since been taken over by us or closed  resulting in a remaining fleet of licensees which we believe to be considerably more financially sound 
sale of ihfc final distribution of cdsoa funds during the second quarter of fiscal  we received  representing our share of the final distribution of duties that had been withheld by us customs and border protection under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the cdsoa final distribution and claims that could possibly result in the return of some or all of this distribution 
on may   we completed the sale of our investment in ihfc  receiving cash proceeds of  upon closing and recording a gain of  during the first quarter of fiscal we received an additional  representing our share of the release of a tax indemnification escrow which had been withheld from proceeds at closing 
at november   we still carried a receivable in the amount of  representing a general indemnification escrow withheld at closing 
on december   we received  for the release of half of the general indemnification escrow  with the remainder  provided it is not used for contingencies  being due for release to us during currently  we have no reason to believe that any obligations will arise out of such contingencies and therefore expect that the escrowed funds  along with earnings thereon  will be released to us in their entirety as scheduled 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale of ihfc 
with the additional liquidity provided by these events  we have retired certain debt and other long term obligations  settled various closed stores and idle facilities obligations  resumed paying a quarterly dividend  began buying back stock and paid special dividends of per share and per share during fiscal  as well as regular and special dividends of and per share  respectively  during we will continue to evaluate appropriate uses of available cash which may include more of such items previously listed along with future working capital needs and investments in new or repositioned company owned stores 
cash flows cash provided by operations during fiscal was  compared to cash used in operations of  during fiscal  representing an improvement of  in cash flows from operations 
fiscal included  received from the final cdsoa distribution while no similar distributions were received during fiscal the remaining improvement of  represents improved operations  offset in part by planned investment in additional inventory associated with the launch of new products 
our overall cash position declined during fiscal by  offsetting the  of cash provided by operating activities was  of cash used in financing activities for the payment of regular and special dividends and for the repurchase of common stock 
cash used in investing activities of  included investments in property and equipment of  primarily related to our new store locations and the purchase of a new retail data processing system expected to become operational during the first half of fiscal  partially offset by net proceeds from the liquidation of our remaining portfolio of marketable securities  the release of previously escrowed funds from the sale of ihfc  and collections on our notes receivable 
see our consolidated statement of cash flows for additional information regarding our sources and uses of cash during fiscal  and with cash and cash equivalents of  on hand at november   we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the foreseeable future 
receivables and inventory we recorded of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during fiscal as compared to  during fiscal  reflecting improved credit positions with our current fleet of licensees 
over the six quarters ended with the second quarter of  we recorded  of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges 
the vast majority of these charges related to licensee stores that were closed or taken over 
during that time period  we terminated operating licenses covering stores as these licensees were struggling to meet their obligations to us 
of these stores  were closed and were acquired to be operated as company owned stores 
although future store closures and acquisitions are possible  we expect the pace to be significantly less than during that time period 
in addition  we believe the remaining fleet of licensees is more financially sound than those we terminated during that time period 
the bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges which we have experienced since the third quarter of have averaged approximately per quarter 
we believe that this average level of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges is more indicative of the expected trend of future charges 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accounts and notes receivable at november  and november  certain of our accounts and notes receivable are secured by the filing of security statements in accordance with the uniform commercial code and or real estate owned by the note holder and in some cases  personal guarantees by our licensees 
our practice has generally been to work with the store owner to run a going out of business sale and use any proceeds to fund the remaining receivable 
our success with these events has varied 
however  typically the amounts recovered have not been materially different from the carrying amount of the receivable 
consequently  we generally have not been required to record significant bad debt expenses upon the conclusion of the event 
our investment in inventory affects our liquidity in several different ways 
first  cash paid for raw materials  labor  and factory overhead for the manufacture or assembly of our domestic inventories is typically paid out well in advance of receiving cash from the sale of these inventories 
payments for our imported inventories are funded much further in advance of receiving cash from the sale of these inventories as compared to our domestically manufactured or assembled inventories 
the length of our import supply chain necessitates complex forecasting of future demand levels and is highly judgmental 
in economic downturns  the speed at which we can respond to decreasing demand is slowed  as we typically have imported inventory in shipment or being manufactured at any given time 
in addition  we may also have inventory commitments under purchase orders that have not begun the manufacturing process 
consequently  as inventories build temporarily during downturns or as we near new product roll outs  our liquidity is reduced as we have more cash invested in our products 
second  the availability under our revolving credit facility is impacted by changes in our inventory balances 
lastly  if we fail to respond to changes in consumer tastes quickly enough  inventories may build and decrease our liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the composition of our inventories as well as our reserves for excess quantities and obsolete items 
the activity in the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory by segment are as follows wholesale segment retail segment total balance at november  additions charged to expense write offs balance at november  additions charged to expense write offs balance at november  the increase in additions charged to expense for fiscal over is primarily related to reserves taken on discontinued products as new product offerings were rolled out during the second half of our estimates and assumptions used in the determination of our inventory reserves have been reasonably accurate in the past 
we did not make any significant changes to our methodology for determining inventory reserves in and do not anticipate that our methodology is reasonably likely to change in the future 
a plus or minus change in our inventory reserves would not have been material to our financial statements for the periods presented 
our annual inventory turnover rate and ending days supply on hand for the years ended november   november  and november  are as follows consolidated annual inventory turns ending days supply on hand wholesale segment annual inventory turns ending days supply on hand retail segment annual inventory turns ending days supply on hand on a consolidated basis and for the wholesale segment  the reduced inventory turnover rate and increased supply on hand for fiscal as compared to is primarily due to an investment in inventory for the hgtv initiative  timing of receipt of certain inventory from asia  planned increases to support other upholstery growth initiatives  and the increasing proportion of company owned bhf stores in the total store network of bhf stores were company owned at november  as compared with at november  
inventory sold by our wholesale segment to our retail segment remains on our consolidated balance sheet for a longer period of time 
at our retail segment  the turnover rate was consistent for fiscal as compared to  while the slight increase in days supply on hand is due in part to the acquisition of two company owned stores late in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decline in consolidated and wholesale inventory turns  along with the related increase in days supply on hand  for fiscal as compared to was largely related to our inventory reduction efforts in fiscal in response to the economic recession 
we had reduced inventories to such a low level as we entered fiscal that  as business began to recover  we experienced stock shortages which impeded our ability to serve our customers 
as a result  we began planned increases in inventory levels during the latter half of debt and other obligations on december   we entered into a new credit facility with our bank extending us a line of credit of up to  this new line is secured by our accounts receivable and inventory 
the new facility contains certain covenants requiring us to maintain certain key financial ratios 
we are in compliance with all covenants under the agreement and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
at november   we had  outstanding under standby letters of credit 
we have two mortgages totaling  outstanding as of november  we expect to satisfy the remaining mortgage obligations using cash flow from operations or our available cash on hand 
we lease land and buildings that are used in the operation of our company owned retail stores as well as in the operation of licensee owned stores 
we had obligations of  at november  for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year 
we also have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators 
remaining terns under these lease guarantees range from one to three years 
we were contingently liable under licensee lease obligation guarantees in the amount of  at november  dividends and share repurchases during fiscal  four quarterly dividends totaling  and two special dividends totaling  were paid to shareholders 
we also repurchased  shares of our stock for  the weighted average effect of these share repurchases was to increase our basic and diluted earnings per share in by and  respectively 
capital expenditures we currently anticipate that total capital expenditures for fiscal will be between  and  which will be used primarily for the build out of new stores  remodeling of existing company owned stores and the implementation of a new retail store enterprise system 
our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future may change depending on many factors  including but not limited to the overall performance of the new stores  our rate of growth  our operating results and any adjustments in our operating plan needed in response to industry conditions  competition or unexpected events 
we believe that our existing cash  together with cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
fair value measurements we account for items measured at fair value in accordance with asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asc s valuation techniques are based on observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
asc classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy level inputs quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level inputs instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers 
areas which involve significant fair value estimates in determining the amounts recognized in our financial statements and the level of inputs utilized are as follows note references refer to our consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report hierarchy level of utilized inputs financial statement note reference marketable securities level note investment in fortress level note acquisitions goodwill level note loan lease guarantees level note all other fair value estimates which are made for disclosure purposes only utilize level inputs see note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments we enter into contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the ordinary course of business see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and other commercial commitments and the fiscal year in which they are expected to be paid 
thereafter total post employment benefit obligations real estate notes payable other obligations commitments contractual advertising interest payable letters of credit operating leases lease guarantees purchase obligations total does not reflect a reduction for the impact of any company owned life insurance proceeds to be received 
currently  we have life insurance policies with net death benefits of  to provide funding for these obligations

see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the company is not a party to any long term supply contracts with respect to the purchase of raw materials or finished goods 
at the end of fiscal year  we had approximately  in open purchase orders  primarily for imported inventories  which are in the ordinary course of business 
lease guarantees relate to payments we would only be required to make in the event of default on the part of the guaranteed parties 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize stand by letters of credit in the procurement of certain goods in the normal course of business 
we lease land and buildings that are primarily used in the operation of bhf stores 
we have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators as part of our retail strategy 
we also have guaranteed loans of certain of our licensees to finance initial inventory packages for these stores 
see contractual obligations and commitments table above and note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this annual report on form k  for further discussion of operating leases  lease guarantees and loan guarantees  including descriptions of the terms of such commitments and methods used to mitigate risks associated with these arrangements 
contingencies we are involved in various claims and litigation as well as environmental matters  which arise in the normal course of business 
although the final outcome of these legal and environmental matters cannot be determined  based on the facts presently known  it is our opinion that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
in  our former vendor  colonial trading  inc colonial  filed a lawsuit against us alleging  among other things  breach of contract by the company after we cancelled orders for cribs following product recalls 
we filed counterclaims for breach of contract and warranty 
on august   a jury returned a verdict in favor of colonial and in october judgment was entered in the amount of  colonial s motion for attorney s fees is pending 
both bassett and colonial have appealed  with bassett seeking a new trial for damages for breach of express warranty  among other things  and colonial seeking  among other things  to treble its breach of contract damages 
we currently have sufficient reserves to cover the judgment amount 
see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding claims which could possibly result in the return of all or a portion of the cdsoa final distribution 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bassett furniture industries  incorporated and its majority owned subsidiaries for whom we have operating control 
in accordance with asc topic  we have evaluated our licensees and certain other entities to determine whether they are variable interest entities vies of which we are the primary beneficiary and thus would require consolidation in our financial statements 
to date we have concluded that none of our licensees nor any other of our counterparties represent vies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the buyer 
this generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent dealers or  in the case of company owned retail stores  upon delivery to the customer 
our payment terms generally vary from to days 
an estimate for returns and allowances has been provided in recorded sales 
the contracts with our licensee store owners do not provide for any royalty or license fee to be paid to us 
staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab outlines the four basic criteria for recognizing revenue as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sab further asserts that if collectibility of all or a portion of the revenue is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition should be deferred until payment is received 
during fiscal  and  there were zero  four and seven dealers  respectively  for which these criteria were not met and therefore revenue was being recognized on a cost recovery basis 
as of november  and november   two and four dealers  respectively  remained on the cost recovery basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our accounts receivable reserves were  and  at november  and november   respectively  representing and of our gross accounts receivable balances at those dates  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified customer accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables from our licensees and other customers on a quarterly basis based on factors such as their financial condition  our collateral position  potential future plans with licensees and other similar factors 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of potential losses on our accounts and notes receivable and is adjusted accordingly based on historical experience  current developments and present economic conditions and trends 
in the current economic environment  our historical experience with customers carries less weight than in previous years 
the timeliness of a licensee s or customer s ability to pay us can deteriorate at a much faster pace than in previous years 
as such  despite our best efforts  the ultimate precision with respect to our allowance for doubtful accounts is likely to be less when compared to previous periods 
although actual losses have not differed materially from our previous estimates  future losses could differ from our current estimates 
unforeseen events such as a licensee or customer bankruptcy filing could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we recorded of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges during fiscal as compared to  during fiscal  reflecting improved credit positions with our current fleet of licensees 
over the six quarters ended with the second quarter of  we recorded  of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges 
the vast majority of these charges related to licensee stores that were closed or taken over 
during that time period  we terminated operating licenses covering stores as these licensees were struggling to meet their obligations to us 
of these stores  were closed and were acquired to be operated as company owned stores 
although future store closures and acquisitions are possible  we expect the pace to be significantly less than during that time period 
in addition  we believe the remaining fleet of licensees is more financially sound than those we terminated during that time period 
the bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges which we have experienced since the third quarter of have averaged approximately per quarter 
we believe that this average level of bad debt and notes receivable valuation charges is more indicative of the expected trend of future charges 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined for domestic furniture inventories using the last in  first out method 
the cost of imported inventories is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our average annual write offs of excess and obsolete inventory over the past three fiscal years have not materially exceeded the average opening balance of our reserves for that same period 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets we evaluate our deferred income tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted 
a valuation allowance is established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of recent losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
due to the losses incurred prior to fiscal  we were in a cumulative loss position for the preceding three years which is considered significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome on a more likely than not standard through objectively verifiable data 
while our long term financial outlook remained positive  we concluded that our ability to rely on our long term outlook and forecasts as to future taxable income was limited due to uncertainty created by the weight of the negative evidence 
as a result  we previously recorded a valuation allowance on certain of the deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  due to the gain recognized on the sale of our interest in ihfc  we were able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and credits to significantly offset the taxable gain  resulting in a significant reduction of the valuation allowances 
however  as the gain on the sale of ihfc did not represent a source of recurring future taxable income  we continued to record a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax assets as of november  due to our positive earnings during fiscal  and the absence of any significant negative evidence to the contrary  we have concluded that we can rely on our positive long term outlook and forecasts as to future taxable income in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the reserve against the majority of our deferred tax assets was removed in fiscal  resulting in a credit to income of  which is included in our net income tax benefit for the year 
the remaining valuation allowance of is primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards for which it is currently considered to be more likely than not that they will not be utilized prior to their expiration 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
the acquisition of assets and liabilities and any resulting goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit  wholesale  retail or real estate investments 
we review goodwill at the reporting unit level annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill other  the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process  if necessary 
however  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in asc topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary and our goodwill is considered to be unimpaired 
however  if based on our qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we will proceed with performing the two step process 
the first step compares the carrying value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit 
should the carrying value of a reporting unit be in excess of the estimated fair value of that reporting unit  the second step is performed whereby we must calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
this second step represents a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if we had acquired the reporting unit on that date 
our impairment methodology uses a discounted cash flow analysis requiring certain assumptions and estimates to be made regarding future profitability of the reporting unit and industry economic factors 
while we believe such assumptions and estimates are reasonable  the actual results may differ materially from the projected amounts 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
when analyzing our real estate properties for potential impairment  we consider such qualitative factors as our experience in leasing and or selling real estate properties as well as specific site and local market characteristics 
upon the closure of a bassett home furnishings store  we generally write off all tenant improvements which are only suitable for use in such a store 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding the impact or potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements upon our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies 
substantially all of our imports purchased outside of north america are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  we believe that gains or losses resulting from changes in the value of foreign currencies relating to foreign purchases not denominated in us dollars would not be material to our results from operations in fiscal we are exposed to market risk from changes in the cost of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes  principally wood  woven fabric  and foam products 
a recovery in home construction could result in increases in wood and fabric costs from current levels  and the cost of foam products  which are petroleum based  is sensitive to changes in the price of oil 
we have potential exposure to market risk related to the current weakness in the commercial real estate market 
our retail real estate holdings of  and  at november  and november   respectively  for stores currently or formerly operated by licensees as well as our holdings of  and  at november  and november   respectively  for company owned stores could suffer significant impairment in value if we are forced to close additional stores and sell or lease the related properties in the current market 
additionally  if we are required to assume responsibility for payment under the lease obligations of  and  which we have guaranteed on behalf of licensees as of november  and november   respectively  we may not be able to secure sufficient sub lease income in the current market to offset the payments required under the guarantees
