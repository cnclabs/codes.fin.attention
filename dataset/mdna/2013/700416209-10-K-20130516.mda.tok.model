unless otherwise indicated in this discussion and analysis  all reference to years in this discussion and analysis are to the company s fiscal years and all annual information in this discussion and analysis is for such fiscal years 
the comparisons of the company results of operations for to the company results of operations for are impacted by the facts that the fiscal year consisted of weeks and the fiscal year consisted of weeks 
financial overview the company total net sales worldwide in were lower than in primarily as a result of lower sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in north america  asia and europe 
the company s sales of aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies were also slightly lower in than in the decline in sales of printed circuit materials products resulted in lower gross profit and lower earnings from operations in compared to however  the company s gross profit margin  measured as a percentage of sales  improved to in from in the company s earnings from operations and net earnings were lower in than in primarily as a result of the declines in the company s total net sales in compared to and due to the higher restructuring charges in related to the closures of the park advanced composite materials  inc pacm facility located in waterbury  connecticut and the nelco technology zhuhai ftz ltd 
nelco zhuhai facility located in the free trade zone in zhuhai  china 
the decline in sales and the restructuring charges in were partially offset by a small improvement in the company s gross profit margin  which resulted from the improved operating performance of the company s park aerospace technologies corp 
patc business unit in newton  kansas in and the cost reductions resulting from the closures of the company s pacm and nelco zhuhai facilities in the decline in sales and the restructuring charges in were also partially offset by the benefits from the higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials products in than in the  by lower selling  general and administrative expenses in than in and by the lower income tax expense in than in the company s net earnings in were adversely affected by the lower interest and other income realized by the company in than in litigation and insurance settlements in consisted of the company s recognition of pre tax other income of million in resulting from the settlement of a lawsuit for an insurance claim for business interruption at the company s neltec  inc business unit in tempe  arizona in caused by the explosion and resulting destruction of a treater at the company s business unit in singapore and the settlement of a lawsuit pertaining to defective equipment purchased by the company s patc business unit in newton  kansas 
the company s operating and earnings performances in both and were adversely affected by additional  and in some instances duplicative  costs associated with transferring aerospace composite materials manufacturing from the company s pacm facility in waterbury  connecticut to the company s patc facility in newton  kansas 
such costs were eliminated in third quarter of by the closure of the pacm facility 
the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products continue to be very difficult to forecast  and it is not clear to the company what the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products will be in or beyond 
further  the company is not able to predict the impact the current global economic and financial conditions will have on the markets for its aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies in or beyond 
in the second quarter of  the company s nelco zhuhai facility  located in the free trade zone in zhuhai  china  ceased its operations 
in connection with the closure of such facility  the company recorded approximately million of such charges in and expects to record no significant additional charges in connection with such closure 
the manufacturing activities conducted by nelco zhuhai are now conducted by nelco products pte 
ltd 
in singapore  and the cessation of operations of nelco zhuhai has not resulted in the loss of any business by the company 
the company is supplying and fully supporting all of its customers in asia from its nelco products pte 
ltd 
business unit in singapore 
in the third quarter of  the company completed a major expansion of its patc aerospace composite materials development and manufacturing facility in kansas in order to manufacture aerospace composite parts and assemblies in the same facility as advanced composite materials  which are used in the manufacture of such parts and assemblies 
the expansion consisted of approximately  square feet of manufacturing and storage space  and the company spent approximately million on the facility expansion and equipment 
following the expansion of patc  the company transferred the aerospace composite parts and assemblies manufacturing activities of its park aerospace structures corp 
pasc facility in lynnwood  washington to its patc facility and closed pasc in the fourth quarter of  and the company transferred pacm s aerospace composite materials manufacturing activities to the company s patc facility and closed pacm in the third quarter of the activities of pasc which were transferred to patc included the assets and business of nova composites  inc  which pasc acquired in april the transfer of aerospace composite materials manufacturing activities from the company s pacm facility to its patc facility and the transfer of aerospace composite parts and assemblies manufacturing activities from the company s pasc facility to its patc facility consolidated all of the company s north american aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies manufacturing activities  as well as all of its design and development activities for composite parts and assemblies at the patc facility 
the completion of the consolidation of the company s aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies manufacturing activities eliminated the additional  and in some cases duplicative  costs which the company had incurred in connection with the start up of patc and the transfer of such manufacturing activities from pacm and pasc to patc 
as the result of the closure of pacm  the company recorded pre tax charges of million in and pre tax charges of million in in connection with such closure 
the company does not expect to record significant additional charges in connection with such closure  and the pacm business operations will have no further impact on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company

net cash provided by operating activities   net cash provided by used in investing activities  net cash used in financing activities   cash and marketable securities of the million of cash and marketable securities at march   approximately million was owned by certain of the company s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
if such foreign owned cash were needed to fund the company s operations in the united states  the company would be required to accrue and pay federal and state income taxes in the united states on the amount of such cash that was repatriated to the united states 
however  it is the company s practice and current intent to indefinitely reinvest such cash owned by its foreign subsidiaries in the operations of its foreign subsidiaries or in other foreign activities  including acquisitions outside the united states 
the company has sufficient liquidity in the united states to fund its activities for the foreseeable future 
the change in cash and marketable securities at march  compared to february  was the result of cash provided by operating activities and a number of additional factors  including the following accounts receivable were higher at march  than at february  principally due to an increase in the number of days of sales in accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  other current assets were higher at march  than at february  primarily as a result of higher income tax refunds receivable  accounts payable decreased by at march  compared to february  primarily as a result of lower inventories in the fourth quarter of than in the fourth quarter of  accrued liabilities were lower at march  than at february  due primarily to lower employee benefits and lower restructuring accruals  and inventories decreased at march  compared to february  primarily due to decreases in the quantities of raw materials and finished goods inventories 
in addition  as described below  the company paid million in cash dividends during the fiscal year  including a special cash dividend of million paid in the fourth quarter of working capital the increase in working capital at march  compared to february  was due principally to the increases in cash and marketable securities  accounts receivable and other current assets and the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by the decrease in inventories

long term debt at march  the company had million of long term debt  and at february   the company had no long term debt 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a five year revolving credit facility agreement with pnc bank  national association 
the credit facility agreement provides for loans of up to million to the company and letters of credit up to million for the account of the company  and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  an interest rate on the outstanding loan balance of libor plus 
other interest rate options are available to the company under the credit agreement 
at the end of  the company borrowed million under this credit facility and used all of such borrowed funds to finance the payment of a special cash dividend of per share  totaling million  paid to its shareholders on february  the company incurred  of interest expense in the fourth quarter of under such credit agreement 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
other liquidity factors the company believes its financial resources will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to provide for continued investment in working capital and property  plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes 
such resources would also be available for purchases of the company common stock  appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company business 
the company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity 
contractual obligations the company contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as lease agreements  consist only of i operating lease commitments  commitments to purchase raw materials and commitments to purchase equipment  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and ii the long term debt described above 
the company has no other long term debt  capital lease obligations  unconditional purchase obligations or other long term obligations  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments  other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of million to secure the company obligations under its workers compensation insurance program 
as of march   the company s significant contractual obligations  including payments due by fiscal year  were as follows contractual obligations amounts in thousands total and thereafter operating lease obligations    long term debt   inventory purchase obligations   equipment purchase obligations total      at march   the company had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of million 
a reasonable estimate of timing of these liabilities is not possible 
off balance sheet arrangements the company liquidity is not dependent on the use of  and the company is not engaged in  any off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in  and  the company charged approximately   and  respectively  against pre tax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs and related legal fees 
the company expects to receive reimbursement pursuant to general liability insurance coverage for approximately  and  respectively  of such amounts charged in and while annual environmental remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures  including legal fees  have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at march  and february   there were no amounts recorded in accrued liabilities for environmental matters 
management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business  consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position of the company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for a discussion of the company contingencies  including those related to environmental matters 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following information is provided regarding critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that entail  to a significant extent  the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of management judgment 
general the company discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to sales allowances  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  restructurings  contingencies and litigation  and employee benefit programs 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
all material sales transactions are for the shipment of manufactured printed circuit materials products and advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies 
sales allowances the company provides for the estimated costs of sales allowances at the time such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company s products are made to customer specifications and tested for adherence to such specifications before shipment to customers 
composite parts and assemblies may be subject to airworthiness acceptance by customers after receipt at the customers locations 
there are no future performance requirements other than the products meeting the agreed specifications 
the company s bases for providing sales allowances for returns are known situations in which products may have failed due to manufacturing defects in the products supplied by the company 
the company is focused on manufacturing the highest quality printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies possible and employs stringent manufacturing process controls and works with raw material suppliers who have dedicated themselves to complying with the company s specifications and technical requirements 
the amounts of returns and allowances resulting from defective or damaged products have been approximately of sales for each of the company s last three fiscal years 
allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are due within established payment terms and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than established payment terms are considered past due 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
if the financial condition of the company customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions about future demand for the company products and market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  the company assesses the impairment of goodwill at least annually 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in the use of the company s assets or strategy of the overall business 
income taxes as part of the processes of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the carrying value of the company net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company consolidated statements of operations  or conversely to further reduce the existing valuation allowance resulting in less income tax expense 
the company evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when  in the company s judgment  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances and when new information becomes available 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
the effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by the company 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate 
interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense 
restructurings in the second quarter of  the company s nelco zhuhai facility  located in the free trade zone in zhuhai  china  ceased its operations 
in connection with the closure of such facility  the company recorded approximately million of such charges in and expects to record no significant additional charges in connection with such closure 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced that its pacm facility  located in waterbury  connecticut  would be closing its operations after the completion of the transfer of its aerospace composite materials manufacturing activities to the company s patc facility located at the newton  kansas airport 
such transfer and closure were completed in the third quarter of as the result of the closure of pacm  the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million in and million in the company does not expect to record significant additional charges in connection with such closure 
the company also recorded a pre tax charge of million in and a pre tax charge of million in related to the closure  in january of  of the operations of neltec europe sas  the company s electronic materials business unit located in mirebeau  france 
the company previously recorded a pre tax charge of million in connection with such closure in the fourth quarter of the additional charge in was based on updated estimates of the total costs to complete the closure of the neltec europe sas business unit as a result of additional information regarding such costs  including recent developments relating to certain employment litigation initiated in france after the closure and other expenses in excess of the original estimates 
the closure of neltec europe sas in january of was a major component of restructurings of the operations of the company s neltec europe sas and neltec sa business units in such restructurings and workforce reductions are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report and elsewhere in this discussion 
contingencies and litigation the company is subject to a number of proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  employment  product and other matters
