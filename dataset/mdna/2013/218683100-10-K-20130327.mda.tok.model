table of contents income taxes management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized

management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s relationships with its two largest customers navistar and paccar  and any recent customer diversification efforts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk core molding technologies primary market risk results from changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations 
core molding technologies is also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations associated with the mexican peso 
core molding technologies does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
core molding technologies has the following five items that are sensitive to market risks industrial development revenue bond idrb with a variable interest rate although the company has an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at  revolving line of credit  mexican expansion revolving loan and mexican loan payable under the credit agreement  each of which bears a variable interest rate  capex loan payable with a variable interest rate although the company has an interest rate swap to fix the variable portion of the applicable interest rate at  foreign currency purchases in which the company purchases mexican pesos with united states dollars to meet certain obligations that arise due to operations at the facility located in mexico  and raw material purchases in which core molding technologies purchases various resins and fiberglass for use in production 
the prices and availability of these materials are affected by the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as processing capacity versus demand 
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  core molding technologies would be impacted by an increase in raw material costs  which would have an adverse effect on operating margins 
assuming a hypothetical change in short term interest rates  interest paid on the company s line of credit  mexican expansion revolving loan and the mexican loan would impact the interest paid by the company  as the interest rate on these loans is based upon libor  however  it would not have a material effect on earnings before taxes 
a change in future interest rate curves would impact the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps
