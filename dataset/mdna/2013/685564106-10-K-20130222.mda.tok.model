readers should be cautioned that a number of important factors  including those identified above in item special note regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors  may affect actual results and may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward looking statement 
our historical results of operations may not be indicative of our future operating results 
overview introduction orbital sciences corporation develops and manufactures small and medium class rockets and space systems for commercial  military and civil government customers 
our primary products and services include the following launch vehicles rockets that are used as small and medium class space launch vehicles that place satellites into earth orbit and escape trajectories  interceptor and target vehicles for missile defense systems and suborbital launch vehicles that place payloads into a variety of high altitude trajectories 
satellites and space systems small and medium class satellites that are used to enable global and regional communications and broadcasting  conduct space related scientific research  collect imagery and other remotely sensed data about the earth  carry out interplanetary and other deep space exploration missions  and demonstrate new space technologies 
advanced space programs human rated space systems for earth orbit and deep space exploration  and small and medium class satellites primarily used for national security space programs and to demonstrate new space technologies 
our general strategy is to develop and expand a core integrated business of space and launch system technologies and products  focusing on the design and manufacture of affordable rockets  satellites and other space systems in order to establish and expand positions in niche markets that have not typically been emphasized by our larger competitors 
another part of our strategy is to seek customer contracts that will fund new product development and enhancements to our existing launch vehicle and space systems product lines 
as a result of our capabilities and experience in designing  developing  manufacturing and operating a broad range of small and medium class rockets and space systems  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the demand for more affordable space technology systems in commercial satellite communications  space based military and intelligence operations and military defense programs  and to take 
table of contents advantage of government sponsored initiatives in human space exploration  space based scientific research and interplanetary exploration 
business and industry considerations us government business during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were derived from contracts with the us government and its agencies or from subcontracts with other us government contractors 
most of our us government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis 
as a result  our operations and our financial results in any period could be impacted substantially by trends in us government spending  shifting priorities in dod including mda  nasa and other agency budgets  the types of contracts and payment terms mandated by the us government and changes in the executive branch and congress 
these factors  which are largely beyond our control  could have a significant impact on our business 
the budget control act of commits the us government to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years through caps on discretionary spending and other measures  including automatic across the board spending cuts through the sequestration process  if necessary 
although congress has delayed sequestration temporarily  without further action  it will take effect on march  it remains uncertain whether the contemplated sequester will take place  or if it will be delayed  modified or averted 
in general  we expect that our us government customers will experience reductions in their budgets compared to recent levels 
such reductions could occur even if a compromise is reached on us government spending and sequestration is averted 
nasa continues to prioritize funding for development of us commercial cargo and crew services for the international space station 
accordingly  funding for our cots demonstration mission  including an antares test launch  and our crs contract currently remains unaffected by budget cuts 
priorities with respect to earth and space science investigations are less clear  but we believe the nasa budget for these programs could be reduced as a result of a focus on other programs  which could have a negative impact on certain of our current programs or potential future pursuits 
the majority of orbital missile defense interceptor and target launch vehicle revenues comes from programs sponsored by mda 
the budget control act of provides for a significant reduction in defense budgets over a ten year period  with further reductions possible in the event of sequestration 
consequently  we expect federal spending on space and missile defense programs to be lower compared to historical levels over the next couple of years 
due to uncertainties regarding funding and federal budgets  we believe certain mda programs could be delayed or reduced in scope 
we believe that federal budget constraints may impact national security space programs  possibly resulting in program delays  cancellations or scope reductions 
dod and the intelligence community have for some missions historically relied on large multi mission space systems that are very expensive and require a decade or longer to be built and deployed 
we believe that dod and the intelligence community are considering ways to address their 
table of contents operational requirements on more limited budgets by considering smaller and more affordable space systems that we believe are within our addressable market  however  it is uncertain whether we will achieve any competitive advantages as a result 
commercial satellites business our largest commercial business is the design and manufacture of small class geo communications satellites 
commercial communications satellites accounted for  and of our consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
the commercial communications satellite market is driven by economic conditions that may affect satellite operators directly as well as their satellite replacement requirements 
in  the total number of commercial geo satellite orders was similar to the number ordered in  as the largest satellite operators continued their trend of reduced capital spending  following greater expenditures in prior years 
we expect capital spending from the major satellite operators to remain at similarly low levels in the near future 
as a result  we expect that the total number of commercial geo satellite orders placed in  including the number of satellite orders in our addressable market  will be comparable to those of and critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences may be material 
the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future revenues  costs and profit is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management assumptions regarding our future operational performance as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract revenue  cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated costs to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed  performance based milestones are not achieved or 
table of contents progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and operating profit from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
many of our contracts include provisions that increase or decrease contract value based on performance in relation to established targets or customer evaluations 
mission success milestones and incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue when we are able to make reasonable predictions about whether the performance targets will be achieved and make dependable estimates of such amounts based upon our historical experience with similar types of activities and other objective criteria 
we include the estimated amount of mission success milestones and incentive and award fees in estimated contract revenue at the inception of each contract  with reassessments made each quarter throughout the period of contract performance 
if performance under such contracts were to differ from previous assumptions  or if we were to revise our estimates or assumptions  current period revenues and profit would be adjusted and could fluctuate significantly 
our assessments are guided by the historical performance of our products and product families  the reliability record of the technology employed and assessments of technological considerations for each contract 
as part of our risk management strategy  we generally insure significant mission success milestone receipts 
insurance recoveries are recorded as other income in the consolidated financial statements 
mission success milestones relating to the launch of our antares rocket with its cygnus payload and the successful delivery of cargo to the iss comprise approximately of total crs contract value 
if we do not achieve these mission success milestones  we may be required to record revenue and profit reductions 
since the inception of the crs contract in december through december   we have recognized million of revenues on the contract  which has a total contract value of approximately billion 
as of december   unbilled receivables included approximately million of incentive fees on certain completed satellite contracts that become due incrementally over periods of up to years  subject to the achievement of performance criteria 
certain satellite contracts require the company to refund a portion of the contract price to the customer if performance criteria  which cover periods of up to years  are not satisfied 
as of december   we could be required to refund up to approximately million to customers if certain completed satellites were to fail to satisfy performance criteria 
we generally procure insurance policies under which we believe we would recover satellite incentive fees that are not earned and potential performance refund obligations 
research and development expenditures for company sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred 
research and development projects performed under contracts for customers are recorded as contract costs 
in  we entered into the cots agreement with nasa to design  build and demonstrate a new space transportation system for delivering cargo and supplies to the iss 
the cots agreement is accounted for as a best efforts 
table of contents research and development cost sharing arrangement 
as such  the amounts funded by nasa are recognized proportionally as an offset to our cots program research and development expenses  including associated general and administrative expenses 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances

research and development expenses our research and development expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in  an million increase compared to million  or of revenues  in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to product enhancements in the satellites and space systems segment and increased costs pertaining to the antares launch vehicle development program 
these factors 
table of contents were partially offset by lower cots program costs as this program was nearing completion in late the large majority of our research and development expenses in and were attributable to the cots and the antares development programs 
the cots program is accounted for as a best efforts research and development cost sharing arrangement 
as such  the amounts funded by nasa are recognized proportionally as an offset to the company cots program research and development expenses  including associated general and administrative expenses 
under the cots agreement  as amended  as of december   nasa has agreed to pay us million in cash milestone payments  partially funding our program costs which are currently estimated to be approximately million

through december  the company has received million in cash from nasa and as of december   the company recorded an approximately million receivable due from nasa 
research and development expenses attributable to our antares launch vehicle development program were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we believe that the majority of our research and development expenses are recoverable and billable under our contracts with the us government 
charging practices relating to research and development and other costs that may be charged directly or indirectly to government contracts are subject to audit by us government agencies to determine if such costs are reasonable and allowable under government contracting regulations and accounting practices

since the inception of the antares program through december   we have incurred million of such costs 
if such costs were determined to be unallowable  we could be required to record revenue and profit reductions in future periods 
in  we established a self imposed ceiling on the amount of research and development expenses that we would recover under our us government contracts 
although we believe that such expenses would otherwise have been allowable and recoverable under government contracting regulations and accounting practices  in  we incurred million of research and development costs in excess of our self imposed ceiling for which we did not seek recovery under our us government contracts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposure is primarily related to the market value of certain investments that we hold as of december   changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risk 
we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
investments as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k  we currently hold investments in certain auction rate and preferred stock securities that experienced a decline in fair value that resulted in our recording certain other than temporary impairment charges in periods prior to we may be required to record additional impairment charges if there are further reductions in the fair value of these investments in future periods

at december   we had million of receivables denominated in euros and million of receivables denominated in japanese yen
