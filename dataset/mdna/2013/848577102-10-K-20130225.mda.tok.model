item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
year in review the year proved to be one of the most successful years on record for the company 
we reported profitability for the sixth consecutive year  earning million per share  diluted  compared to net income of million per share  diluted in our continuous effort to preserve our low cost structure and to offer separately a range of optional services allowed us to offer low base fares which drove strong customer demand during in addition  our ability to adjust our capacity and routes in response to changing market conditions allowed us to increase our profitability year over year 
we achieved a operating profit margin on billion in operating revenues  despite an estimated million in lost revenues caused by operational disruptions related to hurricane sandy 
our traffic grew by as we continued to stimulate demand with low fares  evidenced by our ability to reduce our average ticket revenue per passenger flight segment by or to 
in addition to the effect of the storm during  we also experienced increases in energy prices as well as additional maintenance costs as a result of our seat maintenance program 
our fuel expense increased million  or  to million during as compared to mainly as a result of our increased flight volume of coupled with increases in fuel cost per gallon of year over year 
during  we introduced and completed a new seat maintenance program which added million in one time start up costs to maintenance expenses 
our operating cost structure has been a primary area of focus since  when we decided to compete solely on the basis of fare price and implemented our ulcc business model 
spirit unit operating costs continue to be among the lowest of any airline in the americas 
during  we expanded our fleet of airbus single aisle aircraft from to our high density seating configuration allows us to be the greenest major airline in the united states  because we burn less fuel per passenger than our competitors 
we grew our capacity in by  expanding into five new destinations phoenix mesa  arizona  denver  colorado  houston  texas  minneapolis st 
paul  minnesota  and los cabos  mexico 
in  we announced the opening of crew and maintenance bases in las vegas  nevada and in dallas fort worth  texas to help support the expansion of our operation to destinations in the western united states  and drive overall lower operating costs 
driving increased ancillary revenue also continues to be a primary focus 
in  we increased our average non ticket revenue per passenger flight segment by  or  to 
our total non ticket revenue increased by  or million  to million in in late  we increased our domestic passenger usage fee  while decreasing many of the corresponding base fares  which drove much of the increase in non ticket revenue per passenger segment and the decrease in ticket revenue per passenger segment in in addition  we restructured our bag charges in an effort to encourage customers to pre pay for bags on the website rather than at the airport or the gate 
we also continued to grow non ticket revenues by offering travel related options such as hotels and rental cars for sale through our website  through our fare club  and other options to enhance our customers travel experience 
during  our unit operating costs excluding fuel and special charges credits adjusted casm excluding fuel increased by to cents 
the increase on a per unit basis is primarily due to increases in maintenance costs  depreciation and amortization  and certain costs within other operating expenses 
the increase in maintenance costs is due primarily to the one time start up costs of our seat maintenance program 
the increase in depreciation and amortization is related to the increase in scheduled heavy maintenance events on our aircraft 
we use the deferral method of accounting for scheduled heavy maintenance checks  and therefore  once the event is performed  we capitalize the associated costs and amortize the expense over time until the earlier of the end of the remaining lease term or until the next scheduled heavy maintenance event 
many of the markets we added in  as well as the run rate effect of those added during  have higher average operating costs which  in addition to contributing to increases in other rents and landing fees  drove increases in station related costs that are accounted for under other operating expenses 
in addition  prior to our crew base openings in las vegas  nevada and dallas  texas in  our network scope changes drove higher crew related expenses as result of increased hotel volumes at higher average rates 
we also experienced higher passenger re accommodation expenses associated with flight cancellations during on december  we signed a new agreement with airbus for the delivery of airbus a aircraft 
as of december   our firm order with airbus including under our old purchase agreement and a third party consisted of a family aircraft scheduled for delivery through our plan calls for growing the fleet by in ipo on june   we completed our initial public offering of common stock  or ipo  which raised net proceeds of million after repayment of debt  payment of transaction expenses and other fees 
in connection with the ipo  we effected a recapitalization  which we refer to as the recapitalization  that resulted in the repayment or conversion of all of our notes and shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock 
pilot strike on may   the nmb released us and the pilots union from mandatory supervised mediation  which commenced a day cooling off period as provided in the rla 
on june   following several negotiation sessions with the pilots union during the cooling off period that did not result in an agreement  our pilots declared a strike  and we were forced to suspend all flight operations 
the parties reached a tentative agreement on june  under a return to work agreement  and a full flight schedule was resumed on june  on july   the pilots ratified a five year collective bargaining agreement that became effective on august  the results of operations for were materially adversely affected by the pilot strike 
the pilot strike resulted in reduced bookings in the period leading up to the strike as our customers became aware of the impending end of the cooling off period  and lost revenues while flight operations were shut down and while we recovered from the strike 
we also experienced additional expenses related to the strike  including costs to reaccommodate passengers  offset by reduced variable expenses  such as reduced fuel consumption and employee costs for flights not operated 
we estimate that the strike had a net negative impact on our operating income for of approximately million  resulting from an estimated million in lost revenues and approximately million of incremental costs  offset in part by a reduction of variable expenses during the strike of approximately million for flights not flown 
the strike resulted in a reduction of approximately million asms from our scheduled flying that was suspended during the five day strike period 
additionally  under the terms of the pilot contract  we also paid million in return to work payments during the second quarter of  which are not included in the strike impact costs described above 
the agreement with our pilots increased our pilot labor costs by approximately in compared to the estimated cost of the previous collective bargaining agreement and includes additional pay rate increases and modified work rules  which will increase the productivity of our pilots 
we believe the five year term is valuable in providing stability to our labor costs  and that the other terms will also provide us with competitive pilot labor costs compared to other us based low cost carriers 
our operating revenues our operating revenues are comprised of passenger revenues and non ticket revenues 
passenger revenues 
passenger revenues consist of the base fares that customers pay for air travel  which fares include government imposed taxes and fees 
non ticket revenues 
non ticket revenues are generated from air travel related charges for baggage  bookings through our distribution channels  advance seat selection  itinerary changes  hotel travel packages  and loyalty programs such as our free spirit affinity credit card program and fare club 
non ticket revenues also include revenues derived from services not directly related to providing transportation such as the sale of advertising to third parties on our website and on board our aircraft 
substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
passenger revenues are recognized once the related flight departs 
accordingly  the value of tickets sold in advance of travel is included under our current liabilities as air traffic liability  or atl  until the related air travel is provided 
non ticket revenues are generally recognized at the time the ancillary products are purchased or ancillary services are provided 
non ticket revenues also include revenues from our subscription based fare club  which we recognize on a straight line basis over months 
revenue is generated from the free spirit credit card affinity program through the sale of free spirit miles  card acquisitions  ongoing use of the free spirit credit cards  milestone payments in connection with the achievement of specific usage and user volumes  and renewals  which we currently recognize in accordance with the criteria as set forth in accounting standards update asu no 
please see critical accounting policies and estimates frequent flier program 
we recognize revenues net of certain taxes and airport passenger fees  which are collected by us on behalf of airports and governmental agencies and remitted to the applicable governmental entity or airport on a periodic basis 
these taxes and fees include us federal transportation taxes  federal security charges  airport passenger facility charges  and foreign arrival and departure taxes 
these items are collected from customers at the time they purchase their tickets  but are not included in our revenues 
we record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency or airport 
our operating expenses our operating expenses consist of the following line items 
aircraft fuel 
aircraft fuel expense is our single largest operating expense 
it includes the cost of jet fuel  related federal taxes  fueling into plane fees and transportation fees 
it also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from any fuel price hedging activity 
salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits expense includes the salaries  hourly wages  bonuses and equity compensation paid to employees for their services  as well as the related expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes 
aircraft rent 
aircraft rent expense consists of monthly lease rents for aircraft and spare engines under the terms of the related operating leases and is recognized on a straight line basis 
aircraft rent expense also includes that portion of maintenance reserves  also referred to as supplemental rent  paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities that is not probable of being reimbursed to us by the lessor 
to the extent we had any return condition obligations which we believe are probable  those would be considered contingent rent and would be included within aircraft rent expense 
aircraft rent expense is net of the amortization of gains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions on our flight equipment 
presently  all of our aircraft and spare engines are financed under operating leases 
landing fees and other rents 
landing fees and other rents include both fixed and variable facilities expenses  such as the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities  overfly fees paid to other countries and the monthly rent paid for our headquarters facility 
distribution 
distribution expense includes all of our direct costs to sell  including the cost of web support  our third party call center  travel agent commissions and related gds fees  and credit card transaction fees  associated with the sale of our tickets and other products and services 
maintenance  materials and repairs 
maintenance  materials and repairs expense includes all parts  materials  repairs and fees for repairs performed by third party vendors directly required to maintain our fleet 
it excludes direct labor cost related to our own mechanics  which is included under salaries  wages and benefits 
it also excludes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses  which we defer under the deferral method of accounting and amortize on a straight line or usage basis until the next estimated overhaul event 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of fixed assets we own and leasehold improvements 
it also includes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses we defer under the deferral method of accounting for heavy maintenance events and recognize into expense on a straight line or usage basis until the next overhaul event 
loss on disposal of assets 
loss on disposal of assets includes the net losses on the disposal of our fixed assets  including losses on sale and leaseback transactions 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses include airport operations expense and fees charged by third party vendors for ground handling services and food and liquor supply service expenses  passenger re accommodation expense  the cost of passenger liability and aircraft hull insurance  all other insurance policies except for employee health insurance  travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel  professional fees  personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses 
no individual item included in this category represented more than of our total operating expenses 
special charges credits 
special charges credits include termination costs  restructuring costs  secondary offering costs  and the gain on the sale of take off and landing slots 
in june  we transferred four permanent air carrier slots at ronald reagan national airport dca to another airline for million 
due to faa regulations  the gain of million was fully deferred at the time of the sale 
the company recognized the million gain within special charges credits in the third quarter of  the period in which the faa operating restriction lapsed and written confirmation of the slot transfer was received by the buyer from the faa 
on july   certain stockholders affiliated with oaktree capital management oaktree sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering 
the company incurred a total of million in costs during the year ended december  related to this offering 
upon completion of this secondary offering  investment funds affiliated with oaktree owned no shares of our common stock 
previously  on january   certain stockholders of the company  including affiliates of oaktree and indigo partners  llc indigo and certain members of the company executive team  sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering 
the company incurred a total of million in costs between and related to this secondary offering  offset by reimbursements from certain selling shareholders of million in accordance with the fourth amendment to the second amended and restated investor rights agreement 
the company did not receive any proceeds from either of these secondary offerings 
in the second quarter of  we incurred million of termination costs in connection with the ipo comprised of amounts paid to indigo to terminate its professional services agreement with us and fees paid to three individual  unaffiliated holders of our subordinated notes 
our other expense income interest expense 
paid in kind interest on notes due to related parties and preferred stock dividends due to related parties account  on average  for over of interest expense incurred for the years and non related party interest expense accounted for the remainder of interest expense in these periods 
all of the notes and preferred stock were repaid or redeemed  or exchanged for common stock  in connection with the recapitalization 
interest expense in primarily relates to interest on pre delivery deposits 
capitalized interest 
capitalized interest represents interest cost to finance purchase deposits for future aircraft and the opportunity cost interest incurred during the acquisition period of an aircraft that theoretically could have been avoided had we not made pdps for that aircraft 
these amounts are recorded as part of the cost of the aircraft upon delivery 
capitalization of interest ceases when the asset is ready for service 
our income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and available tax loss and credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in evaluating the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
immediately prior to the ipo  we entered into the tax receivable agreement and thereby distributed to the pre ipo stockholders the right to receive such stockholders pro rata share of the future payments to be made by us under the tax receivable agreement 
under the tax receivable agreement  we are obligated to pay to the pre ipo stockholders an amount equal to of the cash savings in federal income tax realized by us by virtue of our future use of the federal net operating loss  deferred interest deductions and alternative minimum tax credits held by us as of march   which we refer to as the pre ipo nol 
deferred interest deductions means interest deductions that have accrued as of march   but have been deferred under rules applicable to related party debt 
cash tax savings generally will be computed by comparing our actual federal income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had such pre ipo nols not been available to us 
upon consummation of the ipo and execution of the tra  the company recorded a liability with an offsetting reduction to additional paid in capital 
the term of the tra will continue until the first to occur of a the full payment of all amounts required under the agreement with respect to utilization or expiration of all of the pre ipo nols  b the end of the taxable year including the tenth anniversary of the ipo or c a change in control of the company 
the amount and timing of payments under the tra will depend upon a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the amount and timing of taxable income generated in the future and any future limitations that may be imposed on the company ability to use the pre ipo nols 
the company paid million  or of the tax savings realized from the utilization of nols in  including million of applicable interest in related to the tra 
as of december  an estimated remaining cash benefit of million is expected to be paid in to our pre ipo stockholders under the terms of the tra 
trends and uncertainties affecting our business we believe our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that affect airlines and their markets  trends affecting the broader travel industry  and trends affecting the specific markets and customer base that we target 
the following key factors may affect our future performance 
competition 
the airline industry is highly competitive 
the principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing  total price  flight schedules  aircraft type  passenger amenities  number of routes served from a city  customer service  safety record and reputation  code sharing relationships  and frequent flier programs and redemption opportunities 
price competition occurs on a market by market basis through price discounts  changes in pricing structures  fare matching  target promotions and frequent flier initiatives 
airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods to generate cash flow and to maximize unit revenue 
the prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity that it is under financial pressure to sell 
seasonality and volatility 
our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because the air transportation business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
we generally expect demand to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year 
the air transportation business is also volatile and highly affected by economic cycles and trends 
consumer confidence and discretionary spending  fear of terrorism or war  weakening economic conditions  fare initiatives  fluctuations in fuel prices  labor actions  changed in governmental regulations on taxes and fees  weather and other factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in revenues and results of operations in the past 
we believe demand for business travel historically has been more sensitive to economic pressures than demand for low price travel 
finally  a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in markets such as south florida  the caribbean  latin america and the northeast and northern midwest regions of the united states  which are particularly vulnerable to weather  airport traffic constraints and other delays 
aircraft fuel 
fuel costs represent the single largest operating expense for most airlines  including ours 
fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations in recent years 
fuel availability and pricing are also subject to refining capacity  periods of market surplus and shortage  and demand for heating oil  gasoline and other petroleum products  as well as meteorological  economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world  which we can neither control nor accurately predict 
we source a significant portion of our fuel from refining resources located in the southeast united states  particularly facilities adjacent to the gulf of mexico 
gulf coast fuel is subject to volatility and supply disruptions  particularly in hurricane season when refinery shutdowns have occurred in recent years  or when the threat of weather related disruptions has caused gulf coast fuel prices to spike above other regional sources 
from time to time  we use fuel hedges using nymex wti and us gulf coast jet fuel collars as the underlying commodity to attempt to mitigate price volatility 
additionally  during peak hurricane season august through october  we may enter into jet fuel swaps to protect the refining price risk between the price of crude oil and the price of refined jet fuel 
historically  we have protected approximately of our forecasted fuel requirements during peak hurricane season using jet fuel swaps 
our fuel hedging practices are dependent upon many factors  including our assessment of market conditions for fuel  our access to the capital necessary to support margin requirements  the pricing of hedges and other derivative products in the market and applicable regulatory policies 
as of december   the company had agreements in place to protect million gallons or approximately of its anticipated fuel consumption 
as of december   we purchased all of our aircraft fuel under a single fuel service contract 
the cost and future availability of jet fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
labor 
the airline industry is heavily unionized 
the wages  benefits and work rules of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements  or cbas 
relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the rla 
under the rla  cbas generally contain amendable dates rather than expiration dates  and the rla requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the nmb 
this process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new cba  or the parties have been released to self help by the nmb 
in most circumstances  the rla prohibits strikes  however  after release by the nmb  carriers and unions are free to engage in self help measures such as strikes and lockouts 
we have three union represented employee groups comprising approximately of our employees at december  our pilots are represented by the airline pilots association  international  or alpa  our flight attendants are represented by the association of flight attendants  or afa cwa  and our flight dispatchers are represented by the transport workers union of america  or twu 
conflicts between airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages 
in june  we experienced a five day strike by our pilots  which caused us to shut down our flight operations 
the strike ended as a result of our reaching a tentative agreement under a return to work agreement and a full flight schedule was resumed on june  on august   we entered into a five year collective bargaining agreement 
we believe the five year term is valuable in providing stability to our labor costs  and that the other terms will also provide us with competitive pilot labor costs compared to other us based low cost carriers 
in addition  our cba with our flight attendants became amendable under the rla in  and we are currently engaged in negotiations with the afa cwa 
the outcome of our collective bargaining negotiations cannot presently be determined and the terms and conditions of our future cbas may be affected by the results of collective bargaining negotiations at other airlines that may have a greater ability to bear higher costs under their business models 
if we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their cbas  we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages  such as the strike by our pilots in june a strike or other significant labor dispute with our unionized employees is likely to adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
maintenance expense 
maintenance expense grew through  and mainly as a result of the increasing age of our fleet approximately years on average at december  and growing fleet 
as the fleet ages  we expect that maintenance costs will increase in absolute terms 
the amount of total maintenance costs and related amortization of heavy maintenance expense is subject to many variables such as future utilization rates  average stage length  the size and makeup of the fleet in future periods and the level of unscheduled maintenance events and their actual costs 
accordingly  we cannot reliably quantify future maintenance expenses for any significant period of time 
however  we believe  based on our scheduled maintenance events  current maintenance expense and maintenance related amortization expense in will be approximately million 
as a result of a significant portion of our fleet being acquired over a relatively short period of time  significant maintenance scheduled on each of our planes will occur at roughly the same time  meaning we will incur our most expensive scheduled maintenance obligations across our current fleet around the same time 
these more significant maintenance activities will result in out of service periods during which our aircraft will be dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable to fly revenue service 
in addition  management expects that the final heavy maintenance events will be amortized over the remaining lease term rather than until the next estimated heavy maintenance event  because we account for heavy maintenance under the deferral method 
please see critical accounting policies and estimates aircraft maintenance  materials  repair costs and related heavy maintenance amortization 
this will result in significantly higher depreciation and amortization expense related to heavy maintenance 
maintenance reserve obligations 
the terms of some of our aircraft lease agreements require us to pay supplemental rent  also known as maintenance reserves  to the lessor in advance of and as collateral for the performance of major maintenance events  resulting in our recording significant prepaid deposits on our balance sheet 
as a result  the cash costs of scheduled major maintenance events are paid well in advance of the recognition of the maintenance event in our results of operations 
please see critical accounting policies and estimates aircraft maintenance  materials  repair costs and related heavy maintenance amortization and maintenance reserves 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
note to our financial statements provides a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments or estimates about matters that are both inherently uncertain and material to our financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition 
revenues from tickets sold are initially deferred as atl 
passenger revenues are recognized when transportation is provided 
an unused non refundable ticket expires at the date of scheduled travel and is recognized as revenue for the expired ticket value at the date of scheduled travel 
our most significant non ticket revenues include revenues generated from air travel related services paid for baggage  bookings through our call center or third party vendors  advance seat selection  itinerary changes and loyalty programs  and are recognized at the time products are purchased or ancillary services are provided 
these revenues also include commissions from the sales of hotel rooms  trip insurance and rental cars recognized at the time the service is rendered 
customers may elect to change their itinerary prior to the date of departure 
a service charge is assessed and recognized on the date the change is initiated and is deducted from the face value of the original purchase price of the ticket  and the original ticket becomes invalid 
the amount remaining after deducting the service charge is called a credit shell which expires days from the date the credit shell is created and can be used towards the purchase of a new ticket and the company s other service offerings 
the amount of credits expected to expire is recognized as revenue upon issuance of the credit and is estimated based on historical experience 
estimating the amount of credits that will go unused involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
non ticket revenues include revenues from our subscription based fare club  recognized on a straight line basis over months 
revenues generated from the sale of free spirit miles and credit card renewals are currently recognized on a straight line basis over months based on expected customer usage of miles 
we make assumptions on the future use of customer miles based on historical customer behavior 
to the extent that customer behavior changes as a result of  among other factors  economic conditions  perception of travel  and the number of miles to earn awards  a corresponding adjustment would be made to the period in which we recognize revenue generated from the free spirit miles and credit card renewals  resulting in either a smaller or larger liability 
also included in non ticket revenues are milestone payments in connection with the achievement of specific usage and user volumes  which we recognize when received from the free spirit credit card provider 
frequent flier program 
we accrue for mileage credits earned through travel  including mileage credits for members with an insufficient number of mileage credits to earn an award  under our free spirit program based on the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel for credits that are expected to be redeemed 
incremental costs include fuel  insurance  security  ticketing and facility charges reduced by an estimate of amounts required to be paid by the passenger when redeeming the award 
we also sell mileage credits to companies participating in the free spirit program or affinity card program 
under our original affinity card program  funds received from the sale of mileage credits were accounted for as a multiple element arrangement and allocated to a marketing component and a transportation component mileage credits using the residual method 
the fair value of the transportation component was deferred and recognized ratably as passenger revenue over the estimated period the transportation was expected to be provided 
the difference between the funds received and the fair value of the transportation component was recognized in non ticket revenue at the time of sale as non ticket marketing revenue 
the marketing component represented our compensation for  among many items  use of our trademark  customer lists and placement of marketing materials to encourage application for credit cards 
because there were no undelivered elements other than the mileage credits  we recorded the revenue from the marketing component when funds were received 
we also received bonuses from companies participating in the free spirit program that are driven by the volume of the usage of our co branded credit cards 
we recognized these bonuses as non ticket revenue when payment is received milestone method as the milestones were substantive 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined not to renew its agreement with the administrator of the free spirit affinity credit card program at the scheduled expiration in february we entered into a new affinity card program that became effective april  for the marketing of a co branded spirit credit card and the delivery of award miles over a five year period 
at the inception of the arrangement  we evaluated all deliverables in the arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
we determined the arrangement had three separate units of accounting i travel miles to be awarded  ii licensing of brand and access to member lists  and iii advertising and marketing efforts 
at inception of the arrangement  we established the relative selling price for all deliverables that qualified for separation  as arrangement consideration should be allocated based on relative selling price 
the manner in which the selling price was established was based on the applicable hierarchy of evidence 
total arrangement consideration was then allocated to each deliverable on the basis of the deliverable relative selling price 
in considering the hierarchy of evidence  we first determined whether vendor specific objective evidence of selling price or third party evidence of selling price existed 
we determined that neither vendor specific objective evidence of selling price nor third party evidence existed due to the uniqueness of our program 
as such  we developed our best estimate of the selling price for all deliverables 
for the selling price of travel  we considered a number of entity specific factors including the number of miles needed to redeem an award  average fare of comparable segments  breakage  restrictions  and other charges 
for licensing of brand and access to member lists  we considered both market specific factors and entity specific factors  including general profit margins realized in the marketplace industry  brand power  market royalty rates  and size of customer base 
for the advertising and marketing element  we considered market specific factors and entity specific factors including  our internal costs and fluctuations of costs of providing services  volume of marketing efforts  and overall advertising plan 
consideration allocated based on the relative selling price to both brand licensing and advertising elements is recognized as revenue when earned and recorded in non ticket revenue 
consideration allocated to award miles is deferred and recognized ratably as passenger revenue over the estimated period the transportation is expected to be provided which is currently estimated at months 
we used entity specific assumptions coupled with the various judgments necessary to determine the selling price of a deliverable in accordance with the required selling price hierarchy 
changes in these assumptions eg  cost of fare  number of miles to redeem awards  marketing plan  and approval rate of credit cards could result in changes in the estimated selling prices 
determining the frequency to reassess selling price for individual deliverables requires significant judgment 
for additional information  please see notes to financial statements summary of significant accounting policies frequent flier program 
aircraft maintenance  materials  repair costs and related heavy maintenance amortization 
we account for heavy maintenance under the deferral method 
under the deferral method the cost of heavy maintenance is capitalized and amortized as a component of depreciation and amortization expense until the earlier of the next estimated heavy maintenance event or the aircraft return at the end of the lease term 
amortization of engine and aircraft overhaul costs was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
if heavy maintenance costs were amortized within maintenance  material and repairs expense in the statement of operations  our maintenance  material and repairs expense would have been million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized million  million  and million of costs for heavy maintenance  respectively 
the timing of the next heavy maintenance event is estimated based on assumptions including estimated usage  faa mandated maintenance intervals and average removal times as suggested by the manufacturer 
these assumptions may change based on changes in our utilization of our aircraft  changes in government regulations and suggested manufacturer maintenance intervals 
in addition  these assumptions can be affected by unplanned incidents that could damage an airframe  engine  or major component to a level that would require a heavy maintenance event prior to a scheduled maintenance event 
to the extent our planned usage increases  the estimated life would decrease before the next maintenance event  resulting in additional expense over a shorter period 
heavy maintenance events are our year and year airframe checks hmv and hmv  respectively  engine overhauls  and overhauls to major components 
certain maintenance functions are outsourced under contracts that require payment based on a performance measure such as flight hours 
costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contracts  where labor and materials price risks have been transferred to the service provider  are accrued based on contractual payment terms 
routine cost for maintaining the airframes and engines and line maintenance are charged to maintenance  materials and repairs expense as performed 
maintenance reserves 
some of our master lease agreements provide that we pay maintenance reserves to aircraft lessors to be held as collateral in advance of our performance of major maintenance activities 
these lease agreements provide that maintenance reserves are reimbursable to us upon completion of the maintenance event in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the maintenance reserve held by the lessor associated with the specific maintenance event or the qualifying costs related to the specific maintenance event 
substantially all of these maintenance reserve payments are calculated based on a utilization measure  such as flight hours or cycles  and are used solely to collateralize the lessor for maintenance time run off the aircraft until the completion of the maintenance of the aircraft 
we paid million  million and million in maintenance reserves  net of reimbursement  to our lessors for the years ended december    and  respectively 
at lease inception and at each balance sheet date  we assess whether the maintenance reserve payments required by the master lease agreements are substantively and contractually related to the maintenance of the leased asset 
maintenance reserve payments that are substantively and contractually related to the maintenance of the leased asset are accounted for as maintenance deposits 
maintenance deposits expected to be recovered from lessors are reflected as prepaid maintenance deposits in the accompanying balance sheets 
when it is not probable we will recover amounts currently on deposit with a lessor  such amounts are expensed as supplemental rent 
because we we are required to pay maintenance reserves for our operating leased aircraft  and we chose to apply the deferral method for maintenance accounting  management expects that the final heavy maintenance events will be amortized over the remaining lease term rather than over the next estimated heavy maintenance event 
as a result  our maintenance costs in the last few years of leases could be significantly in excess of the costs in earlier periods 
in addition these late periods could include additional costs from unrecoverable maintenance reserve payments required in the late years of the lease 
we expensed million  million  and million of maintenance reserves as supplemental rent during   and  respectively 
as of december    and  we had prepaid maintenance deposits of million  million and million  respectively  on our balance sheets 
we have concluded that these prepaid maintenance deposits are probable of recovery primarily due to the rate differential between the maintenance reserve payments and the expected cost for the related next maintenance event that the reserves serve to collateralize 
these master lease agreements also provide that most maintenance reserves held by the lessor at the expiration of the lease are nonrefundable to us and will be retained by the lessor 
consequently  we have determined that any usage based maintenance reserve payments after the last major maintenance event are not substantively related to the maintenance of the leased asset and therefore are accounted for as contingent rent 
we accrue contingent rent beginning when it becomes probable and reasonably estimable we will incur such nonrefundable maintenance reserve payments 
we make certain assumptions at the inception of the lease and at each balance sheet date to determine the recoverability of maintenance deposits 
these assumptions are based on various factors such as the estimated time between the maintenance events  the cost of future maintenance events and the number of flight hours the aircraft is estimated to be utilized before it is returned to the lessor 
maintenance reserves held by lessors that are refundable to us at the expiration of the lease are accounted for as prepaid maintenance deposits on the balance sheet when they are paid 
results of operations in  we achieved a operating margin  down by points compared to  mostly driven by approximately million in lost revenues from the impact of hurricane sandy in the fourth quarter of in  we generated pre tax earnings of million and net earnings of million on operating revenues of  million 
for  we generated pre tax earnings of million and net earnings of million on operating revenues of  million and achieved a operating margin 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million in compared to the prior year  and as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the increase in operating income in over of million  or  is mainly due to a increase in revenue partially offset by increased fuel and other expenses 
revenue increased year over year as a result of a increase in capacity and a improvement in average yield 
fuel costs increased by million during compared to  primarily driven by an increase in consumption 
operating expenses increased primarily due to our growth in capacity resulting from the addition of eight aircraft to our fleet and our route network expansion

compared to operating revenue increased by million  or  to  million in compared to the prior year period as we increased traffic by and improved our yield by to cents 
our results for the year ended december  were driven by growing capacity compared to the prior year period while maintaining a high load factor of and a network reorientation in mid that added capacity in dallas fort worth  chicago and las vegas 
in october  we canceled flights  or million available seat miles  as a result of adverse weather conditions and airport closures in connection with hurricane sandy 
the negative impact of the storm on revenue was approximately million 
we generated greater demand in by lowering our average ticket revenue per passenger flight segment to  or by compared to the prior year period  while increasing our non ticket revenue per passenger flight segment from to  a increase compared to the prior year period 
total revenue per passenger flight segment increased from in to in we experienced a increase in non ticket revenues in compared to  reflecting the continued development and optimization of ancillary revenues and a increase in passenger flight segments 
during the fourth quarter of and continuing into  we further standardized our passenger usage fee across all markets and fare classes  which drove much of the increases in non ticket revenue in compared to non ticket revenue represented of total revenue in the year ended december  compared to in the same period of compared to operating revenues increased by million  or  to  million in compared to million in our capacity in terms of asms increased during compared to  primarily driven by the addition of airbus aircraft  five of which were delivered during  and the full year effect of our four deliveries 
our traffic as measured in terms of rpms increased by during compared to our aircraft operated an average of hours daily with of the seats full during compared to an average of hours daily with of the seats full during within operating revenues  passenger ticket revenue increased by to million in compared to million in this increase was driven primarily by a increase in passenger segments in compared to non ticket revenues increased by million in compared to  a increase primarily driven by the increase in passenger flight segments and price enhancements on non ticket services 
during the first quarter of  we reduced the weight threshold for overweight baggage from pounds to pounds and increased the amount charged to customers for modifying or canceling their reservations 
during the second quarter of  we increased bag rates purchased at check in on the web  the airport  and at the kiosk 
during the second half of  we began our efforts to standardize our passenger usage fee across all markets and fare classes 
as a result of experienced continued growth in revenue from many previously adopted non ticket revenue initiatives  our non ticket revenue per passenger flight segment increased to for from for effective april   we entered into a new five year affinity card program for the issuance of our free spirit credit cards with a new administrator 
during  we determined not to renew our agreement with the former administrator of our free spirit affinity credit card program at the scheduled expiration in february in connection with that non renewal  we entered into an agreement with the former administrator regarding the transition of the program to the new provider and the remittance to us of compensation due to us for card members obtained through our marketing services in the amount of million  of which million was recognized in the first quarter of and million was recognized in the fourth quarter of operating expenses since adopting our ultra low cost model  we have continuously sought to reduce our unit operating costs and have created what we believe is one of the lowest cost structures in our industry in the americas

compared to operating expense increased by million for compared to the prior year period mostly due to increases in fuel and labor costs  which were primarily driven by our capacity growth  in addition to increases in other operating costs 
our adjusted casm ex fuel for increased by as compared to the same period in during  we incurred higher other operating expenses driven by higher costs associated with passenger re accommodations related to slightly higher flight cancellations 
additionally  overall increased rates at the airports resulted in increased variable operating costs such as ground handling expenses and travel and lodging expense 
during  we also incurred an increase in maintenance costs related to our seat maintenance program and an increase in deferred heavy aircraft maintenance events  which in turn resulted in higher heavy maintenance amortization expense 
our average stage length for decreased by  contributing to the year over year increase in adjusted casm ex fuel 
aircraft fuel expenses includes both into plane expense as defined below plus the effect of mark to market adjustments to our portfolio of derivative instruments  which is a component of aircraft fuel expenses 
into plane fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport  or the into plane price  including taxes and fees 
into plane fuel prices are affected by world oil prices and refining costs  which can vary by region in the united states and the other countries where we operate 
both fuel consumption and prices increased during into plane fuel expense approximates cash paid to the supplier and does not reflect the effect of our fuel derivatives 
because our fuel derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  we recognize both realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of our derivatives when they occur as a component of aircraft fuel expense 
we evaluate economic fuel expense  which we define as into plane fuel expense excluding the cash we receive from or pay to counterparties for hedges that we settle during the relevant period  including hedges that we terminate early during the period 
the key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio 
when we refer to economic fuel expense  we include net settlement gains or losses only when they are realized through a cash payment from our derivative contract counterparties for those contracts that were settled during the period 
we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations 
accordingly  many industry analysts also evaluate airline results using this measure  and it is frequently used in our internal management reporting 
aircraft fuel expense increased from million in to million in  representing of our total operating expenses for that period 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in fuel gallons consumed as well as a increase in fuel prices 
the difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense and the elements of the changes are illustrated in the following table year ended december  percent change in thousands  except per gallon amounts into plane fuel expense cash received from settled derivatives  net of cash settlements paid economic fuel expense impact on fuel expense from unrealized gains and losses arising from mark to market adjustments to our outstanding fuel derivatives aircraft fuel expense per statement of operations fuel gallons consumed economic fuel cost per gallon into plane fuel cost per gallon fuel gallons consumed increased as a result of increased operations  as evidenced by an increase in block hours 
our average daily aircraft utilization in increased slightly compared to the prior year period 
we estimate the fuel savings related to the flights cancellations due to hurricane sandy were approximately million 
total net loss recognized for hedges that settled during was million  compared to a net gain of million in the prior year period 
these amounts represent the net cash paid received for the settlement of hedges 
labor costs in increased by million  or  compared to  primarily driven by a increase in our pilot and flight attendant workforce as we increased our fleet size by  or eight aircraft  during during  we incurred an incremental million of share based compensation recorded within salaries  wages and benefits  driven primarily by the commencement of the performance share awards program in during  aircraft rent increased million  or  mainly due to the delivery of eight airbus a aircraft subsequent to the fourth quarter of all aircraft were financed through operating leases 
the increase of aircraft rent expense on a per asm basis is primarily due to the fact that we incurred million of additional aircraft rent during related to a short term lease agreement with a third party provider wet leased aircraft to maintain desired capacity during the summer months 
landing fees and other rents for increased by million  or  compared to primarily due to a increase in departures 
on a per asm basis  the increase in landing fees and other rents of during as compared to the prior year period is due to increased volume at higher cost airports  including the addition of six new airports served in  which on average are higher cost airports than the system average 
the increase in distribution expense of million  or  in compared to was primarily due to increased volume and an increase of approximately percentage points year over year in the percentage of sales from third party travel agents  which are more expensive than sales directly through our website 
this shift in distribution mix did not materially affect operating income because the revenues received from sales through third party travel agents are designed to at least offset the associated incremental costs 
the decrease on a per unit basis is primarily due to a decrease of approximately in credit card fee rates period over period 
the following table shows our distribution channel usage year ended december  change website third party travel agents call center maintenance  materials and repair costs increased by million  or  in the increase in maintenance costs is primarily due to million in one time start up costs of the seat maintenance program  which was introduced and completed in we do not expect the ongoing expense of our seat maintenance program to have a material impact on our overall future maintenance cost outlook 
the average age of our fleet increased to years as of december  from years as of december  maintenance expense is expected to increase significantly as our fleet continues to age  resulting in the need for additional repairs over time 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  primarily due to deferred heavy aircraft maintenance events  which in turn resulted in higher amortization expense recorded in compared to the prior year period 
other operating expenses in increased by million  or  compared to primarily due to an increase in departures of 
overall increased rates at the airports we serve resulted in increased variable operating costs such as ground handling expenses and travel and lodging expense in compared to the prior year 
the increase on a per asm basis of is primarily due to a shift in our route network to include higher volumes at the higher cost airports we serve 
in addition  we experienced increases in travel and lodging costs driven by both volume and hotel rate increases associated with increased training and scope of operations  as well as higher passenger re accommodation expenses associated with slightly higher flight cancellations during we also incurred additional expenses related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system 
special charges credits for primarily include a million gain related to the sale of four permanent air carrier slots at ronald reagan national airport dca  offset by million in secondary offering costs 
special charges credits for relate to termination costs of million in connection with our ipo  including million paid to indigo partners  llc to terminate its professional services agreement with us and million paid to three individual  unaffiliated holders of our subordinated notes 
compared to our operating expenses increased by million  or  for compared to the corresponding period in the increase is primarily related to a increase in fuel costs  increase in labor cost  and a increase in aircraft rent 
aircraft fuel expense for increased million  or  compared to the prior year period due to a increase in the average price of aircraft fuel per gallon and a increase in gallons consumed

our pilot and flight attendant headcount increased and  respectively  as we increased our fleet size by via the addition of five aircraft during the increase in labor costs was also driven by the increase in pilot labor rates by approximately during aircraft rent expense for increased by million  or  compared to mainly due to taking delivery of five airbus a aircraft which were financed via operating leases 
in addition  approximately million in maintenance reserves were expensed as supplemental rent in as it was deemed they would not be reimbursed 
distribution expense for increased by million  or  compared to  primarily due to increased credit card fees driven by the increase in revenue 
additionally  there was a shift in the percentage of bookings made from our website to more expensive third party distribution channels gdss  which increased to approximately in from approximately in this shift also drove the increase in distribution expense on a per unit basis  along with the increase in credit card fees per unit due to the growth in revenues outpacing the growth in units year over year 
the following table shows our distribution channel usage year ended december  change website third party travel agents call center maintenance  materials and repair costs for increased by million  or  compared to this increase was primarily due to a increase in flight hour based maintenance expenses driven by higher flight hours 
non flight hour based maintenance increased as a result of the timing of scheduled maintenance events and the aging fleet 
as the fleet ages  we expect that maintenance costs and related out of service time to complete the maintenance will increase 
the increase in capacity during resulted in increased landing fees and other operating expenses in compared to other operating expenses for increased by million  or  compared to and are generally driven by the increase in capacity  new stations start ups  and increases in rates 
we experienced notable increases in ground handling and crew travel and lodging cost partly due to increased flights and the changes in route mix 
these increases in cost were offset by a decrease in costs incurred to accommodate displaced passengers due to the aggressive management of cost and strict adherence to our accommodation policy 
special charges credits for increased by million  or  compared to due to termination costs incurred in connection with the ipo during the second quarter of  comprised of million paid to indigo partners  llc to terminate its professional services agreement with us and million paid to three individual  unaffiliated holders of our subordinated notes

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash on hand and cash provided by operations 
our primary uses of liquidity are for working capital needs  capital expenditures  aircraft pre delivery deposits pdps  and maintenance reserves 
our total cash at december  was million  an increase of million from december  during  we completed our ipo  which raised net proceeds of million after repayment of debt  payment of transaction expenses and payments of fees to certain unaffiliated holders of our notes 
additionally  during  the ipo allowed us to amend our agreements with our credit card processors enabling us to eliminate our restricted cash balance  which was million at year end  and increase our unrestricted cash balance 
in prior periods  restricted cash represented cash collateral related primarily to a portion of our obligation to fulfill future flights  or air traffic liability atl  held by credit card processors 
our credit card processors have historically required holdbacks collateral  which we record as restricted cash  when future air travel and other future services are purchased via credit card transactions 
at september   our restricted cash balance was eliminated  reflecting a complete release of all holdback requirements by all of our credit card processors provided that we continue to satisfy certain financial criteria 
failure to meet these liquidity covenants would provide the processors the right to reinstate a holdback  resulting in a commensurate reduction of unrestricted cash that could be material 
as of december   we continued to be in compliance with our credit card processing agreements  and we were not subject to any credit card holdbacks

net cash flows provided by operating activities 
operating activities in provided million in cash compared to million provided in the decrease is primarily due to million received from the release of all credit card holdbacks in coupled with significantly higher heavy scheduled maintenance cost in  slightly offset by higher cash received on future travel as of december  operating activities in provided million in cash compared to million in cash generated in the increase is primarily due to the release of all our holdbacks by our credit card processors and higher earnings during compared to net cash flows used in investing activities 
during  investing activities used million  compared to million used for the prior year period 
the decrease is mainly due to the refund of million in pdps related to the delivery of seven aircraft from airbus and corresponding sale and leaseback transactions  and the sale of airport slots for million 
these effects were offset by higher capital expenditures  including the purchase of two spare engines for million during during  investing activities used million  compared to million used for the increase is mainly related to higher pdps made period over period due to timing of the delivery schedule for future aircraft  coupled with slightly higher capital expenditures including a spare engine for which we entered into a sale lease back transaction during in addition  million in returned pdps were received from two completed aircraft sale and leaseback transactions 
net cash provided by financing activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions we are subject to certain market risks  including commodity prices specifically aircraft fuel 
the adverse effects of changes in these markets could pose a potential loss as discussed below 
the sensitivity analysis provided below does not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor does it consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
aircraft fuel 
our results of operations can vary materially due to changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
aircraft fuel expense for the years ended december   and represented approximately   and of our operating expenses 
increases in aircraft fuel prices or a shortage of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results 
we source a significant portion of our fuel from refining resources located in the southeast united states  particularly facilities adjacent to the gulf of mexico 
gulf coast fuel is subject to volatility and supply disruptions  particularly during hurricane season when refinery shutdowns have occurred  or when the threat of weather related disruptions has caused gulf coast fuel prices to spike above other regional sources 
during peak hurricane season august through october  we may enter into jet fuel swaps to protect the refining price risk between the price of crude oil and the price of refined jet fuel 
in addition to other fuel derivative contracts  we have historically protected approximately of our forecasted fuel requirements during peak hurricane season using jet fuel swaps 
gulf coast jet indexed fuel is the basis for a substantial majority of our fuel consumption 
based on our annual fuel consumption  a increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel would have increased into plane aircraft fuel cost for by approximately million 
to attempt to manage fuel price risk  from time to time we use jet fuel option contracts or swap agreements and basis swaps to mitigate a portion of the crack spread between crude and jet fuel 
as of december   we had fuel hedges using us gulf coast jet fuel collars in place for approximately of its anticipated fuel consumption 
the fair value of our fuel derivative contracts as of december  and was million and million net asset liability  respectively 
we measure our financial derivative instruments at fair value 
fair value of the instruments is determined using standard option valuation models 
we measure the fair value of the derivative instruments based on either quoted market prices or values provided by the counterparty 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  we do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
as of december   we believe the credit exposure related to these fuel forward contracts was negligible 
interest rates 
we have market risk associated with changing interest rates due to libor based lease rates on five of our aircraft 
a hypothetical change in interest rates in would affect total aircraft rent expense in by less than million
