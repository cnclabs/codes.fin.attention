item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations kellogg company and subsidiaries results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company  our operations and our present business environment 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item of this report 
for more than years  consumers have counted on kellogg for great tasting  high quality and nutritious foods 
kellogg is the world s leading producer of cereal  second largest producer of cookies and crackers  and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods 
additional product offerings include toaster pastries  cereal bars  fruit flavored snacks and veggie foods 
kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally 
we manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location 
these operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics  products  production processes  types or classes of customers  distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments 
we report results of operations in the following reportable segments us morning foods kashi  us snacks  us specialty  north america other  europe  latin america  and asia pacific 
the reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets 
these targets are to for internal net sales  mid single digit to for underlying operating profit  and high single digit to for currency neutral underlying diluted net earnings per share 
internal net sales growth and internal operating profit growth exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and  if applicable  acquisitions  dispositions and transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the pringles business pringles 
in addition to these items  internal operating profit growth also includes the benefit of allocating a portion of costs related to our support functions that are now being leveraged to provide support to the pringles business 
as a result of adopting the accounting change discussed below  comparability of certain financial measures is impacted significantly by the mark to market adjustments that are recorded annually  or more frequently if a re measurement event occurs 
to provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our underlying operating performance we use non gaap financial measures within the md a that exclude the impact of mark to market adjustments 
these non gaap financial measures include underlying gross margin  underlying gross profit  underlying sga  underlying operating margin  underlying operating profit  underlying operating profit growth  underlying income taxes  underlying net income attributable to kellogg company  underlying basic earnings per share eps  underlying diluted eps  and underlying diluted eps growth 
underlying operating profit growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation  mark to market adjustments  and  if applicable  acquisitions  dispositions  and transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the pringles business 
during we completed the acquisition of the pringles business from the procter gamble company p g for billion  including working capital adjustments  which was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of billion of short and long term debt 
in the fourth quarter of we changed our accounting for recognizing expense for our pension and post retirement benefit plans 
historically we deferred actuarial gains and losses from these plans and recognized the financial impact to the income statement over several years 
under the new accounting method  gains and losses from these plans are recognized in an annual mark to market adjustment that is recorded in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if a re measurement event occurs earlier in the year 
concurrent with the accounting change  we have elected to modify the allocation of pension and post retirement benefit plan costs to reportable segments 
historically all costs for these plans were allocated to reportable segments for management evaluation and reporting purposes 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we have included the service cost of these plans within the financial results of the reportable segments 
all other costs related to these plans  such as interest cost  expected return on plan assets  and the annual mark to market adjustment will be reported in corporate 
these changes have been applied retrospectively 
financial results from prior periods have been recast to include the impact as if the changes had been in place during those periods 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this accounting change

asia pacific s operating profit growth was positively impacted by the prior year impairment charges related to our business in china 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the china impairment

underlying gross margin  which excludes the impact of mark to market adjustments on pension and post retirement benefit plans  declined by basis points in as a result of cost inflation and the lower margin structure of the pringles business  which was partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives 
underlying sga  which excludes the impact of mark to market adjustments on pension and post retirement benefit plans  was consistent with underlying gross margin declined by basis points in due to the expanded investments in our supply chain  and increased cost pressures for fuel  energy  and commodities  which were partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives

foreign currency translation the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar 
certain of our assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily in the euro  british pound  mexican peso  australian dollar and canadian dollar 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we must translate those assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates 
as a result  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements  even if their value has not changed in their original currency 
this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 
interest expense annual interest expense is illustrated in the following table 
the increase in was primarily due to increased debt levels associated with the acquisition of pringles  partially offset by lower interest rates on our long term debt 
the decline from to was primarily due to lower interest rates on our long term debt

additionally  the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters  including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives  are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 
product withdrawal refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions 
our cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
we believe that our operating cash flows  together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing  will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that volatility and or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations 
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows dollars in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings  meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products  net of costs to manufacture and market our products 
our net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  million  an increase of million compared with the increase compared to the prior year is primarily due to improved performance in working capital resulting from the benefit derived from the pringles acquisition 
our net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  million  an increase of million compared with  reflecting lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and lower payments for incentive compensation partially offset by a marginal increase in core working capital in our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding  based on a trailing month average is relatively short  equating to approximately days for  days for and days for core working capital in averaged of net sales  compared to in and in during  core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory 
during  core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory and higher days of trade receivables 
for both and  higher days of inventory was necessary to support our new product introductions and to maintain appropriate levels of service while investing in our supply chain infrastructure 
in  higher days of trade receivables resulted from strong sales at year end due to our innovation launches and special k new year s resolution programs 
our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we made incremental contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans amounting to million million  net of tax 
the pension protection act ppa  and subsequent regulations  determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states 
we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until or beyond 
our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance  future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 
we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in of approximately million 
actual contributions could be different from our current projections  as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities  future changes in government requirements  trust asset performance  renewals of union contracts  or higher than expected health care claims cost experience 
we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions 
we use this non gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment  dividend distributions  acquisition opportunities  and share repurchases 
our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities additions to properties cash flow year over year change year over year changes in cash flow as defined were driven by improved performance in working capital resulting from the benefit derived from the pringles acquisition  as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the three year period 
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for amounted to  million  an increase of  million compared with primarily attributable to the  acquisition of pringles in capital spending in included investments in our supply chain infrastructure  and to support capacity requirements in certain markets  including pringles 
in addition  we continued the investment in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform 
net cash used in investing activities of million in increased by million compared with  reflecting capital projects for our reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform and investments in our supply chain 
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has decreased to in  from in  which was an increase from in financing activities in february  we issued million of two year floating rate us dollar notes  and million of ten year us dollar notes 
the proceeds from these notes will be used for general corporate purposes  including  together with cash on hand  repayment of the million aggregate principal amount of our us dollar notes due march the floating rate notes bear interest equal to three month libor plus basis points  subject to quarterly reset 
the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of kellogg company and its restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease back transactions  as well as a change of control provision 
our net cash provided by financing activities was  for  compared to net cash used in financing activities of and for and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided from financing activities in compared to and  was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of pringles 
total debt was billion at year end and billion at year end in march  we entered into interest rate swaps on our million five year fixed rate us dollar notes due  million ten year fixed rate us dollar notes due and million of our million seven year fixed rate us dollar notes due the interest rate swaps effectively converted these notes from their fixed rates to floating rate obligations through maturity 
in may  we issued million of three year us dollar notes  million of five year us dollar notes and million of ten year us dollar notes  resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of billion 
the proceeds of these notes were used for general corporate purposes  including financing a portion of the acquisition of pringles 
in may  we issued cdn 
million of two year fixed rate canadian dollar notes  using the proceeds from these notes for general corporate purposes  which included repayment of intercompany debt 
this repayment resulted in cash available to be used for a portion of the acquisition of pringles 
in december  we repaid million five year us dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper 
in february  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our million seven year fixed rate us dollar notes due the interest rate swaps effectively converted this portion of the notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity 
in april  we repaid million ten year us dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper 
in may  we issued million of seven year fixed rate us dollar notes  using the proceeds of million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper 
during  we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million  which effectively converted these notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity 
in november  we issued million of five year fixed rate u 
s 
dollar notes  using the proceeds of million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper 
during  we entered into interest rate swaps which effectively converted these notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity 
in april  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to billion during through this three year authorization replaced previous share buyback programs which had authorized stock repurchases of up to billion for and million for under this program  we repurchased approximately million  million and million shares of common stock for million  million and billion during  and  respectively 
in december  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to million during we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling per share in  per share in and per share in total cash paid for dividends increased by in and in in march  we entered into an unsecured four year credit agreement which allows us to borrow  on a revolving credit basis  up to billion 
our long term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease back transactions 
some agreements also contain change in control provisions 
however  they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings 
a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future 
however  even under these circumstances  we would continue to have access to our four year credit agreement  which expires in march this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis  although we do not currently plan to use it 
capital and credit markets  including commercial paper markets  continued to experience instability and disruption as the us and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty 
throughout this period of uncertainty  we continued to have access to the us  european  and canadian commercial paper markets 
our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment 
we monitor the financial strength of our third party financial institutions  including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities  our derivative financial instruments  and other arrangements 
we are in compliance with all covenants as of december  we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future  while still meeting our operational needs  including the pursuit of selected bolt on acquisitions 
this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow  our short term borrowings  and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and december  we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  contractual obligations payments due by period millions total and beyond long term debt principal interest a capital leases b operating leases c purchase obligations d uncertain tax positions e other long term obligations f total a includes interest payments on our long term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps 
interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward rate curve as of december  b the total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling approximately million over the periods presented above 
c operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases 
d purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing  advertising and other services 
the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans  but are not obligated to incur 
therefore  it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts 
e as of december   our total liability for uncertain tax positions was million  of which million  is expected to be paid in the next twelve months 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining million 
f other long term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year end and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements  multiemployer plans  and supplemental employee retirement benefits 
the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through as follows  critical accounting estimates promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in store displays and events  feature price discounts  consumer coupons  contests and loyalty programs 
the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded  which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer 
these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs 
differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
on a full year basis  these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately of our company s net sales 
however  our company s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately of net sales  therefore  it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
property long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
management evaluates several conditions  including  but not limited to  the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  including an extended period of idleness  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for assets to be held and used  we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset 
if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data 
there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 
at december   we have property  plant and equipment of billion  net of accumulated depreciation  on our balance sheet 
included in this amount are approximately million of idle assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 
our analysis excluded goodwill and other intangible assets related to the pringles acquisition on may  pringles intangible assets will be tested for impairment in the second quarter of goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
for the goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples 
our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash flows 
management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 
similarly  impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset 
fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset 
for instance  cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants 
these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data  current and anticipated market conditions  management plans  and market comparables 
we also evaluate the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to billion  consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the acquisition of keebler foods company and the acquisition of pringles 
within this total  approximately billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived  comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks 
we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows 
at december   the fair value of our us snacks reporting unit  excluding pringles  exceeded its book value by billion 
however  if we had used materially different assumptions  which we do not believe are reasonably possible  regarding the future performance of our business or a different weighted average cost of capital in the valuation  this could have resulted in significant impairment losses 
additionally  we have million of goodwill related to our acquisition of united bakers in russia 
the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the russian reporting unit was approximately in and if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and ebitda in the valuation  this could have resulted in an impairment loss 
for example  if our projection of ebitda margins had been lower by basis points  this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the russian reporting unit 
management will continue to monitor the situation closely 
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada 
plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance 
a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments 
we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans 
inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rates  and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans  which cover employees in the united states  united kingdom and canada 
in the fourth quarter of  we elected to change our policy for recognizing expense for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits 
previously  we recognized actuarial gains and losses associated with benefit obligations in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet upon each plan remeasurement  amortizing them into operating results over the average future service period of active employees in these plans 
under the new policy  we have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur  eliminating the amortization 
actuarial gains and losses will be recognized annually as of our measurement date  which is our fiscal year end  or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 
additionally  for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits  we will no longer use the market related value of plan assets  an averaging technique permitted under generally accepted accounting principles  but instead will use the fair value of plan assets 
to conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets  we model expected returns over a year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans 
the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds  price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices  and long term inflation 
our us plan model  corresponding to approximately of our trust assets globally  currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of and an active management premium of net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations 
although we review our expected long term rates of return annually  our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
our expected rates of return have generally not been revised  provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the th and th percentile of expected long term returns  as determined by our modeling process 
while our expected rate of return for of was supported by historical performance and equated to approximately the nd percentile of our model  we have elected to lower our expected rate of return to in this reduction is based on the expectation to de risk the plan investment portfolio over time and as the market allows 
our assumed rate of return for us plans in of equates to approximately the st percentile expectation of our model 
similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets  reflecting local economic conditions 
foreign trust investments represent approximately of our global benefit plan assets 
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december   a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease benefits expense by approximately million 
for each of the three fiscal years  our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions  to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates  we model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
in comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately  our initial trend rate for of reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population 
our initial rate is trended downward by per year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefits expense by approximately million and generate an immediate loss recognition of million 
a basis point excess of actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately million and would increase expense by million 
any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur 
the experience gain arising from recognition of claims experience was approximately million 
to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we selected the discount rate based on a cash flow matching analysis using towers watson s proprietary rate link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans 
rate link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments  as is generated by discounting each year s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year 
the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the th to th percentile of us high quality bonds 
a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe  except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the th and th percentiles are preferable 
the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end 
accordingly  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase benefits expense by approximately million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of million 
all obligation related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur 
despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
during  we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately million compared to approximately million in of the total net loss recognized in  approximately million was related primarily to unfavorable changes in the discount rate  offset by approximately million in asset gains during of the million net loss recognized in  approximately million was related to unfavorable changes in the discount rate that were partially offset by the adoption of an employer group waiver plan egwp design for prescription drug costs for the us retiree medical plan  and million was related to unfavorable asset performance 
during  we made contributions in the amount of million to kellogg s global tax qualified pension programs 
this amount was mostly non discretionary 
additionally we contributed million to our retiree medical programs 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment 
income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 
we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  new or emerging legislation and tax planning 
the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained 
significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards to be adopted in future periods reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an updated accounting standard which requires companies to present information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements 
the updated standard is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing in july  the fasb issued an updated accounting standard to allow entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test 
under the updated standard an entity would not be required to perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the updated standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt the updated standard in connection with our impairment evaluations to be completed in the second and fourth quarters of future outlook we anticipate will be a return to our on going operating model 
in recent years we have invested in the business  adjusted our strategy to focus more on growth  and acquired pringles 
with the foundation that we have set as a result of this work  we expect to realize growth in through increased investment in advertising and continued investment behind a strong line up of innovation launches 
we expect reported net sales will increase by approximately percent  gross margin to decline approximately basis points due to the full year impact of the pringles business  reported operating profit to grow slightly more than eps  and reported eps to grow by to percent 
projected eps growth includes a to impact from pringles integration costs 
this outlook excludes the impact of mark to market adjustments on our pension and post retirement benefit plans as well as commodity contracts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to certain market risks  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
we use derivative financial and commodity instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 
foreign exchange risk our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third party purchases  intercompany transactions  and when applicable  nonfunctional currency denominated third party debt 
our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro  british pound  australian dollar  canadian dollar  and mexican peso  and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions  the british pound versus the euro 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts  options  and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions 
forward contracts and options are generally less than months duration 
currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement receivable of million 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was billion  representing a settlement obligation of million 
all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions  translational exposure  or existing assets or liabilities  and mature within months 
assuming an unfavorable change in year end exchange rates  the settlement receivable would have decreased by approximately million at year end and the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 
venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings 
as of the end of our fiscal year  we used the parallel rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary s financial statements to us dollars 
in may  the venezuelan government effectively eliminated the parallel market 
in june  several large venezuelan commercial banks began operating the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme 
accordingly  we began using the sitme rate as of january  to translate our venezuelan subsidiary s financial statements to us dollars 
during  we recorded a million foreign exchange gain in other income expense  net  associated with the translation of our subsidiary s financials into us dollars  with no impact during or in february  the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the official exchange rate 
additionally  the sitme was eliminated 
accordingly  in we will begin using the official exchange rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary s financial statements to us dollar 
on a consolidated basis  venezuela represents less than of our business  therefore  any ongoing impact is expected to be immaterial 
interest rate risk our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates  london interbank offered rates libor  and commercial paper rates 
we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues  and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
during and  we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes 
refer to disclosures contained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end was billion  representing a settlement receivable of million 
the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end was million  representing a settlement receivable of million 
assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million at year end and million at year end price risk our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials  fuel  and energy 
primary exposures include corn  wheat  soybean oil  sugar  cocoa  cartonboard  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
we have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers  and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than months 
during  we entered into two separate year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes 
the notional amount of the swaps totaled million as of december  and equates to approximately of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period 
at year end december  the notional amount was million 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the north america natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end  and million at year end  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above  we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials  including rice  sugar  cartonboard  and corrugated boxes 
it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company 
reciprocal collateralization agreements in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds 
these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash  treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount 
as of december   we had received million cash collateral from a counterparty  which was reflected as a decrease in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had posted collateral of million in the form of cash  which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable  net on the consolidated balance sheet
