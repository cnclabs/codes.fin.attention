our results of operations for were affected by the following key transactions and events 
acquisition of elpida memory  inc on july   we completed our acquisition of elpida memory  inc elpida  a japanese corporation  pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended  the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july  with the trustees of elpida and one of its subsidiaries  akita elpida memory  inc  a japanese corporation akita and  together with elpida  the elpida companies pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan 
we paid million for the acquisition of of elpida equity 
on july   we also acquired a ownership interest in rexchip electronics corporation rexchip  a taiwanese corporation and manufacturing joint venture formed by powerchip technology corporation powerchip and elpida  from powerchip and certain of its affiliates the powerchip group pursuant to a share purchase agreement 
we paid million in cash for the shares 
elpida and it subsidiaries the elpida group own approximately of rexchip outstanding common stock 
therefore  as a result of the consummation of our acquisition of elpida and the rexchip shares from the powerchip group  we own approximately of rexchip common stock 
the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include  among other items  cash and restricted cash aggregating  million  inventories of million  property  plant and equipment of million  net deferred tax assets of million and debt of  million 
elpida assets include  among others a mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima  japan  its ownership interest in rexchip  whose assets include a mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in taichung city  taiwan  and an assembly and test facility located in akita  japan 
the elpida and rexchip fabrication facilities together represent approximately one third of our wafer capacity 
elpida semiconductor memory products include mobile dram  targeted toward mobile phones and tablets 
we believe that combining the complementary product portfolios of micron and elpida strengthens our position in the memory market and enables us to provide customers with a wider portfolio of high quality memory solutions 
we also believe that the elpida transaction strengthens our market position in the memory industry through increased research and development and manufacturing scale  improved access to core memory market segments  and additional wafer capacity to balance among our dram  nand flash and nor flash memory solutions 
elpida operations are included primarily in the dsg and wsg segments 
our results of operations for included approximately one month of operating results from the elpida operations  which accounted for sales of million and net income of million 
the elpida companies are currently subject to corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan 
both of the elpida companies have adopted plans of reorganization which set forth the treatment of the elpida companies pre petition creditors and their claims  which plans were approved by the elpida companies creditors and the tokyo district court in february the plans of reorganization provide for payments by the elpida companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of billion yen or the equivalent of approximately billion as of august   less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items 
the plans of reorganization provide for the elpida companies pre petition creditors to be paid in seven installments 
the initial installment payment of billion yen million as of august   which amount is subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganization  was paid in october substantially all of the million that we paid in connection with the elpida acquisition was deposited into accounts that are legally restricted for payment to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in october and was presented as restricted cash in the amount of million on our august  balance sheet 
the remaining billion yen or the equivalent of approximately billion as of august  of installment payments payable to the elpida companies creditors are scheduled to be made by the elpida companies in six annual installments payable beginning on december  pursuant to the terms of the sponsor agreement  we entered into a series of agreements with the elpida companies  including supply agreements  research and development services agreements and general services agreements  which are intended to generate more stable operating cash flows to meet the requirements of the elpida companies businesses  including the funding of the installment payments to the elpida companies creditors 
we anticipate that  once fully in effect  payments made under these agreements will generally cover all of elpida and akita costs 
to mitigate the risk from the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the proposed elpida acquisition  we entered into a series of currency exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to yen and new taiwan dollar payments the elpida hedges 
these currency exchange contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and were remeasured at fair value each period with gains and losses recognized in other operating income expense 
as a result of mark to market adjustments for the elpida hedges  we recorded losses to other non operating expense of million in as of august   our cumulative loss on the elpida hedges was million 
see item financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements acquisition of elpida memory  inc for further details of the acquisition 
inotera memories  inc on january   we entered into agreements with nanya technology corporation nanya to amend the joint venture relationship involving inotera 
the amendments included a new supply agreement the inotera supply agreement  retroactively beginning on january   between us and inotera under which we are obligated to purchase for an initial three year term substantially all of inotera output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components 
the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one year extensions and if in any year the parties do not agree to an extension  the agreement will terminate following the end of the then existing term plus a subsequent three year wind down period 
our share of inotera capacity would decline over the three year wind down period 
effective through december   we had rights and obligations to purchase of inotera wafer production capacity based on a margin sharing formula among nanya  inotera and us 
our cost for product purchased from inotera under the supply agreements was  million for  million for and million for under a cost sharing arrangement effective through december   we generally shared dram process and design development costs with nanya 
as a result of the january  agreements  which were retroactively effective beginning on january   nanya no longer participates in the joint development program 
pursuant to this cost sharing arrangement  our r d costs were reduced by million for  million for and million for results of operations consolidated results for the year ended net sales cost of goods sold gross margin sg a r d restructure and asset impairments other operating income expense  net operating income loss gain on acquisition of elpida interest income expense  net other non operating income expense  net income tax provision benefit equity in net loss of equity method investees net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income loss attributable to micron in the second quarter of  we reclassified gains losses from changes in currency exchange rates from other operating income expense  net to other non operating income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income

net sales for the year ended dsg nsg wsg esg all other total net sales for increased as compared to reflecting increases in dsg  esg and wsg sales primarily due to higher levels of dram and nand flash gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
the increases in gigabit sales volumes for were primarily attributable to manufacturing efficiencies driven by improvements in product and process technology  increased dram supply from inotera due to the restructuring of our supply agreement and million of dram sales from elpida since its acquisition on july  total net sales decreased for as compared to  reflecting declines in average selling prices across all reportable segments partially offset by increases in sales volumes 
wsg sales decreased for as compared to primarily due to declines in average selling prices and in nor flash sales volumes  as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular  as well as a continued transition by customers from nor flash to nand flash 
dsg sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by increases in sales volumes 
nsg and esg sales increased due to increases in sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
sales for all other segments  were primarily composed of sales of cmos image sensors 
on may   we sold micron technology italia  srl  mit a wholly owned subsidiary  including its mm wafer fabrication facility assets in avezzano  italy  to lfoundry marsica srl lfoundry 
in connection with the sale  we assigned to lfoundry our supply agreement with aptina imaging corporation aptina for cmos image sensors manufactured at the avezzano facility 
since the sale  we have had no sales of cmos image sensors

nand solutions group nsg for the year ended net sales operating income nsg sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices  gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of nand flash products 
see operating results by product nand flash for further detail 
nsg sales for were relatively unchanged from as increases in gigabits sold were partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
increases in gigabits sold for were primarily due to improvements in product and process technologies 
nsg sells a portion of its products to intel through our im flash joint venture at long term negotiated prices approximating cost 
all other nsg products are sold to oems  resellers  retailers and other customers including intel  which we collectively refer to as trade customers 
on april   we acquired intel remaining ownership interest in imfs  a joint venture between us and intel  which operated a wafer fabrication facility in singapore 
on april   we also acquired the assets of imft located at our virginia fabrication facility and terminated the imfs supply agreement 
accordingly  we now obtain all of the nand flash output from our singapore and virginia wafer fabrication facilities 
prior to these acquisitions  we sold a portion of the nand flash output from these facilities to intel  through our consolidated imfs and imft joint ventures  at long term negotiated prices approximating cost 
on april   we also entered into a new supply agreement with intel under which we sell intel nand flash products from us on a cost plus basis 
aggregate nsg sales to intel including sales by imft at prices approximating cost and sales by us under the new cost plus supply agreement were million for  million for and million for as a result of these april  transactions  in nsg sales of nand flash products to trade customers increased and sales to intel at long term negotiated prices approximating cost decreased 
nsg sales of nand flash products to trade customers increased for as compared to primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
nsg operating income for was essentially unchanged from as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices and increases in r d costs 
manufacturing cost reductions resulted primarily from improvements in product and process technologies

nsg operating income declined from to primarily due to decreases in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions 
cost reductions resulted primarily from improvements in product and process technologies 
nsg operating income for benefited from a million gain from an allocated portion of the samsung patent cross license agreement 
wireless solutions group wsg for the year ended net sales operating income loss in  wsg sales were comprised primarily of dram  nand flash and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue 
wsg sales increased for as compared to primarily due to higher sales of mobile dram products as a result of the acquisition of elpida 
we expect that wsg sales of mobile dram products will increase significantly in primarily due to our acquisition of elpida 
wsg results of operations for included sales of million and operating income of million from the acquired elpida operations 
increases in wsg sales for from mobile dram were partially offset by declines in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular  as well as a continued transition by customers to nand flash 
wsg sales in were also adversely impacted by lower sales of nand flash products sold in multi chip packages 
the improvement in wsg operating margin for was primarily due to reductions in manufacturing  sg a and r d costs 
in  wsg sales were comprised of nor flash  nand flash and dram in decreasing order of revenue 
the decrease in wsg sales for as compared to was primarily due to declines in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular  as well as a continued transition by customers to nand flash 
wsg sales in were also adversely impacted by lower sales of nand flash products sold in multi chip packages 
the decline in wsg operating margin for was primarily due to the reductions in average selling prices and in nor flash sales volumes 
in addition  wsg operating margin for benefited from a million gain from an allocated portion of the samsung patent cross license agreement 
embedded solutions group esg for the year ended net sales operating income in  esg sales were comprised of nor flash  dram and nand flash in decreasing order of revenue 
esg sales increased for as compared to primarily due to increased sales volume of nand flash  dram and nor flash products as esg continued to expand its customer base  partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
esg operating income for improved from primarily due to higher gross margins as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices 
in  esg sales were comprised of nor flash  dram and nand flash in decreasing order of revenue 
the increase in esg sales for as compared to was primarily due to increased sales volume of dram  nand flash and nor flash products as esg continued to expand its customer base  partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
esg operating income for declined as compared to due to decreases in average selling prices and higher costs associated with underutilized capacity in our nor flash facilities 
in addition  esg operating margin for benefited from a million gain from an allocated portion of the samsung patent cross license agreement 
operating results by product net sales by product for the year ended dram nand flash nor flash other in order to balance our future product mix in anticipation of the closing of the elpida transaction  in the fourth quarter of we began to transition production at our dram fabrication facility in singapore from dram to nand flash 
we expect this transition to nand flash production will occur over approximately four quarters  depending on market conditions and result in a marginal reduction in wafer production during the period of this transition 
dram for the year ended percentage change from prior period net sales average selling prices per gigabit gigabits sold cost per gigabit the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for as compared to was primarily due to increased output obtained from our inotera joint venture under the new supply agreement  improved product and process technologies and the acquisition of elpida on july  effective on january   we entered into the new inotera supply agreement under which we purchase substantially all of inotera output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components 
prior to the new inotera supply agreement we had the right to purchase of inotera wafer production capacity based on a margin sharing formula among nanya  inotera and us 
see overview inotera memories  inc our cost of product purchased from inotera under these supply agreements was  million for  million for  and million for our cost of product purchased from inotera has increased since the beginning of calendar and was higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly owned facilities in the fourth quarter of dram products acquired from inotera accounted for of our dram gigabit production for as compared to for and for as of june   inotera current liabilities exceeded its current assets by billion  which exposes inotera to liquidity risk 
additionally  inotera incurred net losses of million for its fiscal year ended december  as of june   inotera was not in compliance with certain of its loan covenants  and had not been in compliance for the past several years  which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year 
inotera has applied for a waiver from complying with the june  financial covenants 
inotera management has implemented plans to improve its liquidity and for inotera six month period ended june   inotera generated net income of million  however  there can be no assurance that inotera will be successful in sufficiently improving its liquidity and complying with their loan covenants  which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year 
our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for improved from primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions as a result of improvements in product and process technology partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
dram sales and gross margins for were adversely impacted by the effects of the million charge to revenue for a settlement with a customer 
we expect that our gigabit production and sales volumes of dram products will increase significantly in due to our acquisition of elpida 
elpida has mm wafer fabrication facilities in japan and taiwan that are dedicated to the production of dram products 
we expect that dram products produced by the acquired elpida facilities will constitute over half of our aggregate dram gigabit production in the first quarter of and result in significant increases in dsg and wsg dram sales 
in accounting for the elpida acquisition  elpida inventories were recorded at fair value  based on their estimated future selling prices  estimated costs to complete and other factors  which was approximately million higher than the cost of inventory recorded by elpida prior to the acquisition 
of this amount  approximately million was included in cost of goods sold for and a significant portion of the reminder is expected to be included in costs of goods sold in the first quarter of nand flash we sell a portion of our output of nand flash products to intel through im flash at long term negotiated prices approximating cost 
see operating results by business segments nand solutions group for further detail 
we sell the remainder of our nand flash products to trade customers 
for the year ended percentage change from prior period sales to trade customers net sales average selling prices per gigabit gigabits sold cost per gigabit increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for as compared to were primarily due to improved product and process technologies  increased output available for sale to trade customers due to the restructure of our im flash agreement with intel in april and the ramp up of our fabrication facility in singapore throughout our gross margin percentage on sales of nand flash products for improved from as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices 
manufacturing cost reductions for as compared to reflect improvements in product and process technologies 
increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for as compared to was primarily due to the ramp of the imfs fabrication facility and improved product and process technologies 
the new cost plus supply agreement with intel also contributed to the increase in gigabits sold to trade customers for nor flash sales of nor flash products for declined as compared to primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless products as a result of weakness in demand from certain customers and the continued transition of wireless applications to nand flash products  which led to significant declines in average selling prices 
our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products for improved as compared to primarily due to cost reductions 
sales of nor flash products for declined from primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless nor flash products  as a result of weakness in demand from certain customers and the continued transition of wireless applications to nand flash products that led to significant declines in average selling prices and sales volume 
our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products declined from to primarily due to decreases in average selling prices  inventory write downs and costs of underutilized capacity 
operating expenses and other selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for decreased as compared to primarily due to a reduction in legal costs and lower variable pay costs partially offset by million of consulting  legal and other costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of elpida 
sg a expenses for increased as compared to primarily due to a million contribution to a university program and stock based compensation and other amounts related to the death benefits of our former chief executive officer in we expect that sg a expenses will approximate million to million for the first quarter of  which includes costs from elpida 
research and development r d expenses for increased from primarily due to lower reimbursements from nanya under partnering arrangements offset by lower payroll costs primarily resulting from the suspension of variable pay plans and a lower volume of development wafers processed 
r d expenses for increased from primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed  higher personnel costs associated with increased salary and wage rates and additional headcount for our expanded r d operations  and higher software and materials costs 
as a result of amounts reimbursable from nanya under a dram r d cost sharing arrangement  r d expenses were reduced by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the april  agreements with intel expanded our nand flash r d cost sharing agreement to include certain emerging memory technologies  but did not change the cost sharing percentage 
as a result of amounts reimbursable from intel  r d expenses were reduced by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
effective january   nanya ceased participating in the joint development program 
we expect that r d expenses  net of amounts reimbursable from our r d partners  will be approximately million to million for the first quarter of  which includes costs from elpida 
our process technology r d efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line width process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products 
additional process technology r d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures  the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials 
product design and development efforts include our high density ddr and ddr dram and mobile low power ddr dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multi level and triple level cell technologies  nor flash memory  specialty memory  solid state drives  hybrid memory cubes and other memory technologies and systems

equity in net loss of equity method investees we recognize our share of earnings or losses from these entities under the equity method  generally on a two month lag 
equity in net loss of equity method investees  net of tax  included the following for the year ended inotera other our equity in net income loss of inotera improved for as compared to primarily due to inotera improved operating results as a result of higher average selling prices and lower manufacturing costs 
on may   inotera issued million common shares to nanya and certain of its affiliates in a private placement at a price equal to new taiwan dollars per common share approximately us dollars as of may   which was in excess of our carrying value per share 
as a result of the issuance  our ownership interest decreased from to and we recognized a gain of approximately million in the change in ownership interest does not change our obligation to purchase substantially all of inotera output 
losses in for our other equity method investments were primarily attributable to transform solar pty ltd 
which ceased operations in and has essentially been liquidated

other further discussion of other operating and non operating income and expenses can be found in the following notes contained in item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity plans other operating income expense  net other non operating income expense  net income taxes fair values elpida acquisition the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in the acquisition of elpida is based on estimates using information available at the closing of the acquisition 
we estimated the provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities of elpida as of july  using an in use model  which reflects its value through its use in combination with other assets as a group 
these provisional amounts could change as additional information become available 
these changes could result in material variances between the combined entity future financial results including variances in fair values recorded  as well as expenses associated with these items 
determination of provisional fair values for the assets and liabilities acquired in the elpida acquisition required significant assumptions  estimates and judgments 
many of the measurements involved significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a level measurement as defined in asc changes in assumptions  estimates and judgments could significantly impact the asset and liabilities recorded as well as the gain recognized in the acquisition 
the items involving the most significant assumptions  estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the following property  plant and equipment  including determination of values in a continued use model  deferred tax assets  including projections of future taxable income and tax rates  inventory  including estimated future selling prices  timing of product sales and completion costs for work in process  and debt  including discount rate and timing of payments 
liquidity and capital resources as of cash and equivalents and short term investments bank deposits money market funds corporate bonds government securities commercial paper certificates of deposit asset backed securities long term marketable investments restricted cash current noncurrent included in other noncurrent assets cash and equivalents in the table above included  million held by elpida and its subsidiaries as of august  substantially all of the restricted cash in the table above is held by elpida for its installment payments to its secured and unsecured creditors 
use of cash and equivalents and restricted cash held by elpida is subject to limitations described below 
as a result of the japan proceedings  for so long as such proceedings are continuing  the elpida companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends  loans and advances 
the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies prohibit the elpida companies from paying dividends  including any cash dividends  to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the elpida companies installment payments 
these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the elpida companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the elpida companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization 
in addition  pursuant to an order of the japan court  the elpida companies cannot make loans or advances  other than certain ordinary course advances  to us without the consent of the japan court 
moreover  loans or advances by subsidiaries of the elpida companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court 
as a result  the assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries  while available to satisfy the elpida companies installment payments and the other obligations  capital expenditures and other operating needs of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries  are not available for use by us in our other operations 
moreover  certain uses of the assets of the elpida companies  including investments in certain capital expenditures and in rexchip  may require consent of elpida trustees and or the japan court 
see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements acquisition of elpida memory  inc cash and equivalents in the table above included million held by imft as of august  and million as of august  our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by the other member and contractual limitations 
amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations 
as of august    million of our cash and equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries  of which million was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of august   we had  million of cash and equivalents  including the  million at elpida  that was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the us would subject these funds to us federal income taxes 
to mitigate credit risk  we invest through high credit quality financial institutions and  by policy  generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor 
cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity 
our liquidity is highly dependent on selling prices for our products and the timing and level of our capital expenditures  both of which can vary significantly from period to period 
depending on conditions in the semiconductor memory market  our cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash and investments may not be adequate to meet our needs for capital expenditures and operations 
in we obtained  million of proceeds from issuance of debt and million of proceeds from equipment sale leaseback financing 
as of august   we had credit facilities available that provides for up to million of additional financing  subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements debt revolving credit facilities 
we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments  including debt incurred in connection with asset backed financing 
we expect our cash and investments  cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through holders of our outstanding convertible notes can convert the notes during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than of the conversion price 
as of august   convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of  million  contained contractual terms that require us to pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes upon conversion 
these notes become convertible at the option of the holders if the closing price of our common stock for the required periods is above prices ranging from to 
none of these convertible notes met the conversion criteria through the calendar quarter ended june  of the notes that require us to pay cash up to the principal amount upon conversion  only the a and b notes  with an aggregate principle amount of million and carrying value of million as of august   met the conversion criteria during september through october   none of the a or b notes had been converted by holders 
we do not believe the amounts converted  if any  would be significant since the note holders would forgo the time value of the embedded conversion option 
we may elect in future periods to redeem convertible notes eligible for redemption 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million for  which reflected approximately  million generated from the production and sales of our products net of a million effect from increases in the amount invested in net working capital 
the increase in net working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million as a result of increases in sales activities 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities was  million for  which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of  million for property  plant and equipment  million for the acquisition of available for sale securities net of proceeds from sales and maturities of million  and million for the settlement of hedging activities net of proceeds from the settlement of hedging activities of million 
we believe that to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies  facilities and capital equipment and r d 
we estimate that capital spending for will be approximately billion to billion 
the actual amounts for will vary depending on market conditions

elpida memory  inc on july   we completed the acquisition of elpida and rexchip and made payments at the closing date of approximately million and million  respectively 
substantially all of the million we paid in connection with the acquisition of elpida was deposited into accounts that are legally restricted for payment to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in october under their plans of reorganizations  the elpida companies are to make additional annual installment payments aggregating billion yen or the equivalent of approximately billion  which are scheduled to occur from through in order to further the planned technology road maps for the elpida and rexchip operations  we will be required to make capital expenditures 
pursuant to the sponsor agreement we agreed  subject to certain conditions  to provide certain support to elpida with respect to obtaining financing for working capital purposes and capital expenditures 
under the sponsor agreement  we agreed  subject to certain conditions  to use reasonable best efforts to assist the elpida companies in financing up to billion yen or the equivalent of approximately million of eligible capital expenditures incurred through june   which may include us providing payment guarantees of third party financing under certain circumstances or direct financial support from micron technology  inc or one of its subsidiaries

any future redemption or conversion of convertible debt could impact our cash payments 
amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  including million for the short term portion of these long term liabilities 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions  therefore  million of long term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table 
however  long term income taxes payable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions 
the obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt 
the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services  market prices  changes to agreed upon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations 
purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria they are noncancellable  we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled  or we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services take or pay 
if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancellable  the entire value of the contract was included in the above table 
if the obligation is cancellable  but we would incur a penalty if canceled  the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation 
contracted minimum amounts specified in take or pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 
on january   we entered into a new supply agreement with nanya and inotera the inotera supply agreement  retroactively effective beginning on january  under the inotera supply agreement  we are obligated to purchase for an initial three year term substantially all of inotera output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components 
the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one year extensions and if in any year the parties do not agree to an extension  the agreement will terminate following the end of the then existing term plus a subsequent three year wind down period 
our share of inotera capacity would decline over the three year wind down period 
we purchased  million of dram products from inotera in under the inotera supply agreement and a prior supply agreement with inotera 
the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity as quantities are based on qualified production output and pricing fluctuates as it is based on market prices 
therefore  we did not include our obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
business acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired  which involves a number of judgments  assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized 
accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred 
we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values  including assistance in determining future cash flows  appropriate discount rates and comparable market values 
the items involving the most significant assumptions  estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the following property  plant and equipment  including determination of values in a continued use model  deferred tax assets  including projections of future taxable income and tax rates  inventory  including estimated future selling prices  timing of product sales and completion costs for work in process  and debt  including discount rate and timing of payments 
consolidations we have interests in joint venture entities that are variable interest entities vies 
determining whether to consolidate a vie may require judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entity primary beneficiary 
to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we evaluate whether we have a the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology  product supply  operations services  equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances 
our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies 
an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 
income taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap  which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value 
cost includes labor  material and overhead costs  including product and process technology costs 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories 
to project average selling prices and sales volumes  we review recent sales volumes  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analyses of supply and demand  seasonal factors  general economic trends and other information 
when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs  we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold 
differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write down recorded 
for example  a variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately million as of august  due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry  actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and  as a result  the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 
us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values 
the amount of any inventory write down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories 
our inventories have been generally categorized as dram  nand flash and nor flash memory 
the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 
property  plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property  plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as r d as incurred 
determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us 
we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability 
subsequent to product qualification  product costs are valued in inventory 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straight line amortization method over the requisite service period 
for performance based stock awards  the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved 
we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time 
a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock 
recently issued accounting standards there have been no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio 
substantially all of our indebtedness was at fixed interest rates 
as a result  the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates 
we estimate that  as of august  and august   a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of would increase the fair value of our convertible notes and other notes by approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense caused by a increase in the interest rates of our variable rate note would not be significant 
as of august  and august   we held debt securities of million and million  respectively  that were subject to interest rate risk 
we estimate that a increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately million as of august  and million as of august  foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in item a 
risk factors 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar 
as a result of our foreign operations  we incur costs and carry certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar  however  significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies  primarily the euro  the shekel  the yen and the yuan 
we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates 
we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities  we utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that generally mature within days 
based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities  offset by balance sheet hedges  we estimate that a adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately us million as of august  and us million as of august  to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and forecasted operating cash flows  we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within months and currency options that generally mature from to months 
under the terms and conditions of the elpida companies respective plans of reorganization  the elpida companies are obligated to pay billion yen or the equivalent of billion based on exchange rates as of august   less certain expenses of their reorganization proceedings and certain other items  to the secured and unsecured creditors the elpida creditor installment payments in respect of the elpida companies pre petition creditors and their related claims 
substantially all of the million we paid in connection with the acquisition of elpida was deposited into accounts that are legally restricted for payment to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in october the remaining billion yen is due in six annual installments payable at the end of each calendar year beginning in  with payments of billion yen in each of through  and payments of billion yen in each of and to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on the payments due in and  we entered into forward contracts to purchase billion yen on november  and billion yen on november  in addition  the elpida companies cash and equivalent balances in yen mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk associated with the yen remaining installment payments due in and after
