item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
overview on an equivalent basis  our production in increased by from we produced bcfe  or mmcfe per day  in  compared to bcfe  or mmcfe per day  in natural gas production increased by bcf  or  to bcf in compared to bcf in this increase was primarily the result of increased production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and continued expansion of infrastructure in the area 
partially offsetting the production increase in the marcellus shale was the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies in the fourth quarter of along with decreases in production primarily in texas  oklahoma and west virginia due to a shift from natural gas to liquids drilling and normal production declines 
crude oil condensate ngl production increased by mbbls  or  from  mbbls in to  mbbls in this increase was primarily the result of increased production resulting from our eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma 
our financial results depend on many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil  and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
our average realized natural gas price for was per mcf  lower than the per mcf price realized in our average realized crude oil price for was per bbl  higher than the per bbl price realized in these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives 
for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices  refer to results of operations in item commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile  and we expect them to remain volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  ngl and crude oil prices and  therefore  we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes or future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
see risk factors natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item a 
we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells with a success rate of in our total capital and exploration spending was million compared to million in this increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded marcellus shale horizontal drilling program in northeast pennsylvania  the eagle ford shale in south texas  including a portion towards the pearsall shale  and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma 
in both and  we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations  availability of services and human resources 
we plan to continue such method of allocation in our drilling program includes between million and billion in capital and exploration expenditures 
funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow  existing cash and  if required  borrowings under our credit facility 

table of contents financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations  proceeds from the sales of certain oil and gas properties and other assets during the year and borrowings under our credit facility 
these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures  in addition to repayments of debt and related interest  final contributions to fund the liquidation of our pension plan and dividends 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses 
prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile  including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years 
in addition  fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues 
our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above 
from time to time  our working capital will reflect a surplus  while at other times it will reflect a deficit 
this fluctuation is not unusual 
we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 
year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million over this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses excluding non cash expenses 
this increase was partially offset by changes in working capital and long term assets and liabilities 
the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices 
equivalent production volumes increased by for compared to as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production 
average realized natural gas prices decreased by for compared to  while average realized crude oil prices increased by compared to the same period 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million over this increase was primarily due to increased operating income in as a result of higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses excluding non cash expenses 
this increase was offset by changes in working capital which decreased operating cash flows 
the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices 
equivalent production volumes increased by in compared to primarily due to higher natural gas and crude oil production 
average realized natural gas prices decreased by in compared to and average realized crude oil prices decreased by over the same period 

table of contents see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price  production and operating expense movements 
we are unable to predict future commodity prices and  as a result  cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
realized prices may decline in future periods 
investing activities the primary use of cash in investing activities was capital and exploration expenditures 
we established our budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices and cash flows 
due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise  our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year 
cash flows used in investing activities increased by million from to and decreased by million from to the increase from to was due to a decrease of million of proceeds from the sale of assets  an increase of million in capital and exploration expenditures and an increase of million associated with our equity investment in constitution 
the decrease from to was due to an increase of million of proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by an increase of million in capital and exploration expenditures 
financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from to this was primarily due to million of higher net borrowings million increase in borrowings and million decrease in repayment of debt  partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of million and cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of million 
cash flows used in financing activities increased by million from to this was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of million  partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of million 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of compared to million of borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of at december  as of december   we had million available for future borrowings under our credit facility 
in may  we amended our credit facility to adjust the margins associated with borrowings under the facility and extended the maturity date from september to may the credit facility  as amended  provides for an available credit line of million and contains a million accordion feature whereby we may increase the available credit line to billion  if one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount 
as of december   the borrowing base under our amended credit facility was billion 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity 
our credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt 
management believes that  with internally generated cash flow  existing cash on hand and availability under our credit facility  we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position 

table of contents capitalization information about our capitalization is as follows december  dollars in thousands debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization cash and cash equivalents includes million of current portion of long term debt at december  and million and million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends of million per share on our common stock 
a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration expenditures  excluding any significant property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations and  when necessary  borrowings under our credit facility 
we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures year ended december  in thousands capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions acquisitions pipeline and gathering other exploration expense total we plan to drill approximately to gross wells to net in compared to gross wells net drilled in this drilling program includes between approximately million and billion in total capital and exploration expenditures excluding expected contributions of approximately million to constitution  compared to million in we expect our capital spending in to be consistent with that of based on our estimate of natural gas and crude oil prices over the next year 
we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

table of contents contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  are set forth in the following table payments due by year in thousands total to to beyond long term debt interest on long term debt transportation agreements drilling rig commitments operating leases equity investment contribution commitments total contractual obligations interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our billion long term debt outstanding  including current maturities  at december  interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december  outstanding balance of million will be outstanding through the may maturity date 
a constant interest rate of was assumed  which was the december  weighted average interest rate 
actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for further information on our obligations under transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments and operating leases  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on our equity investment contribution commitment  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures 
the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december  was million 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
our most significant policies are discussed below 
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed 
development costs  including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

table of contents oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices 
additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller lents  independent petroleum engineers  who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate 
for more information regarding reserve estimation  including historical reserve revisions  refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item our rate of recording dd a expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves  which are utilized in our unit of production calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields 
a positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of per mcfe and an increase of per mcfe  respectively  on our dd a rate 
revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd a rate 
it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of per mcfe and an increase of per mcfe  respectively  on our total dd a rate 
these estimated impacts are based on current data  and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd a rate 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards 
due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process  risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis  management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset 
if the future undiscounted expected cash flows  based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices  operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves also potentially including risk adjusted probable and possible reserves from time to time are lower than the net book value of the asset  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process  historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials  as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices 
in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline  there could be a significant revision in the future 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows 
the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil 
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience  our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property 
table of contents lives 
average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights 
historically  the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years 
the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling 
we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage  especially in exploratory areas 
if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year  the amortization would increase by approximately million or decrease by approximately million  respectively  per year 
as these properties are developed and reserves are proven  the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful  the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made 
the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 
asset retirement obligation the majority of our asset retirement obligation aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations  pipelines  processing plants and compressors 
we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs  timing of settlements  inflation rates and discount rate 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement  the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life  while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under applicable accounting standards  the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each quarterly period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective 
the ineffective portion  if any  of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties 
such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil  basis differentials  volatility factors and interest rates  such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term  as applicable 
these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness 
the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non performance risk 
we measure the non performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions  while our non performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

table of contents employee benefit plans our costs of long term employee benefits  particularly postretirement benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties 
it also is management responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our employee benefit plans 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liability classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
to calculate fair value  we use either a binomial or black scholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award 
the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life  volatility and other factors 
stock based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the amendments in this update require enhanced disclosures around financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in accordance with either asc or asc or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement  irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either asc or asc an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after january  this guidance will primarily impact our disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives 
we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the amendments in this update clarify that the scope of asu applies to derivatives accounted for in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  including bifurcated embedded derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with asc or asc or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after january  this guidance will primarily impact our disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives 
we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents other issues and contingencies regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production  natural gas marketing  gathering and transportation  federal regulation of petroleum  pipeline safety regulation  and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of to our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of to at december   we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and senior notes 
in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 
operating risks and insurance coverage 
our business involves a variety of operating risks 
see risk factors we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item a 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil 
declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically 
historically  natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our long lived assets 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results 
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the related commodity index declines  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue 
under both arrangements  there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 
results of operations and compared we reported net income for of million  or per share  compared to net income for of million  or per share 
the increase in net income was primarily due to an

contributing to the increase are higher employee related and lease maintenance costs  partially offset by lower workover costs 
transportation and gathering increased by million primarily due higher throughput due to an increase in production and higher transportation rates  coupled with the commencement of various transportation and gathering arrangements in late and throughout  primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas 
brokered natural gas decreased by million from to see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis 
taxes other than income increased million primarily due to additional costs associated with the passage of an impact fee in pennsylvania on marcellus shale production that was imposed by state legislature in february and higher production tax expense due to fewer production tax refunds and credits received in compared to exploration increased million primarily due to an increase in exploration expense as the result of increased activity  partially offset by lower geophysical and geological costs due to fewer acquisitions and purchases of seismic data 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million  with a million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes partially offset by an million decrease due to a lower dd a rate 
this increase was offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of million as a result of a decrease in amortization rates due to the success of our drilling programs in pennsylvania and south texas and the sale of certain pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in the second quarter of 
table of contents general and administrative increased by million primarily due to million higher pension expense associated with the termination of our qualified pension plan and the related settlement that occurred in the second quarter  and higher legal costs and professional fees of million

contributing to the increase are higher workover and environmental and regulatory costs associated with the remediation of certain wells in northeast pennsylvania as a result of the padep consent order and settlement agreement 
offsetting these increases were lower lease maintenance  subsurface lease maintenance and plugging and abandonment costs in compared to coupled with lower compression expenses primarily due to the sale of our gathering system in northeast pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of transportation and gathering increased by million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in  primarily in northeast pennsylvania 
brokered natural gas decreased by million from to see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas for further analysis 
taxes other than income decreased million due to decreased production taxes as a result of tax refunds and credits received in on qualifying wells  lower ad valorem tax expense due to lower natural gas prices and property values and lower franchise tax expense 
exploration decreased million due to lower geological and geophysical costs primarily due to a reduction in the acquisition of seismic data  partially offset by higher dry hole costs in related to an exploratory dry hole in montana 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million  of which million was due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes offset by a lower dd a rate and a million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligations 
the increase in depreciation and depletion was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of million primarily due to a decrease in amortization rates due to a shift in our drilling and development activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices 
realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and market prices for north american natural gas production 
commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable 
derivative instruments and hedging activity our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection 
these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices  but offer protection in the event of price declines 
further  if our counterparties defaulted  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the 
table of contents hedges 
please read the discussion below as well as note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
periodically  we enter into commodity derivative instruments  including collar and swap agreements  to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks 
all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes 
under the collar agreements  if the index price rises above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
if the index price falls below the floor price  the counterparty pays us 
under the swap agreements  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures

 the amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain loss column in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december  and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk 
nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions  while our non performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 
during  natural gas and crude oil swaps covered bcf  or  and  mbbl  or  of natural gas and crude oil production at an average price of per mcf and per bbl  respectively 
natural gas basis swaps covered bcf  or  of our natural gas production at an average price of per mcf 
natural gas collars with a floor price of per mcf and a ceiling price of per mcf covered bcf  or  of our natural gas production at an average price of per mcf 
we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 
although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements  the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non performance by third parties are substantially smaller 
we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to non performance by third parties 
our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of america  bank of montreal  goldman sachs  jpmorgan and morgan stanley 

table of contents fair market value of other financial instruments the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties 
the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short term maturities of these instruments 
the fair value of long term debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt  including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate 
the credit spread is our default or repayment risk 
the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixed rate notes and credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt 
the fair value of all of the fixed rate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 
we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt
