recent legislative developments the principal federal law enacted since the start of the financial crisis that attempts to deal with the causes of that crisis is the dodd frank act 
it significantly affects all financial institutions  including arrow and our banks 
there are other earlier enacted banking laws that continue to significantly impact our operations 
the dodd frank act and these other statutes are discussed briefly below 
the dodd frank act as a result of the financial crisis  the us congress passed and the president signed the dodd frank act on july  while many of the act provisions have not had and likely will not have any direct impact on arrow  other provisions have impacted or likely will impact our business operations and financial results in a significant way 
these include the establishment of a new regulatory body known as the bureau of consumer financial protection  which will operate as an independent entity within the federal reserve system and is authorized to issue rules for consumer protection  some of which likely will significantly increase banks compliance expenses  thereby reducing or restraining profitability 
for depository institutions with billion or less in assets such as arrow banks  the banks traditional regulatory agencies for our banks  the occ  and not the bureau  will have primary examination and enforcement authority over the banks compliance with new bureau rules as well as all other consumer protection rules and regulations 
however  the bureau will have the right to include its examiners on a sampling basis in examinations conducted by the traditional regulators and will be authorized to give those agencies input and recommendations with respect to consumer protection laws and to require reports and other examination documents 
the bureau will have broad authority to curb practices it finds to be unfair  deceptive and abusive 
what constitutes abusive behavior has been broadly defined and is very likely to create an environment conducive to increased litigation 
this is likely to be exacerbated by the fact that  in addition to the federal authorities charged with enforcing the bureau rules  state attorneys general are also authorized to enforce those federal consumer laws transferred to the bureau and the rules issued by the bureau thereunder 
dodd frank also directs the federal banking authorities to issue new capital requirements for banks and holding companies which must be at least as strict as the pre existing capital requirements for depository institutions and may be much more onerous 
see the discussion under important proposed changes to regulatory capital standards on page of this report 
dodd frank also provided that any new issuances of trust preferred securities trups by bank holding companies having between million and billion in assets such as arrow will no longer be able to qualify as tier capital  although previously issued and outstanding trups of such bank holding companies  including arrow million of trups that are currently outstanding  will continue to qualify as tier capital 
however  if the proposed new capital rules to be jointly issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies were to be issued in the form as proposed in june  even these grandfathered trups previously issued by small to mid sized financial institutions like arrow would be phased out from qualifying as tier capital  at a rate of per year beginning in we as well as other community and regional banks would be adversely affected by this particular treatment  which is more severe in its impact on the capital of affected banks like ours than is required under dodd frank 
in any event  trups  which have been an important financing tool for community banks such as ours  can no longer be counted on as a viable source of new capital 
many of the regulations required to be promulgated by bank regulators in order to give effect to dodd frank provisions have yet to be promulgated or are pending final approval by the regulators  and will have phase in periods even after final promulgation 
the following is a summary of some additional dodd frank provisions that are likely to have a material impact  positive or negative  as the case may be  on us and our customers increase of fdic deposit insurance to  per customer made permanent by statute 
the fdic insurance assessment on banks is now asset based  not deposit based  which actually reduces insurance costs for most small to mid sized institutions  like arrow 
under the new method  our premiums were reduced from thousand of fdic and fico assessments for the first quarter of the last quarter under the old deposit based method of assessment  to thousand of expense for the second quarter of under the new asset based method  a decline of 
new limitations imposed by dodd frank on debit card interchange fees  which technically apply only to the very large banks having more than billion in assets  have already had and likely will continue to have a negative impact on the fee income of smaller banks like ours  due to competitive pressures 
requirements for mortgage originators to act in the best interests of a consumer and to seek to ensure that a consumer will have the capacity to repay any consumer loan 
requirements for comprehensive additional residential mortgage loan related disclosures 
statutory implementation of source of strength doctrine for both bank and savings and loan holding companies  under which the federal reserve can compel a holding company to contribute additional capital to its subsidiary depository institutions 
limitation of current federal preemption standards for national banks such as our banks  that is  the act reduces the extent to which state law is preempted by federal law with regard to the operation of national banks 
this increases the potential for state intervention in the operations of national banks 
repeal of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
full implementation of the dodd frank act will result in many new mandatory and discretionary rulemakings by numerous federal regulatory agencies 
this rulemaking will continue for several more years 
as a result  bank holding companies are facing thousands of new pages of regulations  not to mention increased litigation risk 
additional required rules still in the formulation process that may significantly impact our operations include those related to short term borrowing disclosures  and disclosures regarding executive compensation 
several of these issues are highly controversial  and the implementing regulations to be forthcoming remain the focus of much discussion and concern 
other recent federal laws affecting banks federal laws enacted in addressing the financial crisis included the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa and the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra and related governmental programs 
these laws established emergency capital and liquidity support programs which enabled many major financial institutions to survive the crisis 
such program served their purpose and have largely been superseded by subsequent statutory and regulatory measures  principally dodd frank 
we did not participate  or need to participate in any of the emergency capital or liquidity support programs 
the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of became effective october  the act addressed many areas of bankruptcy practice  including consumer bankruptcy  general and small business bankruptcy  treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy  ancillary and cross border cases  financial contract protection amendments to chapter governing family farmer reorganization  and special protection for patients of a health care business filing for bankruptcy 
this act did not have a significant impact on our earnings or on our efforts to recover collateral on secured loans 
the sarbanes oxley act  signed into law on july   adopted a number of measures having a significant impact on all publicly traded companies  including arrow 
generally  the act sought to improve the quality of financial reporting of these companies by compelling them to adopt good corporate governance practices and by strengthening the independence of their auditors 
the act placed substantial additional duties on directors  officers  auditors and attorneys of public companies 
among other specific measures  the act required that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify to the sec in the holding company annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec regarding the accuracy of its financial statements contained therein and the integrity of its internal controls 
the act also accelerated insiders reporting requirements for transactions in company securities  restricted certain executive officer and director transactions  imposed obligations on corporate audit committees  and provided for enhanced review of company filings by the sec 
as part of the general effort to improve public company auditing  the act places limits on consulting services that may be performed by a company independent auditors by requiring that the company audit committee of the board of directors evaluate amounts to determine independence 
the act created a federal public company accounting oversight board the pcaob to set auditing standards  inspect registered public accounting firms  and exercise enforcement powers  subject to oversight by the sec 
in the wake of the sarbanes oxley act  the nation stock exchanges  including the exchange on which arrow stock is listed  the national association of securities dealers  inc nasd promulgated a wide array of governance standards that must be followed by listed companies 
the nasd standards include having a board of directors the majority of whose members are independent of management  and having audit  compensation and nomination committees of the board consisting exclusively of independent directors 
we have implemented a variety of corporate governance measures and procedures to comply with sarbanes oxley and the amended nasd listing requirements  although we have always relied on a board of directors a majority of whose members are independent and independent board committees to make important decisions regarding the company 
the usa patriot act initially adopted in and re adopted by the us congress in with certain changes the patriot act  imposes substantial record keeping and due diligence obligations on banks and other financial institutions  with a particular focus on detecting and reporting money laundering transactions involving domestic or international customers 
the us treasury department has issued and will continue to issue regulations clarifying the patriot act requirements 
the patriot act requires all financial institutions  including banks  to maintain certain anti money laundering compliance and due diligence programs 
the provisions of the act impose substantial costs on all financial institutions  including ours 
recent changes in deposit insurance laws and regulations although the dodd frank act extended the unlimited fdic deposit insurance coverage that had been previously established by fdic rule for non interest bearing transaction accounts such as certain checking accounts  this unlimited deposit insurance coverage terminated by statute on december  consequently  as of january   funds held in non interest bearing transaction accounts at arrow banks no longer have unlimited deposit insurance coverage  but are subject to standard fdic deposit insurance rules 
the fdic collects insurance premiums on insured deposits 
in recent years  the fdic has made several modifications to its deposit insurance premium structure  the most important of which was to calibrate premiums based on the total assets versus total deposits of insured institutions 
this has tended to benefit smaller regional banks such as ours  that typically maintain a higher ratio of deposits to total assets than the large  money center banks 
in  after a several year period in which banks were charged no or very low premiums for deposit insurance  the fdic resumed charging financial institutions an fdic deposit insurance premium  under a new risk based assessment system 
under this system  institutions in risk category i the lowest of four risk categories paid a rate based on a formula of to cents per of assessable deposits 
in  in response to a growing level of claims against the bank insurance fund  resulting from the first stages of the financial crisis  the fdic announced that it would raise the lowest rate from cents to cents per of assessable deposits  which increase remained in effect through in addition  beginning with the second quarter of  the fdic added four new factors to the assessment rate calculation  including factors for brokered deposits  secured liabilities and unsecured liabilities 
in  in light of extraordinary demands on the fdic insurance fund  the fdic imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions  including our banks  at 
of total assets as adjusted for tier capital 
we charged thousand to earnings in the second quarter of for this assessment  which was paid on september  in the fourth quarter of  the fdic collected prepaid assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and our prepaid assessment amounted to million 
the expense was ratably recorded over the respective periods as directed by the fdic 
in february of  the fdic finalized a new assessment system that took effect in the second quarter of the final rule changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity  adopted a new large bank pricing assessment scheme  and set a target size for the deposit insurance fund the successor to the bank insurance fund 
the changes went into effect in the second quarter of the rule as mandated by dodd frank finalizes a target size for the deposit insurance fund at of insured deposits 
it also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the fund reaches so that the average rate over time should be about basis points and  in lieu of dividends  provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches and 
also as mandated by dodd frank  the rule changes the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a bank average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
the new assessment system significantly lowered our fdic insurance assessments in second quarter of  which decreased by over from the first quarter of we are unable to predict whether or to what extent the fdic may elect to impose additional special assessments on insured institutions in upcoming years  although it is commonly understood that the fdic insurance fund may not be adequate if bank failures continue at significant levels for any significant period of time and or the cost to the fdic of the bank failures recently resolved by it should prove even greater than was initially anticipated

competition we face intense competition in all markets we serve 
traditional competitors are other local commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan institutions and credit unions  as well as local offices of major regional and money center banks 
like all banks  we encounter strong competition in mortgage lending from a wide variety of other mortgage originators  all of whom are principally affected in this business by the rate and terms set  and the lending practices established by the very large government sponsored enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac  who purchase and or guarantee a very substantial dollar amount and number of mortgage loans  which in accounted for a large majority of the total amount of mortgage loans extended in the us additionally  non banking financial organizations  such as consumer finance companies  insurance companies  securities firms  money market  mutual funds and credit card companies offer substantive equivalents of the various other types of loan and financial products and transactional accounts that we offer  even though these non banking organizations are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and capital requirements that apply to us 
under federal banking laws  such non banking financial organizations not only may offer products comparable to those offered by commercial banks  but also may establish or acquire their own commercial banks

risk factors our financial results and the market price of our stock in future periods are subject to risks arising from many factors  including the following please note that the discussions below regarding potential impact on arrow of certain of these factors that may develop in the future are not meant to provide predictions by arrow management that such factors will develop  but to acknowledge the possible impact that could occur if the factors do develop 
difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial services industry 
for many financial institutions  dramatic declines in the us housing market over the past three years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values 
to date  the impact of these adverse market conditions has been less significant on arrow than it has been on many other us financial institutions 
write downs at many of these other institutions  initially of asset backed securities but spreading to other securities and loans  have caused a number of those institutions to seek additional capital  to reduce or eliminate dividends  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
generally  in the financial services sector  this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies at many institutions  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity 
although this turmoil has affected arrow and our local markets less than certain other institutions and markets  the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already  to some extent  adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
market developments may continue to negatively affect consumer confidence levels and demand for loans  and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may increase our charge offs and provision for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on arrow and others in the financial institutions industry 
we may be adversely affected by new and enhanced government regulation  especially the new rules promulgated under the dodd frank act 
even before the recent financial crisis and the new banking laws and regulations resulting therefrom  including the dodd frank act  we were subject to extensive federal and state banking regulations and supervision 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect our depositors funds and the federal deposit insurance funds  not the company shareholders 
regulatory requirements affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in the imposition of limitations on our operations that would adversely impact our profitability and could  if capital levels dropped significantly  result in our being required to cease or scale back our operations or raise capital at inopportune times or unsatisfactory prices 
on top of the preexisting regulatory structure  the recent changes in governing law  regulations and regulatory practices have already imposed  and likely will continue to impose  substantial additional costs on us and thereby hurt our revenues and profitability 
dodd frank has already required us to adopt substantial additional practices and procedures in the normal day to day operation of our business  and many of the new and most onerous rules and regulations required by dodd frank  including new capital requirements that may be substantially enhanced from the current requirements  have not yet been implemented or in some cases even proposed 
in many case  even the general structure of the new regulations required to be issued under dodd frank is unclear 
this uncertainty is a concern 
at this time  it is difficult to predict the extent to which dodd frank or the resulting regulations and rules may adversely impact the company 
it is reasonably certain  however  that dodd frank will increase our costs  require us to modify certain strategies and business operations  and require us to revise our capital and liquidity structures  which  individually or collectively  may very well have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
if economic conditions  already weak  should worsen and the us experiences a recession or prolonged economic stagnation  the company allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable loan losses at the balance sheet date 
our allowance for loan losses is based on our historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with our loan portfolio  including the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio and other factors 
if the economy in our geographic market area  the northeastern region of new york state  or in the us generally  should deteriorate to the point that recessionary conditions return  or if the regional or national economy experiences a protracted period of stagnation  the quality of our loan portfolio may weaken significantly 
if so  our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses  and future enhanced provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect financial results 
moreover  weak or worsening economic conditions often lead to difficulties in other areas of our business  including growth of our business generally  thereby compounding the negative effects on earnings 
a sustained and or significant change in domestic interest rates could negatively affect the company net interest income 
an institution net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest  including short term and long term rates and the relationship between the two 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies such as the federal reserve board  and actions taken by foreign central banks 
like all financial institutions  the company balance sheet is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
although both short and long term interest rates have remained at very low levels for the past several years  and the federal reserve has recently announced that its goal is to keep rates in the us at these low levels at least through  there is a widespread concern that the rapid growth in the money supply  another development actively promoted by the federal reserve and other central banks in the western world  will eventually lead to a surge in inflation in the us and other developed nations  including in the cost of borrowed funds ie  interest rates 
any such development ie  a rising rate environment in the ie may negatively affect banks profitability 
see the discussion under changes in net interest income due to rate  on page of this report 
if economic conditions worsen significantly and the us financial markets should suffer another downturn  the company may experience limited access to credit markets 
as discussed under part i  item d liquidity  the company has relationships with various third parties to provide overnight and longer term credit arrangements 
if and as these third parties may themselves have difficulty in accessing their own credit markets  we may  in turn  experience a decrease in our capacity to borrow funds from them or other third parties traditionally relied upon by banks for liquidity 
if the value of real estate in our market area were to suffer an additional material decline  a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  which might have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition to considering the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of borrowers  we often secure loans with real estate collateral  which in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower 
if mortgaged real property deteriorates in value significantly during the time the credit is outstanding and we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt  our earnings and capital could be adversely affected 
furthermore  the possibility of legislative changes at the federal or state level adversely impacting the ability of banks to protect themselves when loans begin to go bad  including through foreclosure proceedings  may result in negative impacts to those institutions 
if securities prices should significantly decline in upcoming periods  we likely will experience a reduction in income from fiduciary activities 
the most significant portion of the income we earn from managing assets in our fiduciary capacity is tied to the market value of those assets  ie  investment securities 
if stocks or other equity securities lose market value  in a sudden market crash as was experienced in  we may see our fiduciary income substantially reduced 
we are subject to the local economies where we operate  and unfavorable economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends upon the growth in business activity  income levels and deposits in our geographic market area 
unpredictable and unfavorable economic conditions unique to our market area may have an adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio and financial performance 
as a community bank  we are less able than our larger regional competitors to spread the risk of unfavorable local economic conditions over a larger market area 
although our market area northeastern new york state has not been as severely damaged by the financial downturn of the past three years as many other areas of the us  this could change in future periods if the us economy generally continues to suffer 
moreover  we cannot give any assurances that we  as a single enterprise  will benefit from any unique and favorable economic conditions in our market area  even if they do occur 
current levels of market volatility 
the market for certain investment securities  including mortgage backed securities  has been highly volatile or inactive  and may not stabilize or resume in the near future 
this volatility can result in significant fluctuation in the prices of those securities  some of which we hold in our investment portfolio  which could affect the results of our operations 
changes in accounting standards may materially impact the company financial statements 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board fasb changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in changes to previously reported financial statements 
specifically  changes in the fair value of our financial assets could have a significant negative impact on our asset portfolios and indirectly on our capital levels the company business could suffer if it loses key personnel unexpectedly 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain our key personnel for the duration of their expected terms of service 
however  back up plans are also important  in the event key personnel are unexpectedly rendered incapable of performing or depart or resign from their positions 
while our board of directors actively reviews emergency staffing plans  any sudden unexpected change at the senior management level may adversely affect our business 
the company relies on other companies to provide key components of the company business infrastructure 
third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections  network access and mutual fund distribution 
these parties are beyond our control  and any problems caused or experienced by these third parties  including their not being able to continue to provide their services to us or performing such services poorly  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and conduct our business 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect arrow 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
arrow has exposure to many different counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  other commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other financial institutions 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  could lead to market wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by arrow or by other institutions and organizations 
many of these transactions expose arrow to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  arrow credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by arrow cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due arrow 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the company faces continuing and growing security risks to its own information base and to information on its customers 
arrow has implemented systems of internal controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures intended to protect its business operations 
in addition  we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs 
no matter how well designed or implemented our controls are  we cannot provide an absolute guarantee to protect business operations from every type of problem in every situation 
a failure or circumvention of these controls could have a material adverse effect on arrow business operations and financial condition 
also the computer systems and network infrastructure that we use are always vulnerable to unforeseen disruptions  including theft of confidential customer information identity theft and interruption of service as a result of fire  natural disasters  explosion  general infrastructure failure or cyber attacks 
these disruptions may arise in our internally developed systems  the systems of our third party service providers or originating from our consumer and business customers who access our systems from their own networks or digital devices to process transactions 
information security risks have increased significantly in recent years because of consumer demand to use the internet and other electronic delivery channels to conduct financial transactions 
this risk is further enhanced due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime  hackers  terrorists and other disreputable parties 
we regularly assess and attempt to improve our security systems and disaster preparedness  including back up systems  but the risks are substantially escalating 
as a result  cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems  data and networks from attacks or unauthorized access remain a priority 
accordingly  we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures 
such costs or losses could exceed the amount of insurance coverage  if any  which would adversely affect our earnings 
our industry is faced with technological advances and changes on a continuing basis  and failure to adapt to these advances and changes could have a material adverse impact on our business 
technological advances and changes in the financial services industry are pervasive and constant factors 
for our business to remain competitive  we must comprehend developments in new products  services and delivery systems utilizing new technology and adapt to those developments 
proper implementation of new technology can increase efficiency  decrease costs and help to meet customer demand 
however  many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technological advances and changes 
we may not always be successful in utilizing the latest technological advances in offering our products and services or in otherwise conducting our business 
failure to identify  adapt to and implement technological advances and changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stock price may begin to reflect market volatility more closely than it has in the past 
our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors  including actual or anticipated variations in our operating results  recommendations by securities analysts  significant acquisitions or business combinations  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  new technology used or services offered by our competitors  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  and changes in government regulations 
many of these factors that may adversely affect our stock price are less reflective of our particular condition or operating results than general market fluctuations  industry wide factors or general economic or political conditions and events  including terrorist attacks  economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes  credit loss trends or currency fluctuations

there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies the allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may make it difficult for borrowers to meet their contractual obligations 
any downward trend in the economy  regional or national  may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition at the same time that other areas of our operations  including new loan originations and assets under administration in our trust department may also be experiencing negative pressures from the same underlying negative economic conditions 
liabilities for retirement plans we have a variety of pension and retirement plans 
liabilities under these plans rely on estimates of future salary increases  numbers of employees and employee retention  discount rates and long term rates of return on plan investments 
changes in these assumptions due to changes in the financial markets  the economy  our own operations or applicable law and regulation may result in material changes to our liability for postretirement expense  with consequent impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets accounting standards require a reduction in the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is  in part  based on an estimate of future taxable income 
goodwill accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
an entity may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill or apply a two step impairment analysis 
if  after assessing the qualitative factors  it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we must perform the two step impairment test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
other than temporary decline in the value of debt and equity securities accounting standards require that  for individual securities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity  an enterprise shall determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
when an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the amount of the other than temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or whether or not it is more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss 
if we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
any significant economic downturn might result  and historically have on occasion resulted  in an other than temporary impairment in securities held in our portfolio 
valuation methods for securities most of the securities portfolio  which includes us treasury and agency securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal securities  corporate debt and equity securities are priced using industry standard models that consider various assumptions that include time value  yield curves  volatility factors  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity  current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these assumptions are either observable in the marketplace  derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
municipal and corporate securities are valued using a type of matrix  or grid  pricing in which securities are benchmarked against the treasury rate based on credit rating 
these model and matrix measurements are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the following discussion and analysis focuses on and reviews our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and our financial condition as of december  and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the selected quarterly and annual information set forth above and the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
when necessary  prior year financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
a 
overview summary of financial results we reported net income for of million  representing diluted earnings per share eps of  an increase of two cents  or from our result 
return on average equity roe for the year continued to be strong at  although down from the roe of for the year 
return on average assets roa for continued to be strong at  although down from roa of for both decreases were principally due to our shrinking net interest margin  which led to a slight decrease   in our net interest income  despite the fact that our earning assets grew and our asset quality remained strong 
the decrease in net interest income was more than offset by a increase in our noninterest income 
total assets were billion at december   which represented an increase of million  or  above the billion level at december  stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million or  from the year earlier level 
the components of the change in stockholders equity since year end are presented in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity on page  and are discussed in more detail in the last section of this overview on page entitled  increase in stockholder equity 
regulatory capital at period end  we continue to exceed all current regulatory minimum capital requirements at both the holding company and bank levels  by a substantial amount 
as of december  both of our banks  as well as our holding company  qualified as well capitalized under federal bank regulatory guidelines 
our regulatory capital levels have consistently remained well in excess of required minimums during recent years  despite the economic downturn  because of our continued profitability and strong asset quality 
even if the new enhanced capital requirements as set forth in the june joint bank regulatory release  basel iii notices of proposed rulemaking  were to go into effect as they were proposed  arrow and its banks would meet all of these enhanced standards 
see current regulatory capital standards on page  and important proposed changes to regulatory capital standards on page economic recession and loan quality during the early stages of the economic crisis in late and early  our market area of northeastern new york was relatively sheltered from the widespread collapse in real estate values and general surge in unemployment 
this may have been due  in part  to the fact that our market area had been less affected by the preceding real estate bubble than other areas of the us as the recession became stronger and deeper through late  even northeastern new york began to feel the impact of the worsening national economy reflected in a slow down in regional real estate sales and increasing unemployment rates 
from year end and through most of  we experienced a very modest decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio  although by standard measures our portfolio continued to be significantly stronger than the average for our peer group of us bank holding companies with billion to billion in total assets see page for peer group information 
by year end  however  our loan quality began to stabilize  a trend that continued through during this period  although nonperforming loans increased slightly  charge offs decreased 
nonperforming loans were million at december   an increase of thousand from year end the ratio of nonperforming loans to period end loans at december  was  an increase from 
at december  by way of comparison  this ratio for our peer group was at december   which was a significant improvement for the peer group from its ratio of at year end  but still very high when compared to the group ratio of at december  loans charged off net of recoveries against our allowance for loan losses was a very low thousand for  as compared to thousand for at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  representing of total loans  an decrease of basis points from december  since the onset of the financial crisis in  we have not experienced significant deterioration in any of our three major loan portfolio segments commercial loans these loans comprise approximately of our loan portfolio 
current unemployment rates in our region are higher than in the past few years and the total number of jobs has decreased  but these trends are largely attributable to a scaling back of local operations on the part of a few large corporations having operations in our service area 
commercial property values have not shown significant deterioration 
we update the appraisals on our nonperforming and watched commercial properties as deemed necessary  usually when the loan is downgraded or when we perceive significant market deterioration since our last appraisal 
residential real estate loans these loans  including home equity loans  make up approximately of our portfolio 
we have not experienced a notable increase in our foreclosure rates  primarily due to the fact that we never have originated or participated in underwriting high risk mortgage loans  such as so called alt a  negative amortization  option arm or negative equity loans 
we originate all of the residential real estate loans held in our portfolio and apply conservative underwriting standards to all of our originations 
automobile loans primarily through indirect lending these loans comprise approximately of our loan portfolio 
throughout  and  we did not experience any significant change in our delinquency rate or level of charge offs on these loans  although both delinquencies and charge offs did increase modestly during recent legislative developments i dodd frank act as a result of the financial crisis  the us congress passed and the president signed the dodd frank act on july  while many of the act provisions have not had and likely will not have any direct impact on arrow  other provisions have impacted or likely will impact our business operations and financial results in a significant way 
these include the establishment of a new regulatory body known as the bureau of consumer financial protection 
see the discussion on p 
under the dodd frank act regarding the likely impact on arrow of the bureau of consumer financial protection 
dodd frank also directs the federal banking authorities to issue new capital requirements for banks and holding companies that must be at least as strict as the pre existing capital requirements for depository institutions and may be much more onerous 
see the discussion under important proposed changes to regulatory capital standards on page of this report 
dodd frank also provided that any new issuances of trust preferred securities trups by bank holding companies having between million and billion in assets such as arrow will no longer be able to qualify as tier capital  although previously issued and outstanding trups of such bank holding companies  including arrow million of trups that are currently outstanding  will continue to qualify as tier capital 
however  if the proposed new capital rules jointly issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies in june were to be implemented as proposed  even these grandfathered trups previously issued by small to mid sized financial institutions like arrow would be phased out from qualifying as tier capital  at a rate of per year beginning in we as well as other community and regional banks would be adversely affected by this particular treatment  which is more severe in its impact on the capital of affected banks like ours than is required under dodd frank 
in any event  trups  which have been an important financing tool for community banks such as ours  can no longer be counted on as a viable source of new capital 
see the discussion on p 
under the dodd frank act regarding specific provisions of dodd frank that have had  or are likely to have particular significance to arrow and its banks in their future operations and financial results 
ii health care reform in march  comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was passed under the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the health reform act 
included among the major provisions of the health reform act is a change in tax treatment of the federal drug subsidy paid with respect to eligible retirees 
the statute also contains provisions that may impact the company accounting for some of its benefit plans in future periods 
the exact extent of the health reform act impact  if any  cannot be determined until final regulations are promulgated and interpretations of the health reform act become available 
liquidity and access to credit markets we did not experience any liquidity problems or special concerns during  nor did we during or the terms of our lines of credit with our correspondent banks  the fhlbny and the federal reserve bank have not changed see our general liquidity discussion on page 
in general  we rely on asset based liquidity ie  funds in overnight investments and cash flow from maturing investments and loans with liability based liquidity as a secondary source our main liability based sources are overnight borrowing arrangements with our correspondent banks  term credit arrangement advances from the fhlbny and the federal reserve bank discount window 
during the recent financial crisis  many financial institutions  small and large  relied extensively on the fed discount window to support their liquidity positions  but we did not 
we maintain  and periodically test  a contingent liquidity plan to ensure that we can generate an adequate amount of available funds to meet a wide variety of potential liquidity crises  including a severe crisis 
fdic shift from deposit based to asset based insurance premiums  reduction in premiums the dodd frank act changed the basis on which insured banks would be assessed deposit insurance premiums  which has had a beneficial effect on the rates we pay and our overall premiums 
beginning with the second quarter of  the calculation of regular fdic insurance premiums for insured institutions changed so as to be based on adjusted assets as defined rather than deposits 
this had the effect of imposing fdic insurance fees not only on deposits but on other sources of funding as well  including short term borrowings and repurchase agreements 
the rate  however  given the significantly larger base on which premiums would be assessed total assets versus insured deposits  was set at a lower percentage than the rate applicable under the old formula 
because our banks  like most community banks  have a much higher ratio of deposits to total assets than the large banks maintain  the new lower rate even applied to a larger base has resulted in a significant decrease in our fdic premiums  while even with the lower rates  the premiums paid by larger banks have generally increased 
visa transactions reversal of the litigation reserve on march   visa inc redeemed  for cash  from its member banks  including glens falls national  of the visa class b shares held by the member banks  using some of the proceeds realized by visa from the initial public offering and sale of its class a shares just then completed 
with another portion of the ipo proceeds  visa established a billion escrow fund to cover certain  but not necessarily all  of its continuing litigation liabilities under various antitrust claims  which its member banks would otherwise be required to bear 
we maintained at year end a thousand accrual for our estimated proportional share of future visa litigation costs  beyond the implicit reserve reflected in visa book valuation of our b shares 
in  we did not recognize on our books any dollar value for our remaining class b visa shares  in accordance with sec guidance  in view of the fact that any future deposits by visa into the escrow fund for covered litigation  while simultaneously reducing our proportionate exposure as a visa member for the litigation  would also directly reduce the dollar value of our class b shares 
since the first quarter of  visa has settled several claims falling within the category of covered litigation  and from time to time has deposited substantial additional amounts into the escrow fund for covered litigation 
such deposits have reduced visa book value of its outstanding class b shares proportionately 
we did not recognize any income or expense after resulting from such additional deposits by visa into the escrow fund as it was not determinable with an appropriate level of certainty what the impact was of such funding on the company contingent obligation beyond its class b visa shares to which the company has not recognized any economic value for these shares 
most recently  in july  visa and mastercard entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with a class of plaintiffs to settle certain additional antitrust claims involving merchant discounts 
visa share of this settlement also will be paid out of its escrow fund 
in light of the current state of covered litigation at visa  which is winding down  as well as the remaining dollar amounts in visa escrow fund  we determined in the second quarter to reverse the entire amount of our remaining visa litigation related accrual  which was thousand pre tax 
this reversal reduced our other operating expenses for the year ending december  we believed then  and continue to believe  that the multi billion dollar balance that visa maintains in its escrow fund is substantially sufficient to satisfy the company contingent liability for the remaining covered litigation 
the company continues not to recognize any economic value for its remaining shares of visa class b common stock 
increase in stockholders equity at december   our tangible book value per share calculated based on stockholders equity reduced by intangible assets including goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to  an increase of  or  from december  our total stockholders equity at december  increased over the year earlier level  and our total book value per share increased by over the year earlier level 
this increase principally reflected the following factors i million net income for the period  offset in part by  ii cash dividends of million  and iii repurchases of our own common stock of million 
as of december   our closing stock price was  resulting in a trading multiple of to our tangible book value 
from a regulatory capital standpoint  the company and each of its subsidiary banks also continued to remain classified as well capitalized at quarter end 
the board of directors declared and the company paid quarterly cash dividends of 
per share for the first three quarters of  as adjusted for a stock dividend distributed september   a cash dividend of 
per share for the fourth quarter of and has declared a 
per share cash dividend for the first quarter of b 
results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  highlights the factors that had the greatest impact on our results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest  dividends and fees earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin 
as described in the section entitled use of non gaap financial measures on page of this report we calculate net interest income on a tax equivalent basis using a marginal tax rate of

following two years of decreases in net interest income in and during a period of rising interest rates  we experienced four successive years of increases in net interest income from through in each of these years  we experienced a benefit from an increase in average earning assets  although the substantial increase in net interest income in was largely attributable to a widened margin during the earlier portion of the year  typical of a period in which interest rates begin to fall  as our paying liabilities reprice downwards more quickly than our earning assets 
from through  however  our net interest margin has been consistently under pressure and has generally declined 
the decrease in net interest income was thousand  or  from to net interest income decreased million  or  from to in  an increase in average earning assets  net of a smaller increase in average interest bearing liabilities ie  changes in volume had a million positive impact on net interest income  while changes in rates provided a million negative impact on our net interest income for the year  as yields on earning assets decreased more rapidly than rates paid on liabilities  the latter being more constrained by the rapid approach of zero as an absolute limit on short term  no or very low risk rates ie  the federal funds rate 
generally  the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  changes in the yield curve  the ratio of our rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes  and changes in the level of nonperforming loans 
impact of interest rate changes changes in interest rates in recent years 
when prevailing rates began to fall at year end  we saw an immediate impact in the reduced cost of our deposits and these costs continued to fall in and and to a lesser extent throughout  and yields on our earning assets have also fallen since  but at a different pace than our cost of funds 
initially  the drop in our asset yields was not as significant as the decline in our deposit rates  but in recent periods since the beginning of the decline in yields on our earning assets has generally exceeded the decline in the cost of our deposits 
as a result of these trends  our net interest margin generally increased in late and early  positively impacting our net interest income  but since mid we  like almost all banks  have experienced a fairly steady contraction in our net interest margin 
changes in the yield curve in recent years 
an additional important aspect in recent years with regard to the effect of prevailing interest rates on our profitability has been the changing shape in the yield curve 
a positive upward sloping yield curve  where long term rates significantly exceed short term rates  is both a more common occurrence and generally a better situation for banks  including ours  than a flat or less upwardly sloping yield curve 
we  like many banks  typically fund longer duration assets with shorter maturity liabilities  and the flattening of the yield curve directly diminishes the benefit of this strategy 
as the financial crisis deepened in the period  long term rates also decreased roughly in parity with the continuing decreases in short term rates  as both short and long term rates approached historically low levels  a goal explicitly sought by the federal reserve 
in recent quarters  as short term rates have neared zero  long term rate decreases generally have exceeded short term rate decreases and the yield curve has flattened somewhat 
in the third quarter of and the second quarter of  the federal reserve undertook new measures specifically designed to reduce longer term rates as compared to short term rates  in an attempt to stimulate the housing market and the economy generally 
thirty year mortgage rates have subsequently fallen to levels not seen in many years  if ever 
continuing pressure on credit quality 
all lending institutions  even those like us who have avoided subprime lending problems and continue to maintain high credit quality  have experienced some continuing pressure on credit quality in recent periods  and this may continue if the national or regional economies continue to be weak or suffer a new downturn 
any credit or asset quality erosion will negatively impact net interest income  and will reduce or possibly outweigh the benefit we may experience from the combination of low prevailing interest rates generally and a modestly upward sloping yield curve 
thus  no assurances can be given on our ability to maintain or increase our net interest margin  net interest income or net income generally  in upcoming periods  particularly as residential mortgage related borrowings have diminished across the economy and the redeployment of funds from maturing loans and assets into similarly high yielding asset categories has become progressively more difficult 
the modest up tick in loan demand and in the us economy generally experienced during may prove transitory  in light of continuing economic and financial woes across the rest of the developed world and stubborn fiscal pressures in the us recent pressure on our net interest margin 
from mid into  our net interest margin held steady at around  but the margin began to narrow in the last three quarters of and throughout and as the downward repricing of paying liabilities slowed while interest earning assets continued to reprice downward at a steady rate 
currently  our net interest margin continues to be under pressure 
during the last five quarters  our margin ranged from to 
even if new assets do not continue to price downward  our average yield on assets may continue to decline in future periods as our older  higher priced assets continue to mature and pay off at a faster rate than newer  lower priced assets 
thus  we may continue to experience additional margin compression in upcoming periods 
that is  our average yield on assets may decline in upcoming periods at a slightly higher rate than our average cost of deposits 
in this light  no assurances can be given that our net interest income will resume the growth it experienced in and prior years  even if asset growth continues or increases  or that net earnings will continue to grow  if net interest income decreases more rapidly than other sources of operating income increase 
potential inflation  effect on interest rates and margins 
currently  there is considerable discussion  and some disagreement  about the possible emergence of meaningful inflation across some or all asset classes in the us or other world economies 
to the extent that such inflation may occur  it is likely to be the result of persistent efforts by the federal reserve and other central banks  including the european central bank  to significantly increase the money supply in the us and western world economies  which in the us started at the onset of the crisis in and continues 
the fed has increased the us money supply by setting and maintaining the fed funds rate at historically low levels with consequent downward pressure on all rates  and by purchasing massive amounts of us treasuries and other debt securities through the federal reserve bank ie  quantitative easing  which is intended in part to have the identical effect of lowering and reinforcing already low interest rates in addition to directly expanding the supply of credit 
when the second round of quantitative easing expired on june   the fed elected not to continue the program  for a variety of reasons including some concern over inflation 
instead  the fed announced it would support economic recovery through a new series of interest rate manipulations  dubbed operation twist  under which it would reinvest the proceeds from maturing short term and long term securities in its substantial us treasury and mortgage backed securities portfolios into longer dated securities  thereby seeking to lower long term rates and mortgage rates  as a priority over further reductions in short term rates 
however  in the ensuing summer months of  the underlying inflation rate in the us  exclusive of the historically volatile categories of fuel and food purchases  remained quite low  and the us economy  though slowly improving  remained sluggish 
as a result  in september  the fed announced that it would resume quantitative easing  by embarking on a program of purchasing billion of mortgage backed securities on a monthly basis in the market until the economy regained suitable momentum so called infinite qe  while at the same time monitoring inflation in the economy  with a view toward taking appropriate corrective measures if inflation increased beyond acceptable levels 
as the us economy continued to demonstrate weakness in the second half of  the fed increased the level of its fixed monthly purchases of debt securities to billion  approximately half treasury bonds and the rest in mortgage backed securities 
however  there has now emerged a certain level of concern not only about the weak us economy  but also that at some point prevailing interest rates may begin to rise  along with inflation  perhaps significant inflation  potentially damaging us financial markets 
for the present  management does not anticipate near term substantial increases in prevailing rates  short or long term 
if modest rate increases should occur  there is some expectation that the impact on our margins  as well as on our net interest income and earnings  may be somewhat negative in the short run but possibly positive in the long run 
given the extraordinary forces currently in play in the financial markets  any speculation on the likelihood of significant inflation in the near future  or the impact of such inflation on prevailing interest rates  short or long term  or on the net interest margins or the net interest income of banks such as ours  must be regarded as highly subjective 
a discussion of the models we use in projecting the impact on net interest income resulting from possible changes in interest rates vis vis the repricing patterns of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report 
a discussion of the models we use in projecting the impact on net interest income resulting from possible changes in interest rates vis vis the repricing patterns of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits total assets earning assets to total assets to in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income 
for  average earning assets increased million or over  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million or 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income  partially offsetting the negative impact of a basis point decrease in our net interest margin from to between the two years which resulted in a million decrease in net interest income 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in the average balance of our securities portfolio and the average balance of total loans from to within the loan portfolio  our three principal segments are residential real estate loans  automobile loans primarily through our indirect lending program and commercial loans 
through all of we sold a significant portion of our residential real estate loan originations into the secondary market  leading to a decrease in the average balance of that portfolio 
the average balance of our automobile loan portfolio increased over the past year reflecting an increase in demand for new vehicles and our pricing on these loans which  although competitive with the rates charged by other commercial banks  still left us at a disadvantage compared to the subsidized  below market loan rates offered by the financing affiliates of the automobile manufacturers 
our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio also experienced growth over the past year 
overall  a significant portion of the growth in our earning assets in was in our lower yielding investment portfolio versus the higher yields in our loan portfolio diminishing to a degree the financial impact of our growth in total earning assets  which was in versus in 
the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities reflected the offsetting impact of an million increase in interest bearing deposits and an million decrease in our other borrowed funds  primarily fhlb term advances 
to for  average earning assets increased million or over  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million or 
this combination had a positive impact of million on our net interest income for the year  diminishing in part the negative effect of the decrease in our  net interest margin  which decreased by basis points from to between the two years 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in the average balance of our securities portfolio  while the average balance of total loans actually decreased from to through all of  we sold a substantial portion of our residential real estate loan originations leading to a decrease in the average balance of that portfolio 
the average balance of our indirect portfolio also decreased between the two years  reflecting both the weak demand for new vehicles and our pricing on these loans like many other banks  we could not compete with the subsidized  below market loan rates offered by the financing affiliates of the automobile manufacturers 
only our commercial loan portfolio experienced growth in as in  most of the growth in our earning assets was in our lower yielding investment portfolio versus the higher yields in our loan portfolio and such growth  in total earning assets was only in versus in 
the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities reflected the offsetting impact of an million increase in interest bearing deposits and a million decrease in our other borrowed funds  primarily fhlb term advances 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments may have on our results of operations

noninterest income the majority of our noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  insurance commissions  and other recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of noninterest income 
analysis of noninterest income dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount income from fiduciary activities fees for other services to customers net gain on securities transactions insurance commissions net gain on sales of loans other operating income total noninterest income compared to total noninterest income in the just completed year was million  an increase of million  or  from total noninterest income of million for the total for both the and periods included net gains on securities transactions  although this item of noninterest income decreased between the two periods  from million to thousand  a net decrease of million 
however  noninterest income from insurance commissions increased by thousand  or  between the two periods  and our net gains on the sale of loans also increased from to  from thousand to million  a net increase of million 
all other categories of noninterest income also increased modestly between the two periods 
assets under trust administration and investment management at december  were billion  up from the prior year end balance of million 
largely as a result of such increase our income from fiduciary services for increased by thousand  or  above the total for a significant portion of our fiduciary fees is indexed to the dollar amount of assets under administration 
any significant downturn in the us stock markets in future periods would likely have a corresponding negative impact on our income from fiduciary activities 
fees for other services to customers primarily service charges on deposit accounts  revenues related to the sale of mutual funds to our customers by third party providers  income from debit card transactions  and servicing income on sold loans were million for  an increase of thousand  or  from the principal cause of the increase between the two periods was an increase in income from debit card transactions  which increased from million for to million for effective october  visa announced reduced debit interchange rates and related modifications to comply with new debit regulatory requirements 
this reduced rate structure has had  and will likely continue to have  a negative impact on our fee income 
however  debit card usage by our customers continues to grow which has had  and if such growth persists  will continue to have  a positive impact on our debit card fee income 
thus  the new law limits on debit transaction interchange fees has not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations since the law enactment 
this increase in income from debit card transactions was offset  in part  by a decrease in fee income from service charges on deposit accounts 
insurance commissions first became a significant source of noninterest income for us following our acquisition of an insurance agency  capital financial group  inc capital financial specializes in selling and servicing group health care policies as well as life insurance 
on april   we acquired a second insurance agency  loomis lapann  inc  which sells property and casualty insurance to retail customers in our service area and sports insurance products to various sports organizations 
in february of  we acquired our third insurance agency  the upstate agency  also a property and casualty insurance agency  and in august we acquired and consolidated two affiliated insurance agencies  the mcphillips agencies  also sellers of property and casualty insurance 
all of these acquired agencies do business within the service areas of our banks 
we expect that noninterest income from insurance commissions will continue to represent a significant portion of our noninterest income in upcoming periods  both absolutely and as a percentage of our total net income  as a result of our recent expansion of this line of business by acquisition  which may continue in the future if favorable opportunities should arise 
starting with the third quarter of  we began to resell most of our newly originated residential real estate loans into the secondary market ie  to freddie mac  which generates additional noninterest income in the form of net gains on sales of loans 
we are unable to predict at what rate we may continue to resell loan originations in future periods  versus holding such loans in our own portfolio 
much depends on the volume of originations  the rates attaching thereto and the ready availability of sale thereof into the secondary market 
we generally retain servicing rights for loans originated and sold by us  which generates additional noninterest income fees for other services to customers 
other operating income includes net gains on the sale of other real estate owned as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
compared to total noninterest income in was million  an increase of million  or  from total noninterest income of million for the total for both the and periods included net gains on securities transactions of million and million  respectively 
however  the expansion of our insurance agency line of business in had the greatest impact on the increase in noninterest income between the two years 
our insurance commissions increased by million or between and  as we acquired three new agencies in see the more detailed discussion of our agency acquisitions above  under compared to assets under trust administration and investment management at december  were million  down somewhat from the prior year end balance of million 
however  income from fiduciary services for increased by thousand  or  above the total for  primarily because  despite the year end totals being lower in than in  the average dollar amount of assets under trust administration during exceeded the average dollar amount during the year end total of assets under administration for was lower than the year end total for because  at the end of the third quarter of  the us stock markets experienced a sharp downturn 
a significant portion of our fiduciary fees is indexed to the dollar amount of assets under administration 
fees for other services to customers were million for  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase between the two periods was attributable to an increase in revenues derived from third party mutual fund sales and to an increase in income from debit card transactions  which increased from million for to million for starting with the third quarter of  we began to resell most of our newly originated residential real estate loans into the secondary market ie  to freddie mac  which generates additional noninterest income in the form of net gains on sales of loans 
we generally retain servicing rights for loans originated and sold by us  which generates additional noninterest income fees for other services to customers 
other operating income includes net gains on the sale of other real estate owned as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
iv 
noninterest expense noninterest expense is a means of measuring the delivery cost of services  products and business activities of a company 
the key components of noninterest expense are presented in the following table 
analysis of noninterest expense dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense of premises  net furniture and equipment expense fdic regular assessment amortization of intangible assets prepayment penalty on fhlb advances other operating expense total noninterest expense compared to noninterest expense for amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from for  our efficiency ratio was 
this ratio  which is a commonly used non gaap financial measure in the banking industry  is a comparative measure of a financial institution operating efficiency 
the efficiency ratio a ratio where lower is better  as we define it  is the ratio of operating noninterest expense excluding intangible asset amortization and the fhlb prepayment penalty to net interest income on a tax equivalent basis plus operating noninterest income excluding net securities gains or losses 
see the discussion of the efficiency ratio on page of this report under the heading use of non gaap financial measures 
the efficiency ratio as defined by the federal reserve board and reported for banks in its peer holding company performance reports excludes net securities gains or losses from the denominator as does our calculation  but unlike our ratio includes intangible asset amortization in the numerator  and thus tends to result in higher ratios than our definition 
our efficiency ratios in recent periods compared favorably to the ratios of our peer group  even as adjusted to add intangible asset amortization back into the numerator of our ratio ie  into our operating noninterest expense 
for  our peer group ratio was  and our ratio not adjusted was 
salaries and employee benefits expense  which typically represents from of total noninterest expense  increased by million  or  from to salary expense increased thousand  or  from primarily due to annual salary increases 
pension costs increased thousand  or from to the principal reason noninterest expense remained virtually unchanged from to  despite the increase between the two years in the largest component of this measure salaries and employee benefits  is because our fdic assessments dropped by  or percent between the two years  and the prepayment penalty recognized by the company in in connection with its prepayment of fhlb advances during that year million  was not replicated in just as our fdic assessment decreased from to  it also decreased from to beginning in the second quarter of  calculation of the fdic premium converted to a new method  based on adjusted assets rather than deposits 
that resulted in continuing and substantial decreases in our fdic insurance expense beginning mid and continuing in we continued to pay the lowest possible rate 
other operating expense increased thousand  or from this was primarily the result of an increase of thousand  or for off premise computer services and thousand  or increase in loan fees 
occupancy and equipment expenses did not significantly change from to compared to noninterest expense for amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from however  the period included a million prepayment penalty from our prepayment of million of fhlb advances 
for  our efficiency ratio was 
this ratio is a commonly used non gaap financial measure 
a more detailed discussion of this measure is set forth above under the heading compared to our efficiency ratio in recent periods has compared favorably to the ratios of our peer group 
the financial results for include i five months of operations for the mcphillips insurance agency  which we acquired on august   ii eleven months of operations for upstate agency  which we acquired on february   and iii a full year of operations for loomis and lapann  which we acquired on april  the results for the prior year do not reflect any expense or income attributable to either upstate or mcphillips  and only nine months of operations for loomis and lapann 
all categories of noninterest expense  including amortization  experienced increases from the acquisition of the agencies in and in mid year except for fdic and fico assessments and the fhlb prepayment penalty 
thus  both the increase in noninterest expense for  as well as in noninterest income for the year  discussed above  reflect expenses and income attributable to the recently acquired agencies 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased by million  or  from to all full time equivalent employees of the agencies acquired in continued employment with us after the acquisitions and the related expense is included in the expense total  but not the expense total 
occupancy expense increased from to the increase was primarily attributable to increases in net rental expense  including offices rented by the recently acquired agencies 
the increase in furniture and equipment expense was primarily attributable to data processing and equipment maintenance expenses 
arrow banks and its subsidiaries sustained little or no physical damage due to tropical storm irene in august allowing us to provide uninterrupted banking and financial services to our customers 
beginning with the second quarter of  the method previously used by the fdic to calculate insurance premiums payment by covered banks was converted to a new method  based on adjusted assets rather than deposits 
the changeover resulted in a significant decrease in our fdic insurance expense from to other operating expense remained essentially unchanged from this was the result of offsetting increases and decreases among a variety of operating categories

income taxes the following table sets forth our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods presented 
income taxes and effective rates dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount provision for income taxes effective tax rate the provisions for federal and state income taxes amounted to million for both and  and million for the effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively  with no significant change in the effective tax rates from year to year

investment portfolio investment securities are classified as held to maturity  trading  or available for sale  depending on the purposes for which such securities are acquired and thereafter held 
securities held to maturity are debt securities that we have both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss

pass through securities provide to the investor monthly portions of principal and interest pursuant to the contractual obligations of the underlying mortgages 
collateralized mortgage obligations cmos separate the repayments on mortgage backed securities into two or more components tranches  where each tranche has a separate estimated life and yield 
our practice has been to purchase only pass through securities and cmos that are issued or guaranteed by us federal agencies  and the tranches of cmos that we purchase generally are those having shorter maturities 
included in our corporate and other debt securities for each of the periods are corporate bonds that were highly rated at the time of purchase  although in some cases the securities had been downgraded before the reporting date

the net unrealized gain or loss on such securities  net of tax  is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the net unrealized gains on securities available for sale was million at december  for both periods  the net unrealized gain was primarily attributable to a decrease in market rates between the date of purchase and the balance sheet date resulting in higher valuations of the portfolio securities

loan portfolio the amounts and respective percentages of loans outstanding represented by each principal category on the dates indicated were as follows a 
types of loans dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial commercial real estate construction commercial real estate other consumer other consumer automobile residential real estate total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net maintenance of high quality in the loan portfolio in late and through  residential property values continued to weaken in most markets  and this trend continued for most of  although at year end the decline appeared to be slowing or even reversing itself  at least in some markets 
some analysts currently are speculating that a bottom may have been established in the real estate markets  both in terms of price and quantity of transactions  but the evidence is still inconclusive 
as was true during the initial stages of the real estate collapse  indications of stability or revival in the residential and commercial real estate markets vary significantly from market to market 
the weakness in the asset portfolios of many financial institutions remains a serious concern  offset somewhat by recent firming up in some real estate markets and by the general stabilization in the equity markets in recent years  including a modest rebound in the equities in first three quarters of reaching a high in the fourth quarter not seen since in sum  many lending institutions large and small continue to suffer from a lingering weakness in large portions of their existing loan portfolios as well as by limited opportunities for secure and profitable expansion of their portfolios 
for many reasons  including our conservative credit underwriting standards  we have largely avoided the negative impact on asset quality that other banks have suffered 
through the date of this report  we have not experienced a significant deterioration in our loan portfolios 
in general  we underwrite our residential real estate loans to secondary market standards for prime loans 
we have never engaged in subprime mortgage lending as a business line and we never extended or purchased any so called alt a  negative amortization  option arm  or negative equity mortgage loans 
on occasion we have made loans to borrowers having a fico score of or below or have had extensions of credit outstanding to borrowers who have developed credit problems after origination resulting in deterioration of their fico scores 
we also on occasion have extended community development loans to borrowers whose creditworthiness is below our normal standards as part of the community support program we have developed in fulfillment of our statutorily mandated duty to support low and moderate income borrowers within our service area 
however  we are a prime lender and apply prime lending standards and this  together with the fact that the service area in which we make most of our loans has not experienced as severe a decline in property values or economic conditions generally as other parts of the us  are the principal reasons that we have not to date experienced significant deterioration in our loan portfolio  including the real estate categories of our loan portfolio 
however  like all other banks we operate in an environment where identifying opportunities for secure and profitable expansion of our loan portfolio is challenging  where competition is intense  and where margins are very tight 
if the us economy continues to be weak  our region also will continue to experience stress from an economic and financial standpoint  and individual borrowers will also continue to experience stress  as many small businesses are operating on very narrow margins and many families are living on very tight budgets 
given our conservative underwriting standards  we may continue to experience only modest loan portfolio growth or even no growth 
moreover  if the us or our regional economy worsens  which we think unlikely but possible  we may experience elevated charge offs  higher provisions to our loan loss reserve  and increasing expense related to asset maintenance and supervision 
residential real estate loans in recent years  residential real estate and home equity loans have represented the largest single segment of our loan portfolio comprising approximately of the entire portfolio at year end  eclipsing both indirect loans of the portfolio and our commercial and commercial real estate loans 
our gross originations for residential real estate loans were million  million and million for the years   and  respectively 
these origination totals have significantly exceeded the sum of repayments and prepayments in the portfolio  but we have also sold significant quantities of originations 
during the last quarter of and the first two quarters of  as prevailing mortgage rates began to decline  we sold most of our mortgage originations in the secondary market 
during the second half of and the first two quarters of  for a variety of reasons  we began to retain a larger percentage of the newly originated loans in our portfolio  selling only a relatively small portion of the originations to freddie mac with further reductions in the portfolio as a result of normal principal amortization and prepayments on pre existing loans 
after april  rates on conventional real estate mortgages continued to fall  even as demand for such mortgages other than refinancings remained relatively weak 
in april  the national average for year conventional fixed rate mortgage loans was  but by the last quarter of the national average had dropped below  a relative decline of more than percent 
in response  we determined to resume selling most of our originations to freddie mac  amounting to million for and million for all of if the current low rate environment for newly originated residential real estate loans persists  we may continue to sell a significant portion of our loan originations and  as a result  may even experience a decrease in our outstanding balances in this segment of our portfolio 
moreover  if our local economy or real estate market suffers further major downturns  the demand for residential real estate loans in our service area may decrease  which also may negatively impact our real estate portfolio and our financial performance 
automobile loans primarily through indirect lending at december   our automobile loans primarily loans originated through dealerships located primarily in the eastern region of upstate new york represented the third largest category of loans in our portfolio  but still a significant component of our business 
during  there was a modest nation wide resurgence in automobile sales especially in the first quarter  due in the view of many to an aging fleet and a modest resurgence in consumer optimism 
we too saw an increase in our originations  from million for to million for  and our outstanding balances increased 
for  our originations of indirect loans were million  a decrease of million  or  from the total for prepayments and normal amortization during the year exceeded our originations  and as a consequence the outstanding balance of our automobile loan portfolio decreased by million  or  during in  net charge offs for our automobile loans were less than our net charge offs for the period  and net charge offs for were below the net charge offs for our experienced lending staff not only utilizes credit evaluation software tools but also reviews and evaluates each loan individually 
we believe our disciplined approach to evaluating risk has contributed to maintaining our strong loan quality in this portfolio 
however  if weakness in auto demand returns  our portfolio is likely to experience limited  if any  overall growth  either in real terms or as a percentage of the total portfolio  regardless of whether the auto company affiliates are offering highly subsidized loans 
although recently somewhat improved  customer demand for vehicle loans is still well below pre crisis levels and if demand does not continue to improve  neither will our financial performance in this important loan category 
commercial  commercial real estate and construction and land development loans over the last decade  we have experienced moderate and occasionally strong demand for commercial and commercial real estate loans 
these loan balances have generally increased  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio  and this segment of our portfolio was the segment least affected by the crisis 
for  commercial loan growth was steady as outstanding balances increased by million  or  over the december  level 
in our balances also grew over the levels  increasing at year end by million  or over the year end amount 
substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans in our portfolio are extended to businesses or borrowers located in our regional market 
many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime  fhlbny rates or us treasury indices 
although on a national scale the commercial real estate market suffered a major downturn in the period from which it has not yet fully recovered  we have not experienced any significant weakening in the quality of our commercial loan portfolio in recent years 
it is entirely possible  however  that we may experience a reduction in the demand for such loans and or a weakening in the quality of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio in upcoming periods 
generally  however  the corporate sector  at least in our service area  appears to be in reasonably good financial condition at present 
the following table indicates the changing mix in our loan portfolio by including the quarterly average balances for our significant loan products for the past five quarters 
the remaining quarter by quarter tables present the percentage of total loans represented by each category and the annualized tax equivalent yield of each category 
loan portfolio quarterly average loan balances dollars in thousands quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer loans automobile other consumer loans total loans percentage of total quarterly average loans quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer loans automobile other consumer loans total loans quarterly tax equivalent yield on loans quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer loans automobile other consumer loans total loans other consumer loans includes certain home improvement loans secured by mortgages 
however  these same loan balances are reported as residential real estate in the table of period end balances on page  captioned types of loans 
as the yield table above indicates  average rates across our portfolio have steadily declined over the last quarters  in direct response to the fed maintaining historically low interest rates in its attempt to revive the economy  coupled with a general moderation of loan demand on the part of corporate and individual customers 
for the fourth quarter of the average yield on our loan portfolio declined by basis points from the fourth quarter of  from to 
the decrease was exacerbated by extremely competitive pressures on rates for new commercial and commercial real estate loans as well as automobile loans and the decreasing rate environment generally 
the yields on new year fixed rate residential real estate loans the choice of most of our mortgage customers remained very low during the quarter  so we continued to sell most of those originations to the secondary market  specifically  to freddie mac 
as average yields on the portfolio were dropping in  our margins were also compressing 
the decrease in average yield on our loan portfolio of basis points was basis points greater than the basis point decline in our average cost of deposits from the last quarter of to the last quarter of we expect that average loan yields will continue to decline in  at a faster rate than our average cost of deposits  and that margins too may continue to diminish 
in general  the yield tax equivalent interest income divided by average loans on our loan portfolio and other earning assets has historically been impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates  as previously discussed in this report beginning on page under the heading impact of interest rate changes 
we expect that such will continue to be the case  that is  that loan yields will continue to rise and fall with changes in prevailing market rates  although the timing and degree of responsiveness will be influenced by a variety of other factors  including the extent of federal government and federal reserve participation in the home mortgage market  the makeup of our loan portfolio  the shape of the yield curve  consumer expectations and preferences  and the rate at which the portfolio expands 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash flow reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the current yields 
thus  even if prevailing rates do not fall significantly or at all in upcoming periods  our average rate on our portfolio may continue to decline as older credits in our portfolio bearing generally higher rates continue to mature and roll over or are redeployed into lower priced loans 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and interest rate structure of our commercial and commercial real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category 
most of the commercial construction loans are made with a commitment for permanent financing  whether extended by us or unrelated third parties 
the maturity distribution below reflects the final maturity of the permanent financing 
b 
maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates in thousands within year after but within years after years total commercial commercial real estate construction total fixed interest rates variable interest rates total commitments and lines of credit stand by letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business  which are not reflected in the financial statements at a given date because the commitments are not funded at that time 
as of december   our total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  we also have issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
c 
risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the amounts of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans for the past five years are presented in the table on page under the heading summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status either due to the delinquency status of principal and or interest or a judgment by management that the full repayment of principal and interest is unlikely 
loans secured by home equity lines of credit are put on nonaccrual status when days past due  residential real estate loans when days past due  commercial and commercial real estate loans are evaluated on a loan by loan basis and are placed on nonaccrual status when days past due if the full collection of principal and interest is uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans not secured by real estate must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
loans secured with non real estate collateral in the process of collection are charged down to the value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
open end credits  residential real estate loans and commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis when placed on nonaccrual status 
we had no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
the balance of loans days past due totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans at december  were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect automobile loans  million of residential real estate loans and million of commercial and commercial real estate loans 
prior to june  banking regulators excluded modified consumer loans from the amount financial institutions were required to report as restructured loans 
beginning with the second quarter of  all modified loans  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  are reported as restructured loans in compliance with modified terms  unless the restructured loan is on nonaccrual status and is included with the reported amount of nonaccrual loans 
we evaluate nonaccrual loans over thousand and all troubled debt restructured loans individually for impairment 
all our impaired loans are measured based on either i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate  ii the loan observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 
we determine impairment for collateralized loans based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan effective interest rate 
we determine the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis 
our method for measuring all other loans is described in detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
beginning in  the loan note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page now contains the detailed information on modified loans and impaired loans  that was formerly described in this section 
potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  we apply an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing but exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
periodically we review the loan portfolio for evidence of potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower causes doubt about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
through our on going credit monitoring  we consider loans which  in our internal classification system  are classified as substandard but continue to accrue interest to be potential problem loans 
at december   we identified commercial loans totaling million as potential problem loans 
at december   we identified commercial loans totaling million as potential problem loans 
factors such as payment history  value of supporting collateral  and personal or government guarantees led us to conclude that the current risk exposure on these loans did not warrant accounting for the loans as nonperforming 
although in a performing status as of year end  these loans exhibited certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming at some point in the future 
the overall level of our performing loans that demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state  which in turn are generally impacted at least in part by economic conditions in the us on both the regional and national level  economic conditions are generally improved over the period  but are much weaker than was the case in and earlier periods 
if weak or stagnant economic conditions persist  potential problems loans likely will increase 
foreign outstandings none loan concentrations the loan portfolio is well diversified 
there are no concentrations of credit that exceed of the portfolio  other than the general categories reported in the preceding section ciia of this item for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

during average deposit balances increased by million  or  over the average for the increase was generated from our pre existing branch network  although we did open a new branch in queensbury  new york during the year 
we did not sell or close any branches during the covered period   although we did move our salem branch to a larger and more accessible location 
we did not hold any brokered deposits during  and the following table presents the quarterly average balance by deposit type for each of the most recent five quarters 
deposit portfolio quarterly average deposit balances dollars in thousands quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits now accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits fluctuations in balances of our now accounts and time deposits of  or more are largely the result of municipal deposit fluctuations 
municipal deposits on average represent to of our total deposits 
municipal deposits are typically placed in now accounts and time deposits of short duration 
many of our municipal deposit relationships are subject to annual renewal  by formal or informal agreements 
in general  there is a seasonal pattern to municipal deposits starting with a low point during july and august 
account balances tend to increase throughout the fall and into the winter months from tax deposits and receive an additional boost at the end of march from the electronic deposit of state funds 
in addition to these seasonal fluctuations within types of accounts  the overall level of municipal deposit balances fluctuates from year to year as some municipalities move their accounts in and out of our banks due to competitive factors 
often  the balances of municipal deposits at the end of a quarter are not representative of the average balances for that quarter 
for a variety of reasons  including the seasonality of municipal deposits  we typically experience little net growth or a small contraction in average deposit balances in the first quarter of each calendar year  significant growth in the second quarter  contraction in the third quarter and substantial growth in the fourth quarter 
deposit balances followed this general pattern for  enhanced by the addition of new municipal account relationships throughout the year 
we also experienced growth in our non municipal account balances  primarily in now accounts and money market savings accounts 
we typically experience a shift within the mix of deposit categories during periods of significant interest rate increases or decreases 
during periods of falling rates and very low rates  such as the period from mid through the end of  depositors tend to transfer maturing time deposits to nonmaturity interest bearing deposit products 
this was our experience during at december  time deposits represented of total deposits  down from at december  this year end level for time deposits was the lowest level since june   when the ratio was  and compares to a high ratio of at june  we expect this shift from time deposits to nonmaturity deposit products to continue  although perhaps at a slower pace  if deposit rates remain at their current extraordinarily low levels 
the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below 
percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits now accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are typically obtained on a competitive bid basis 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits now accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits in general  rates paid by us on various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by our competitors  which in turn are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve bank 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of our deposit liabilities  although this lag is normally shorter than the lag between federal reserve rate actions and the repricing of our loans and other earning assets 
as demonstrated in the table above  we like all insured depository institutions experienced a steady decrease in the cost of our deposits in each of the past quarters mirroring and continuing the protracted period of falling interest rates extending from mid through the end of although some maturing time deposits will continue to reprice at lower rates in forthcoming periods  the favorable reduction in the cost of deposits may not continue since most of our time deposits have already repriced to current rates and the rates on our nonmaturity deposit balances have already been reduced to or nearly to the lowest sustainable levels 
we do not use brokered deposits as a regular funding source and there were not any such balances carried during  or the maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  are presented below

liquidity our liquidity is measured by our ability to access cash when we need it at a reasonable cost 
we must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to our customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  we must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
overnight investments in federal funds sold  interest bearing bank balances at the federal reserve bank  and cash flow from investment securities and loans  both from normal repayment cash flows and prepayments  and the ability to quickly pledge a substantial portion of our available marketable investment securities and loans to obtain funds  represent our primary sources of available operating liquidity 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
our securities available for sale portfolio was million at year end due to the potential for volatility in market values  we are not able to assume that large quantities of such securities could be sold at short notice at their carrying value  if needed immediately for liquidity purposes 
but  if market conditions are favorable resulting in unrealized gains in the available for sale portfolio  we may pursue modest sales of such securities conducted in an orderly fashion to provide for anticipated future liquidity needs 
in addition to liquidity from short term investments  investment securities and loans  we have supplemented available operating liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as federal funds lines of credit and credit lines with the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny 
we have established federal funds lines of credit with three correspondent banks totaling million  but did not draw on those lines during through our borrowing relationship with the fhlbny  we have pledged collateral  including mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loans 
our unused borrowing capacity at the fhlbny for both overnight and term advances was at december  during  we used the overnight facility for a short period 
the average balance of these overnight advances was million for the average balance in other short term borrowings for consisted entirely of treasury  tax and loan balances at the federal reserve bank of new york against which we could borrow on a short term basis  but by year end the federal reserve had canceled this program 
we measure and monitor our liability needs as a ratio of liquid assets to total short term and potentially volatile liabilities  including the availability of dependable borrowing sources 
at december   our basic liquidity ratio was of total assets  or million  well above our minimum ratio as defined in policy of  or million of total assets at december  in addition  we have identified brokered certificates of deposit as an appropriate off balance sheet source of funding accessible in a relatively short time period 
we have not utilized brokered cds to raise funds in recent years 
also  our two bank subsidiaries have each established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window borrowings which we maintain for contingency liquidity purposes 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million  but there were no advances then outstanding 
based on the level of overnight funds investments  available liquidity from our investment securities portfolio  cash flow from our loan portfolio  our stable core deposit base and our significant borrowing capacity  we believe that our available operating and contingency liquidity is sufficient to meet funding needs that may arise in upcoming periods in connection with any reasonably likely events or occurrences 
during the past several quarters  our liquidity position has been strong  as depositors and investors in the wholesale funding markets have shown no hesitations on placing or maintaining their funds with our banks 
in addition  management has consciously maintained a strong liquidity position by emphasizing its short maturity asset portfolios  including cash and due from banks  as opposed to investments in longer term assets which might generate slightly higher returns 
the financial markets have been challenging for many financial institutions  and in the view of many  lack of liquidity has been as great a problem as capital shortage 
as a result  liquidity premiums have widened and many banks have experienced certain liquidity constraints  including substantially increased pricing to retain deposit balances 
because of arrow favorable credit quality and strong balance sheet  arrow has not experienced any significant liquidity constraints through the date of this report and has not been forced to pay premium rates to obtain retail deposits or other funds from any source 
e 
capital resources and dividends important proposed changes to regulatory capital standards the dodd frank act directed us bank regulators to promulgate new capital standards  which when adopted by regulators  must be at least as strict ie  must establish minimum capital levels that are at least as high for banking organizations on a consolidated basis as the regulatory capital standards for us insured depository financial institutions at the time dodd frank was enacted in the regulators  acting jointly  in june  issued proposed new capital rules for us banking organizations that aimed at implementing these dodd frank capital requirements 
these proposed rules were also intended to coordinate us bank capital standards with the current drafts of the basel iii proposed international capital standards and would result in significantly more stringent standards upon full implementation than are now in place for us financial institutions 
on november   the us federal bank regulators announced that they would not implement their proposed new capital rules on the previously suggested effective date of january  since this announcement  the regulatory authorities have been in the process of reviewing comments and concerns about the proposed new rules  which may be revised and re issued by the regulators  perhaps in proposed form 
however  no specific guidance was provided as of the end of regarding any planned revisions 
the following is a summary of the proposed new capital rules  as issued in june of in general  the proposed new rules expand the risk weighting categories of assets from to although there are several other super weighted categories for high risk assets that are generally not held by community banks like us 
the proposed rules also are more restrictive in their definitions of what qualify as capital components and set new  higher minimum capital ratios 
importantly  the june proposed rules require community banks like us to begin amortizing the trust preferred securities trups held on our books as of may   over a year period commencing in  even though such trups generally were accorded grandfathered status under dodd frank itself ie  would be eligible in their entirety for tier capital treatment until maturity or redemption 
any such early amortization of trups may present substantial additional difficulties for community banks  like us  that are and will remain well capitalized but would prefer not have to seek additional capital in what are currently very tight capital markets  to replace their amortized trups  as the price of continuing to grow their asset portfolios 
for community banks  such as ours  the proposed new rules would add a new capital ratio  a common equity tier capital ratio 
the primary difference between this ratio and the current tier leverage ratio is that only common equity will qualify as tier capital under the new ratio 
the new common equity tier capital ratio also will include unrealized securities gains and losses as part of both capital and assets 
in addition to setting higher minimum capital ratios  the june proposed new rules  as part of their general thrust in requiring enhanced capital for all banks  would introduce a new concept  a so called capital conservation buffer set at under the proposed rules  which must be added to each of the proposed new minimum capital ratios which by themselves are somewhat higher than the current minimum ratios 
when  during economic downturns  an institution capital begins to erode  the first deductions from a regulatory perspective would be taken against the conservation buffer  to the extent that buffer should erode below the required level  the bank would not necessarily be required to replace the capital deficit immediately but would face restrictions on paying dividends and other negative consequences until it did so 
the following table compares the minimum capital ratios under the june proposed rules  including the capital conservation buffer  with the current well capitalized ratios capital ratios comparison of proposed minimum ratios including the buffer to current well capitalized ratios capital ratio proposed minimum with buffer current well capitalized common equity tier capital ratio n a tier leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio the changes in the proposed new rules that would have the largest impact on our regulatory capital position  at the holding company and the bank level  include the possible phase out over years of trups as tier capital for mid sized banks such as arrow see the discussion in the section recent legislative developments the dodd frank act on page  above  and the discussion below under current regulatory capital standards  a risk weighting scheme for residential real estate loans based on loan to value ratios  weighting nonperforming loans at versus at present  and a requirement to include unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  net of tax  as a component of capital 
we note that if the proposed new capital rules issued in june had been effective on december   as initially planned  our capital ratios would have exceeded each of the proposed minimums  including the capital conservation buffer 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the proposed new capital and liquidity requirements  we are not able to predict at this time the standards that may become applicable to arrow under those rules  as they may be revised and implemented in the future  or the impact that these new rules may have on arrow 
the new standards are likely to require significantly higher minimum levels of capital for us financial institutions than the current standards require 
current regulatory capital standards the discussion and disclosure below on regulatory capital is qualified in its entirety by reference to the fact that  as discussed above  the content and impact of the capital standards to be implemented under the dodd frank act are currently not known 
regulatory capital the following discussion of capital focuses on regulatory capital ratios  as defined and mandated for financial institutions by federal bank regulatory authorities 
regulatory capital  although a financial measure that is not provided for or governed by gaap  nevertheless has been exempted by the sec from the definition of non gaap financial measures in the sec regulation g governing disclosure by registered companies of non gaap financial measures 
thus  certain information which is generally required to be presented in connection with our disclosure of non gaap financial measures need not be provided  and has not been provided  for the regulatory capital measures discussed below 
current capital standards our holding company and our subsidiary banks are currently subject to two sets of regulatory capital measures  risk based capital guidelines and a leverage ratio test 
the risk based guidelines assign risk weightings to all assets and certain off balance sheet items of financial institutions  which generally results in a substantial discounting of low risk or risk free assets  that is  a significant dollar amount of such assets disappears from the balance sheet 
the guidelines then establish an minimum ratio of qualified total capital to risk weighted assets 
at least half of total capital must consist of tier capital  which comprises common equity and common equity equivalents  retained earnings  a limited amount of permanent preferred stock and for holding companies a limited amount of trust preferred securities see the discussion below on these securities  less intangible assets  net of associated deferred tax liabilities 
up to half of total capital may consist of so called tier capital  comprising a limited amount of subordinated debt  other preferred stock  certain other instruments and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the second regulatory capital measure  the leverage ratio test  establishes minimum limits on the ratio of tier capital to total tangible assets  without risk weighting i 
e  discounting 
for top rated companies  the minimum leverage ratio currently is  but lower rated or rapidly expanding companies may be required by bank regulators to meet substantially higher minimum leverage ratios 
federal banking law mandates certain actions to be taken by banking regulators for financial institutions that are deemed undercapitalized as measured under regulatory capital guidelines 
the law establishes five levels of capitalization for financial institutions ranging from well capitalized the highest ranking to critically undercapitalized the lowest ranking 
federal banking law also ties the ability of banking organizations to engage in certain types of non banking financial activities to such organizations continuing to qualify as well capitalized under these standards 
capital ratios the table below sets forth the capital ratios of our holding company and subsidiary banks  glens falls national and saratoga national  as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb tier leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio at december  our holding company and both banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by the currently applicable regulatory guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the further discussion under supervision and regulation in part i item c of this report 
as referenced above  based on the dodd frank act capital standard statutory directives and the pending dodd frank capital standard regulations  there is considerable current speculation in banking and financial circles that bank regulatory capital guidelines will likely be adjusted in forthcoming periods so as to require a greater degree of capital protection against sudden financial stress within banks 
however  there is no consensus on what these enhanced capital standards will look like or over what period they will be imposed on the banking sectors 
capital components  dividends  stock repurchases stockholders equity stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the most significant positive changes to stockholders equity included a net income of million  b equity received from our various stock based compensation plans of million  offset  in part by d a net retirement plan losses reflected as a component of other comprehensive income of thousand  e cash dividends of million  and f purchases of our own common stock of million 
trust preferred securities under dodd frank in each of and  we issued million of trust preferred securities trups in a private placement 
under the federal reserve board pre existing rules on regulatory capital  trups typically would qualify as tier capital for bank holding companies such as ours but only in amounts up to of tier capital  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
under the dodd frank act  trust preferred securities issued by arrow on or after the grandfathering date set forth in dodd frank may  will no longer qualify as tier capital under bank regulatory capital guidelines  however  our trups outstanding prior to the grandfathering cutoff date set forth in dodd frank may  may continue to qualify as tier capital until maturity or redemption 
however  as stated above  the proposed new capital rules  if adopted in the form proposed in june of  would impose a phase out of such qualification for our previously issued trust preferred securities 
dividends the source of funds for the payment of stockholder dividends by our holding company consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to the holding company by our bank subsidiaries 
in addition to indirect regulatory limitations on payments of dividends by our holding company ie  the need to maintain adequate regulatory capital  there are statutory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiaries to our holding company 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the holding company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of our holding company and our banks to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines and applicable laws 
see part ii  item  market for the registrant common equity and related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for a recent history of our cash dividend payments 
stock repurchase program in november  the board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program  effective january  the program  under which management was authorized  in its discretion  to repurchase from time to time during  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  up to million of arrow common stock  to the extent management believed the company stock was reasonably priced and such repurchases appeared to be an attractive use of available capital and in the best interests of stockholders 
as of december   approximately million had been used under the program to repurchase shares 
in december  the board of directors authorized a similar million stock repurchase program  effective for calendar year f 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we may engage in a variety of financial transactions or arrangements  including derivative transactions or arrangements  that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions or arrangements involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions or arrangements may be used by us or our customers for general corporate purposes  such as managing credit  interest rate  or liquidity risk or to optimize capital  or may be used by us or our customers to manage funding needs 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in our loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  our business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates interest rates or prices fees for products and services will make our position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of interest rate and market risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting our asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
we have not made use of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  in our risk management process 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to the risk of prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk  including periodic stress testing involving hypothetical sudden and significant interest rate spikes 
our standard simulation model attempts to capture the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and a basis point downward shift in interest rates  and a repricing of interest bearing assets and liabilities at their earliest reasonably predictable repricing date 
we normally apply a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period 
however  at year end the targeted federal funds rate remained where it had been since late  a range of to  with assurances from the fed that prevailing rates would remain at or near their current historically low rates at least through year end moreover  our average cost of deposits for had decreased to 
thus  for purposes of our decreasing rate simulation  we applied a hypothetical basis point downward shift in interest rates for the long end of the yield curve with hypothetical short term rate decreases equal to the lesser of basis points or such lower rate decrease required to reach zero percent 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income  and a basis point zero limit decrease in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income 
these amounts were well within our alco policy limits 
historically there has existed an inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and our net interest income  reflecting the fact that our liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than our earning assets 
however  when prevailing interest rates are already extremely low  as is the case at present  a further decline in prevailing rates may not produce the otherwise expected increase in net interest income  even over a relatively short time horizon  because as noted above  further decreases in rates with respect to liabilities deposits may be significantly impeded by the absolute lower boundary of the zero rate  whereas further decreases in asset rates are not  as a technical matter at least  subject to the same absolute lower boundary and thus assets may more fully  if more slowly  reprice downward in response to general rate declines than liabilities 
even in the short run  rate decreases may not be beneficial to income 
this explains the anomalous result of our simulation model  above  ie  that over the indicated time horizon of months  an assumed increase in prevailing rates projects a decrease in our net interest income  as might normally be expected due to assets repricing more slowly than liabilities  while at the same time  an assumed decrease in prevailing rates also projects a decrease  if a smaller decrease  in our net interest income  presumably due to the zero rate boundary factor 
moreover  if the impact of rate change on our income is projected over a longer time horizon  eg  two years or longer  it might be expected that a decrease in prevailing rates would have a greater negative impact on our income  as compared to the short term result  as assets reprice downward in full response  while liabilities do not further reprice but remain trapped by the absolute zero rate boundary 
on the other hand  an increase in prevailing rates would have a much less negative impact over the longer term  and perhaps even a neutral or positive impact  on our net interest income  as our asset portfolios eventually reprice upward fully to match the repricing of our liabilities 
however  other factors may play a significant role in any analysis of the impact of rising rates on our income  including a possible softening of loan demand and or slowing of the economy that might be expected to accompany any general rate rise 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast on our part and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
we continue to believe that  in a normalized rate environment  any downturn in prevailing interest rates will generally have a short term positive impact on our net interest margin and net interest income  which would be mitigated or perhaps reversed over the mid to longer term of ensuing rate decreases 
we also believe an upturn in prevailing rates will generally have a short term negative impact on our margin and net interest income  which again would likely be mitigated or perhaps reversed as rates continue to rise over the medium or long term 
we believe that  whether rates are generally increasing  decreasing or stable  changes in the slope of the yield curve will also affect net interest income and the net interest margin 
other things being equal  a more sharply sloping upward yield curve will generally have a positive impact on our net interest income and interest margin  whereas a flattening yield curve will generally have a negative impact 
we are not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects taken together that is  changes in rates  plus changes in the yield curve would be in any particular case  especially if changes in rate and curve  taken independently  would normally work against each other eg  lower rates  combined with a flattening yield curve 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of changes in interest rates including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
