overview we are a leading provider of data driven and transaction based marketing and customer loyalty solutions 
we offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated outsourced marketing solutions  including customer loyalty programs  database marketing services  marketing strategy consulting  analytics and creative services  direct marketing services and private label and co brand retail credit card programs 
we focus on facilitating and managing interactions between our clients and their customers through all consumer marketing channels  including in store  on line  catalog  mail  telephone and email  and emerging channels such as mobile and social media 
we capture and analyze data created during each customer interaction  leveraging the insight derived from that data to enable clients to identify and acquire new customers and to enhance customer loyalty 
we believe that our services are becoming increasingly valuable as businesses shift marketing resources away from traditional mass marketing toward highly targeted marketing programs that provide measurable returns on marketing investments 
we operate in the following reportable segments loyaltyone  epsilon  and private label services and credit 
loyaltyone 
the loyaltyone segment generates revenue primarily from our coalition loyalty program  the air miles reward program in canada and  as such  the segment can be impacted by changes in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
in our air miles reward program  we primarily collect fees from our sponsors based on the number of air miles reward miles issued and  in limited circumstances  the number of air miles reward miles redeemed 
all of the fees collected for air miles reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time 
air miles reward miles issued and air miles reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of loyaltyone s revenue and indicators of the success of the program 
these two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process 
air miles reward miles issued the number of air miles reward miles issued reflects the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors  who pay us a fee per air miles reward mile issued 
the fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of air miles reward miles represent future revenue and earnings for us 
the service element consists of marketing and administrative services 
revenue related to the service element is determined in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards update  or asu   multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
it is initially deferred and then amortized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile  or a period of months  beginning with the issuance of the air miles reward mile and ending upon its expected redemption 
there have been no changes to management s estimate of the life of an air miles reward mile in the period presented 
with the adoption of asu  the residual method is no longer utilized for new sponsor agreements entered into or existing sponsor agreements that are materially modified  for these agreements  we measure the service element at its estimated selling price 
air miles reward miles redeemed redemptions show that collectors are redeeming air miles reward miles to collect the rewards that are offered through our programs  which is an indicator of the success of the program 
we recognize revenue from the redemptions of air miles reward miles by collectors 
the revenue related to the redemption element is based on the estimated fair value and is deferred until the collector redeems the air miles reward miles or over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile in the case of air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unused by the collector base or breakage 
the estimate of breakage changed from to as of december  see discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates and note  deferred revenue  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the number of air miles reward miles issued impacts the number of future air miles reward miles available to be redeemed 
this can also impact our future revenue recognized with respect to the number of air miles reward miles redeemed and the amount of breakage for those air miles reward miles expected to go unredeemed 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile and breakage are actively monitored and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates 
in the fourth quarter of  the air miles reward program implemented a policy for the expiration of inactive accounts  cancelling the air miles reward miles in the collector s account or closing such accounts when no air miles reward miles are collected  redeemed or transferred for consecutive months 
in december  we introduced a new program option called air miles cash to which collectors can allocate some or all of their future air miles reward miles collected 
effective march  collectors were able to instantly redeem their air miles reward miles collected in air miles cash towards in store purchases at participating sponsors 

index as of december   approximately one million collectors have enrolled in the program  which permits instant redemptions at seven sponsors 
we expect to expand the number of sponsors with instant redemption capability in  with a focus on high frequency retail sponsors  however  the timing is dependent by required point of sale programming changes on the part of the sponsors 
as the air miles reward miles are issued and redeemed in a separate pool  the estimated life of an air miles reward mile in air miles cash and related breakage are determined separately from our historical pool of air miles reward miles 
our current expectation is that the estimated life of an air miles cash reward mile is relatively short 
we did not recognize any breakage associated with air miles cash in  and do not expect to recognize any breakage associated with air miles cash until we have sufficient evidence to make the assessment 
air miles cash did not have a material impact to air miles reward miles redeemed or issued in or to our results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  the air miles reward program also implemented an expiry policy  such that all existing and future air miles reward miles will have an expiry of five years  effective from december  epsilon 
the epsilon segment is a leading marketing services firm providing end to end  integrated marketing solutions that leverage transactional data to help clients more effectively acquire and build stronger relationships with their customers 
services include strategic consulting  customer database technologies  loyalty management  proprietary data  predictive modeling and a full range of direct and digital agency services 
private label services and credit 
the private label services and credit segment provides risk management solutions  account origination  funding services  transaction processing  customer care and collection services for our more than private label retail and co branded credit card programs 
private label services and credit primarily generates revenue from finance charges and late fees as well as other servicing fees 
we focus our sales efforts on prime borrowers and do not target sub prime borrowers 
additionally  economic trends can impact this segment 
private label credit sales and average credit card receivables are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment 
private label credit sales this represents the dollar value of private label credit card sales that occur at our clients point of sale terminals or through catalogs or web sites 
generally  we are paid a percentage of these sales  referred to as merchant discount  from the retailers that utilize our program 
increases in private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our bank subsidiaries 
average credit card receivables this represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders at the beginning of each month during the period in question 
customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle 
there are many factors that impact the outstanding balances  such as payment rates  charge offs  recoveries and delinquencies 
management actively monitors all of these factors 
corporate other 
this includes corporate overhead  which is not allocated to our segments  as well as all other immaterial businesses 
year in review highlights loyaltyone revenue increased to million and adjusted ebitda increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the loyaltyone segment generates revenue primarily from our coalition loyalty program in canada and  as such  the segment can be impacted by changes in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
a weaker canadian dollar negatively impacted the year ended december  as the average foreign currency exchange rate for the year ended december  was as compared to in the same prior year period  which lowered revenue and adjusted ebitda by million and million  respectively 

index air miles reward miles redeemed during the year ended december  increased as compared to the prior year due to higher collector redemptions 
the introduction of a five year expiry policy for the air miles reward program in december stimulated redemption activity during the first half of  which moderated throughout the latter half of air miles reward miles issued during the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year due to positive growth in consumer credit card spending and increased promotional activity in the gas and grocer sectors 
during the year ended december   we signed new agreements with general motors of canada limited  michaels of canada and toys r us  canada to participate as sponsors in the air miles reward program 
as of december   we changed our estimate of breakage from to 
the change in estimate will have no impact on the total redemption liability  but it will reduce the amount of deferred breakage by approximately million that is expected to be recognized over the remaining life of the air miles reward mile 
this change in estimate is expected to reduce earnings before taxes by approximately million in  million in  million in and million in we expect to offset this loss with expense reductions and higher product margins 
with respect to other international initiatives  in  dotz  in which we have a ownership  continued to roll out its coalition loyalty program into additional regions 
we announced the rollout of dotz into the sao paulo state interior in april  into fortaleza in july and into recife in november with these expansions  the dotz program now operates in five markets in brazil with more than million consumers enrolled in the program 
we expect to enter into five additional markets in brazil during in june  we acquired an additional ownership interest in direxions global solutions private ltd  a loyalty  crm solutions and data analytics provider in india  bringing our total ownership interest to 
we do not expect any significant impact to our results of operations from these international initiatives in epsilon revenue increased to million and adjusted ebitda increased to million for the year ended december  these increases were driven primarily by the acquisition of aspen marketing holdings  inc  or aspen  in may and the acquisition of hmi in november during the year ended december   epsilon announced new agreements with regis corporation  a global leader in the hair care industry  to provide a robust email marketing platform  with walgreens  the nation s largest drugstore chain  in support of its balance rewards program  with guideposts  a leading publisher of inspirational magazines and digital content  to provide comprehensive database marketing services  and with northwestern mutual life insurance company to manage and deploy their permission based email newsletters and email marketing initiatives

discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
allowance for loan loss 
we maintain an allowance for loan loss at a level that is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in credit card receivables 
the allowance for loan loss covers forecasted uncollectable principal as well as unpaid interest and fees 
the allowance for loan loss is evaluated monthly for adequacy 
in estimating the allowance for principal loan losses  we utilize a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card receivables 
migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a credit card receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off 
the allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan loss 
charge offs of principal amounts  net of recoveries  are deducted from the allowance 
net charge offs include the principal amount of losses from credit cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances  as well as bankrupt and deceased credit cardholders  less recoveries and exclude charged off interest  fees and fraud losses 
charged off interest and fees reduce finance charges  net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense 
credit card receivables  including unpaid interest and fees  are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days contractually past due  except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death 
credit card receivables  including unpaid interest and fees  associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged off at the end of each month subsequent to days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death  but in any case  not later than the day contractual time frame 
we record the actual charge offs for unpaid interest and fees as a reduction to finance charges  net 
in estimating the allowance for uncollectable unpaid interest and fees  we utilize historical charge off trends  analyzing actual charge offs for the prior three months 
the allowance is maintained through an adjustment to finance charges  net 

index in evaluating the allowance for loan loss for both principal and unpaid interest and fees  management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience  including seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
if management used different assumptions in estimating incurred net losses  the impact to the allowance for loan loss could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a basis point change in management s estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the allowance for loan loss at december   with a corresponding change in the provision for loan loss 
air miles reward program 
because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an air miles reward mile is issued  the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred 
we allocate the proceeds from issuances of air miles reward miles into two components as follows redemption element 
the redemption element is the larger of the two components 
revenue related to the redemption element is based on the estimated fair value 
for this component  we recognize revenue at the time an air miles reward mile is redeemed  or for those air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base  known as breakage  over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
service element 
for this component  which consists of marketing and administrative services  revenue is determined in accordance with asu it is initially deferred and then amortized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
with the adoption of asu  the residual method is no longer utilized for new sponsor agreements entered into or existing sponsor agreements that are materially modified after january   for these agreements  we measure the service element at its estimated selling price 
should one of the air miles reward program top five sponsors materially modify or renew its agreement  it could shift the allocation of deferred revenue between the service element and redemption element 
under certain of our contracts  a portion of the proceeds is paid to us upon the issuance of air miles reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption and therefore  we do not have a redemption obligation related to these contracts 
revenue is recognized at the time of redemption 
under such contracts  the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and revenue is recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
amounts for revenue related to the redemption element and service element are recorded in redemption revenue and transaction revenue  respectively  in the consolidated statements of income 
the amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
based on our historical analysis  we make a determination as to average life of an air miles reward mile 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile is months 
as of december   the estimate of breakage was changed from to 
breakage and the life of an air miles reward mile are based on management s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis  current run rates and other pertinent factors  such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure 
based on the analysis of historical redemption trends and additional statistical analysis performed  including the impact of changes in the program structure  we determined that our estimate of breakage as of december  has changed from to 
the change in estimate will have no impact on the total redemption liability  but it will reduce the amount of deferred breakage by approximately million that is expected to be recognized over the remaining life of the air miles reward mile 
this change in estimate is expected to reduce earnings before taxes by approximately million in  million in  million in and million in as of december   we had billion in deferred revenue related to the air miles reward program that will be recognized in the future 
further information is provided in note  deferred revenue  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc   compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of asc  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the awards requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
see note  stockholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the application of asc income taxes 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of  and guidance surrounding  income tax laws and regulations change over time 
changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions and further information regarding asc

we use adjusted ebitda as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments 
adjusted ebitda is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses 
adjusted ebitda eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets  including certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations 
a limitation of this measure  however  is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses 
management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets  as well as asset sales through other financial measures  such as capital expenditures  investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda also eliminates the non cash effect of stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense is not included in the measurement of segment adjusted ebitda provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations 
therefore  we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is not intended to represent funds available for dividends  reinvestment or other discretionary uses  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap

asset quality our delinquency and net charge off rates reflect  among other factors  the credit risk of our private label credit card receivables  the success of our collection and recovery efforts  and general economic conditions 
delinquencies 
a credit card account is contractually delinquent when we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder s statement 
our policy is to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts beyond days  except in limited circumstances  until the credit card account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged off  typically at days delinquent 
when an account becomes delinquent  a message is printed on the credit cardholder s billing statement requesting payment 
after an account becomes days past due  a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent 
the collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account 
if we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in house collection efforts  we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts 

index the following table presents the delinquency trends of our credit card portfolio december  of total december  of total in thousands  except percentages receivables outstanding principal principal receivables balances contractually delinquent to days to days or more days total net charge offs 
our net charge offs include the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances  as well as bankrupt and deceased credit cardholders  less recoveries and exclude charged off interest  fees and fraud losses 
charged off interest and fees reduce finance charges  net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense 
credit card receivables  including unpaid interest and fees  are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days contractually past due  except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death 
credit card receivables  including unpaid interest and fees  associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged off at the end of each month subsequent to days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death  but in any case  not later than the day contractual time frame 
the net charge off rate is calculated by dividing net charge offs of principal receivables for the period by the average credit card receivables for the period 
average credit card receivables represent the average balance of the cardholder receivables at the beginning of each month in the periods indicated 
the following table presents our net charge offs for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands  except percentages average credit card receivables net charge offs of principal receivables net charge offs as a percentage of average credit card receivables we acquired the credit card receivables of the bon ton stores  inc and the talbots  inc in july and august  respectively

liquidity sources 
in addition to cash generated from operating activities  our primary sources of liquidity include our credit card securitization program  deposits issued by comenity bank and comenity capital bank  our credit agreement and issuances of equity securities 
in addition to our efforts to renew and expand our current liquidity sources  we continue to seek new funding sources

as of december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants 
see note  debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt 
deposits 
we utilize money market deposits and certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities and fund securitization enhancement requirements of our bank subsidiaries  comenity bank and comenity capital bank 
beginning january   comenity bank and comenity capital bank offered a demand deposit program through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms 
as of december   comenity bank and comenity capital bank had issued million in money market deposits with interest rates that range from to 
money market deposits are redeemable on demand by the customer and  as such  have no scheduled maturity date 
comenity bank and comenity capital bank issue certificates of deposit in denominations of  and  respectively  in various maturities ranging between two months and seven years and with effective annual interest rates ranging from to 
as of december   we had billion of certificates of deposit outstanding 
certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements 
securitization program 
we sell a majority of the credit card receivables originated by comenity bank to wfn credit company  llc  which in turn sells them to world financial network credit card master trust  world financial network credit card master note trust  world financial network credit card master note trust ii and world financial network credit card master trust iii  or collectively  the wfn trusts  as part of our credit card securitization program  which has been in existence since january we also sell our credit card receivables originated by comenity capital bank to world financial capital credit company  llc  which in turn sells them to world financial capital master note trust  or the wfc trust 
these securitization programs are the primary vehicle through which we finance comenity bank s and comenity capital bank s credit card receivables 
as of december   the wfn trusts and the wfc trust had approximately billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread deposits  additional receivables and subordinated classes 
the credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the wfn trusts and the wfc trust and by the performance of the private label credit cards in these credit card securitization trusts 
historically  we have used both public and private term asset backed securities transactions as well as private conduit facilities as sources of funding for our credit card receivables 
private conduit facilities have been used to accommodate seasonality needs and to bridge to completion of asset backed securitization transactions 
we have secured and continue to secure the necessary commitments to fund our portfolio of securitized credit card receivables originated by comenity bank and comenity capital bank 
however  certain of these commitments are short term in nature and subject to renewal 
there is not a guarantee that these funding sources  when they mature  will be renewed on similar terms or at all as they are dependent on the asset backed securitization markets at the time 
at december   we had billion of asset backed securities debt owed to securitization investors  of which billion is due within the next months 

index the following table shows the maturities of borrowing commitments as of december  for the wfn trusts and the wfc trust by year and thereafter total in thousands term notes conduit facilities total amount represents borrowing capacity  not outstanding borrowings 
total amounts do not include billion of debt issued by the credit card securitization trusts  which was retained by us and has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
early amortization events as defined within each asset backed securitization transaction are generally driven by asset performance 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely for an early amortization event to occur due to asset performance 
however  if an early amortization event were declared  the trustee of the particular credit card securitization trust would retain the interest in the receivables along with the excess interest income that would otherwise be paid to our bank subsidiary until the credit card securitization investors were fully repaid 
the occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit or negate our ability to securitize additional credit card receivables 
see note  debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our asset backed securities debt 
in february  world financial network credit card master note trust issued million of term asset backed securities to investors 
the offering consisted of million of class a series a asset backed term notes that have a fixed interest rate of per year and mature in february in addition  we retained an aggregate of million of subordinated classes of the term asset backed notes that will be eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 
repurchase of equity securities 
during   and  we repurchased approximately million  million  and million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of million  million  and million  respectively

purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms  including the following fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur 
purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table 
purchase obligations include purchase commitments under our air miles reward program  minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services 
we believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments 

index inflation and seasonality although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation 
for the most part  we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale and technology  as well as decreases in technology and communication costs  to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
our revenues  earnings and cash flows are affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the third and fourth quarter and  to a lesser extent  during the first quarter as credit card balances are paid down 
legislative and regulatory matters in october  our bank subsidiaries  world financial network bank and world financial capital bank  changed their names to comenity bank and comenity capital bank  respectively 
during the third quarter of  comenity bank changed its location to wilmington  delaware through the merger of the bank with an interim banking association organized under the laws of the united states and located in wilmington  delaware 
none of the bank s assets  liabilities or contemplated business purposes changed as a result of the merger 
effective august   comenity bank converted from a national banking association and limited purpose credit card bank to a delaware state fdic insured bank and limited purpose credit card bank 
comenity bank is regulated  supervised and examined by the state of delaware and the fdic 
comenity bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the state of delaware and the fdic 
comenity capital bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by both the fdic and the state of utah 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  both comenity bank and comenity capital bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
both comenity bank and comenity capital bank are limited in the amounts that they can pay as dividends to us 
quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require comenity bank and comenity capital bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to risk weighted assets and of tier capital to average assets 
under the regulations  a well capitalized institution must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive order 
an adequately capitalized institution must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least  but is allowed in some cases 
under these guidelines  comenity bank and comenity capital bank are considered well capitalized 
as of december   comenity capital bank s tier capital ratio was  total capital ratio was and leverage ratio was  and comenity capital bank was not subject to a capital directive order 
as of december   comenity bank s tier capital ratio was  total capital ratio was and leverage ratio was  and comenity bank was not subject to a capital directive order 
on april   the sec proposed revised rules for asset backed securities offerings that  if adopted  would substantially change the disclosure  reporting and offering process for public and private offerings of asset backed securities  including those offered under our credit card securitization program 
on july   the sec re proposed certain rules relating to the registrant and transaction requirements for the shelf registration of asset backed securities 
if the revised rules for asset backed securities are adopted in their current form  issuers of publicly offered asset backed securities would be required to disclose more information regarding the underlying assets 
in addition  the proposals would alter the safe harbor standards for the private placement of asset backed securities to impose informational requirements similar to those that would apply to registered public offerings of such securities 
the sec also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the exemptions that our credit card securitization trusts relied on in our credit card securitization program to avoid registration as investment companies 
the form that these rules may ultimately take is uncertain at this time  but such rules may impact our ability or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future 
on march   the sec  the fdic  the board of governors of the federal reserve system and certain other banking regulators proposed regulations that would mandate a five percent risk retention requirement for securitizations 
we cannot predict at this time whether our existing credit card securitization programs will satisfy the new regulatory requirements or whether structural changes to those programs will be necessary 
such risk retention requirements may impact our ability or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future 

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include interest rate risk  credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities 
our total borrowing costs were approximately million for to manage our risk from market interest rates  we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in addition  through the wfn trusts and the wfc trust  we enter into derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on related financial instruments or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis  which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on pre tax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 
in  a increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to fiscal year pre tax income of approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a comparable increase to pre tax income 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the appropriateness of the related assumptions 
credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers 
our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances 
to minimize our risk of credit card loan write offs  we have developed automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to make risk based origination decisions when approving new accountholders  establishing their credit limits and applying our risk based pricing 
we also utilize a proprietary collection scoring algorithm to assess accounts for collections efforts if they become delinquent  after exhausting all in house collection efforts  we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and the canadian dollar through our significant canadian operations 
we generally do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our canadian operations 
a increase in the strength of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in pre tax income of million as of december  conversely  a corresponding decrease in the strength of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar would result in a comparable decrease to pre tax income 
redemption reward risk 
through our air miles reward program  we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards 
to minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs  we have multi year supply agreements with several canadian  us and international airlines  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards  which are typically lower cost per air miles reward mile than air travel  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of air miles reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using air miles reward miles alone  and periodically adjust the number of air miles reward miles required to be redeemed to obtain a reward 
a increase in the cost of rewards to satisfy redemptions would have resulted in a decrease in pre tax income of million  as of december  conversely  a corresponding decrease in the cost of rewards to satisfy redemptions would result in a comparable increase to pre tax income
