the information in this report reflects principally the financial condition and results of operations of the bank 
the bank s results of operations are primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is mainly the difference between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
the bank also generates non interest income  such as fee income on deposit accounts and merchant credit and debit card processing programs  investment services  income from its title abstract subsidiary  and net gains on sales of securities and loans 
the level of its non interest expenses  such as salaries and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  other general and administrative expenses  expenses from its title insurance subsidiary  and income tax expense  further affects the bank s net income

a cash dividend of per share was declared and paid in december for the fourth quarter of current environment on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was signed by the president 
the act permanently raised the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to  section b of the dodd frank act required the fdic to change the definition of the assessment base from which assessment fees are determined 
the new definition for the assessment base is the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution 
the financial reform legislation  among other things  created a new consumer financial protection bureau  tightened capital standards and resulted in new regulations that are expected to increase the cost of operations 
on june   the occ  the federal reserve and the fdic issued proposed rules that would revise capital calculations and requirements 
more specifically  the agencies are proposing to revise the risk based and leverage capital requirements consistent with the basel committee on banking supervision basel iii  implement a new common equity tier minimum capital requirement  increase the minimum tier capital requirement  implement a new supplementary leverage ratio  apply limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive payments if the bank does not hold a specified buffer of common equity tier capital in addition to the minimum risk based capital requirements  revise the advanced approaches risk based capital rules consistent with basel iii and revise the calculation of risk weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity 
since the second half of and continuing through  the financial markets experienced significant volatility resulting from the continued fallout of sub prime lending and the global liquidity crises 
various government initiatives along with eight rate cuts by the federal reserve totaling basis points were designed to improve liquidity for the distressed financial markets 
the objective of these efforts was to help consumers  reduce the potential surge of residential mortgage loan foreclosures and stabilize the banking system 
effective as of february   the federal reserve increased the discount rate basis points to 
the federal reserve stated that this rate change was intended to normalize their lending facility and to step away from emergency lending to banks 
from april through september the federal reserve decided to maintain the federal funds target rate between and basis points due to a continued national depressed housing market  tight credit markets and as an effort to foster employment 
these actions have resulted in a prolonged low interest rate environment reducing yields on interest earning assets and compressing the company s net interest margin 
in june  the fomc lowered its expectations for employment and gdp growth 
in september  the fomc noted that economic activity was increasing  the growth in unemployment had slowed and the housing market was beginning to show signs of improvement 
however  the fomc anticipates maintaining federal funds target rate at least through mid in order to support economic and job growth 
growth and service strategies have the potential to offset the compression on net interest margin with volume as the customer base grows through expanding the bank s footprint  while maintaining and developing existing relationships 
since  the bank has opened seven new branches 
the recent branch openings move the bank geographically westward and demonstrate its commitment to traditional growth through branch expansion 
in may  the bank acquired hsb which increased the bank s presence in an existing market with a branch located in the village of southampton 
in july  the bank converted the former hsb customers to the bank s core operating system 
management spent considerable time ensuring the transition progressed smoothly for hsb s former customers and shareholders 
management has demonstrated its ability to successfully integrate the former hsb customers and achieve expected cost savings while continuing to execute its business strategy 
management will continue to seek opportunities to expand its reach into other contiguous markets by network expansion  or through the addition of professionals with established customer relationships

critical accounting policies note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
our policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses is our most critical accounting policy 
this policy is important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policy and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying its application 
allowance for loan losses management considers the accounting policy on the allowance for loan losses to be the most critical and requires complex management judgment as discussed below 
the judgments made regarding the allowance for loan losses can have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances 
if the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  the company s earnings could decrease 
the bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis  with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans  repayment patterns  probable incurred losses  past loss experience  current economic conditions  and various types of concentrations of credit 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses  net of recoveries  are charged to the allowance 
individual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process including the procedures for impairment testing under fasb accounting standard codification asc no 
 receivables 
such valuation  which includes a review of loans for which full collectibility in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured  considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell  if any  or the present value of expected future cash flows  or the loan s observable market value 
any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan 
pursuant to our policy  loan losses must be charged off in the period the loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
assumptions and judgments by management  in conjunction with outside sources  are used to determine whether full collectibility of a loan is not reasonably assured 
these assumptions and judgments are also used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan s observable market value 
individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired 
for collateral dependent impaired loans  appraisals are performed by certified general appraisers for commercial properties or certified residential appraisers for residential properties whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the company 
once received  the credit administration department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources  such as recent market data or industry wide statistics 
on a quarterly basis  the company compares the actual selling price of collateral that has been sold  based on these independent sources  as well as recent appraisals associated with current loan origination activity  to the most recent appraised value to determine if additional adjustments should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value 
adjustments to fair value are made only when the analysis indicates a probable decline in collateral values 
individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired 
the results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses 
loan pool valuation allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risks associated with our lending activities  but which  unlike individual allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
pool evaluations are broken down into loans with homogenous characteristics by loan type and include commercial real estate mortgages  owner and non owner occupied  multi family mortgages  residential real estate mortgages  first lien and home equity  commercial loans  secured page 
table of contents and unsecured  installment consumer loans  and real estate construction and land loans 
the determination of the adequacy of the valuation allowance is a process that takes into consideration a variety of factors 
the bank has developed a range of valuation allowances necessary to adequately provide for probable incurred losses inherent in each pool of loans 
we consider our own charge off history along with the growth in the portfolio as well as the bank s credit administration and asset management philosophies and procedures  and concentrations in the portfolio when determining the allowances for each pool 
in addition  we evaluate and consider the credit s risk rating which includes management s evaluation of cash flow  collateral and trends in current values  guarantor support  financial disclosures  industry trends and strength of borrowers management  the impact that economic and market conditions may have on the portfolio as well as known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
finally  we evaluate and consider the allowance ratios and coverage percentages of both peer group and regulatory agency data 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  even though they are based on objective data  it is management s interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance 
if the evaluations prove to be incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio  resulting in additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the credit risk committee is comprised of members of both management and the board of directors 
the adequacy of the allowance is analyzed quarterly  with any adjustment to a level deemed appropriate by the credit risk committee  based on its risk assessment of the entire portfolio 
based on the credit risk committee s review of the classified loans and the overall allowance levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at december   management believes the allowance for loan losses has been established at levels sufficient to cover the probable incurred losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic  market or other conditions 
changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination 
for additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses  see note to the consolidated financial statements

for purposes of this table  changes that are not due solely to volume or rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate

loans of approximately million or of total loans at december  were categorized as classified loans compared to million or at december  and million or at december  classified loans include loans with page 
table of contents credit quality indicators with the internally assigned grades of special mention  substandard and doubtful 
these loans are categorized as classified loans as management has information that indicates the borrower may not be able to comply with the present repayment terms 
these loans are subject to increased management attention and their classification is reviewed at least quarterly 
the decrease in the levels of classified loans reflects the current economic environment 
the higher classified loans as of december  primarily related to a million increase in the special mention category as well as acquired classified loans from the hsb merger 
at december   approximately million of these loans were commercial real estate cre loans which were well secured with real estate as collateral 
of the million of cre loans  million were current and million were past due 
in addition  all but million of the cre loans have personal guarantees 
at december   approximately million of classified loans were residential real estate loans with million current and million past due 
commercial  financial  and agricultural loans represented million of classified loans and million was current and million was past due 
approximately million of classified loans represented real estate construction and land loans  which were all current 
all real estate construction and land loans are well secured with collateral 
the remaining million in classified loans are consumer loans that are unsecured and current  have personal guarantees and demonstrate sufficient cash flow to pay the loans 
due to the structure and nature of the credits  we do not expect to sustain a material loss on these relationships

as of december  and december   the company had impaired loans as defined by fasb asc no 
 receivables of million and million  respectively 
for a loan to be considered impaired  management determines after review whether it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
management applies its normal loan review procedures in making these judgments 
impaired loans include individually classified nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructured tdr loans 
for impaired loans  the bank evaluates the impairment of the loan in accordance with fasb asc impairment is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
for loans that are collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the fair value of the loan 
the fair value of the collateral is determined based upon recent appraised values 
the fair value of the collateral or present value of expected cash flows is compared to the carrying value to determine if any write down or specific loan loss allowance allocation is required 
these methods of fair value measurement for impaired loans are considered level within the fair value hierarchy described in fasb asc nonaccrual loans decreased million to million or of total loans at december  from million or of total loans at december  approximately million of the nonaccrual loans at december  and million at december   represent troubled debt restructured loans 
as of december  two of the borrowers with loans totaling million are complying with the modified terms of the loans and are currently making payments 
another borrower with loans totaling million is currently in default and foreclosure proceedings have been initiated 
the decrease in nonaccrual troubled debt restructured loans at december  was primarily due to one loan totaling million where the borrower has made six months of consecutive payments in accordance with the restructured terms and the loan is now a performing trouble debt restructure loan 
in addition  one loan had million in charge offs in nonaccrual troubled debt restructured loans are secured with collateral that has an appraised value of million

loans during  the company continued to experience growth trends in commercial and residential real estate lending 
the concentration of loans in our primary market areas may increase risk 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  the bank s loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial and residential real estate properties located in the bank s page 
table of contents principal lending area in suffolk county which is located on eastern long island 
the local economic conditions on eastern long island have a significant impact on the volume of loan originations and the quality of our loans  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans  and the value of collateral securing these loans 
a considerable decline in the general economic conditions caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond the company s control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of the company s operations 
additionally  while the company has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans  the majority of which are owner occupied  decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
the interest rates charged by the bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  the rates offered by its competitors  the bank s relationship with the customer  and the related credit risks of the transaction 
these factors are affected by general and economic conditions including  but not limited to  monetary policies of the federal government  including the federal reserve board  legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters 
the bank targets its business lending and marketing initiatives towards promotion of loans that primarily meet the needs of small to medium sized businesses 
these small to medium sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
if general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses  the results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
with respect to the underwriting of loans  there are certain risks  including the risk of non payment that is associated with each type of loan that the bank markets 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio at december  is secured by real estate 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio is comprised of commercial real estate loans 
multifamily loans represent of the bank s loan portfolio 
residential real estate mortgage loans represent of the bank s loan portfolio and include home equity lines of credit of approximately and residential mortgages of approximately of the bank s loan portfolio 
real estate construction and land loans comprise approximately of the bank s loan portfolio 
risks associated with a concentration in real estate loans include potential losses from fluctuating values of land and improved properties 
home equity loans represent loans originated in the bank s geographic markets with original loan to value ratios generally of or less 
the bank s residential mortgage portfolio includes approximately million in interest only mortgages 
the underwriting standards for interest only mortgages are consistent with the remainder of the loan portfolio and do not include any features that result in negative amortization 
the largest loan concentrations by industry are loans granted to lessors of commercial property both owner occupied and non owner occupied 
the bank uses conservative underwriting criteria to better insulate itself from a downturn in real estate values and economic conditions on eastern long island that could have a significant impact on the value of collateral securing the loans as well as the ability of customers to repay loans 
the remainder of the loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and consumer loans  which represent approximately of the bank s loan portfolio 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans are the cash flow of the business  the experience and quality of the borrowers management  the business climate  and the impact of economic factors 
the primary risks associated with consumer loans relate to the borrower  such as the risk of a borrower s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions or the amount and nature of a borrower s other existing indebtedness  and the value of the collateral securing the loan if the bank must take possession of the collateral 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of specific types of consumer loans within the portfolio 
the bank s policy for charging off loans is a multi step process 
a loan is considered a potential charge off when it is in default of either principal or interest for a period of  or days  depending upon the loan type  as of the end of the prior month 
in addition to date criteria  other triggering events may include  but are not limited to  notice of bankruptcy by the borrower or guarantor  death of the borrower  and deficiency balance from the sale of collateral 
these loans identified are presented for evaluation at the regular meeting of the credit risk committee 
a loan is charged off when a loss is reasonably assured 
the recovery of charged off balances is actively pursued until the potential for recovery has been exhausted  or until the expense of collection does not justify the recovery efforts

liquidity management addresses the ability of the company to meet financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet customer borrowing commitments  deposit withdrawals either on demand or contractual maturity  to repay other borrowings as they mature  to fund current and planned expenditures and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million as of december   and dividends from the bank 
cash available for distribution of dividends to shareholders of the company is primarily derived from dividends paid by the bank to the company 
during  the bank did not pay a cash dividend to the company 
prior regulatory approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of the bank s net income of that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years 
at december   the bank had million of retained net income available for dividends to the company 
in the event that the company subsequently expands its current operations  in addition to dividends from the bank  it will need to rely on its own earnings  additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs 
the company made a capital contribution of million to the bank during the twelve months ended december  the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year 
the levels of these assets are dependent upon the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
other sources of liquidity include loan and investment securities principal repayments and maturities  lines of credit with other financial institutions including the federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank  growth in core deposits and sources of wholesale funding such as brokered certificates of deposit 
while scheduled loan amortization  maturing securities and short term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit outflows  loans  and asset and liability management objectives 
historically  the bank has relied on its deposit base  drawn through its full service branches that serve its market area and local municipal deposits  as its principal source of funding 
the bank seeks to retain existing deposits and loans and maintain customer relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to its customers  while managing the overall cost of funds needed to finance its strategies

commitments may expire without being used 
off balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments  although material losses are not anticipated 
the same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans  often including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment

the company considers opportunities for stock repurchases carefully 
the company did not repurchase any shares in  or impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or in the same magnitude  as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve bank 
impact of prospective accounting standards for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note r of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management considers interest rate risk to be the most significant market risk for the company 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net income of the company as a result of changes in interest rates 
the company s primary earnings source is net interest income  which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the relationship between rates  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments  the level and composition of deposits and liabilities  and the credit quality of earning assets 
the company s objectives in its asset and liability management are to maintain a strong  stable net interest margin  to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks  to maintain adequate liquidity  and to reduce vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the company s asset and liability committee evaluates periodically  but at least four times a year  the impact of changes in market interest rates on assets and liabilities  net interest margin  capital and liquidity 
risk assessments are governed by policies and limits established by senior management  which are reviewed and approved by the full board of directors at least annually 
the economic environment continually presents uncertainties as to future interest rate trends 
the asset and liability committee regularly utilizes a page 
table of contents model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates  in order to be better able to respond to changes in interest rates 
at december   million or of the company s securities had fixed interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the value of the company s interest earning assets and in particular its securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest earning assets  which could adversely affect the company s stockholders equity and its results of operations if sold 
the company is also subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates also could affect the type fixed rate or adjustable rate and amount of loans originated by the company and the average life of loans and securities  which can impact the yields earned on the company s loans and securities 
in periods of decreasing interest rates  the average life of loans and securities held by the company may be shortened to the extent increased prepayment activity occurs during such periods which  in turn  may result in the investment of funds from such prepayments in lower yielding assets 
under these circumstances the company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may result in decreasing loan prepayments with respect to fixed rate loans and therefore an increase in the average life of such loans  may result in a decrease in loan demand  and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
the company utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
management routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon 
the simulation model captures the seasonality of the company s deposit flows and the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and the interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to the asset and liability policy limits that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon given a and basis point upward shift in interest rates and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a twelve month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s net interest income sensitivity analysis at december  change in interest potential change in net interest income rates in basis points change change dollars in thousands static the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shapes  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based upon perceived current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences may change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals  prepayment penalties and product preference changes and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to  or anticipating changes in interest rates and market conditions 
management considers interest rate risk to be the most significant market risk for the company 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net income of the company as a result of changes in interest rates
