overview we are a leading operator in the automotive retail industry 
as of december   we owned and operated franchises  representing brands of automobiles  at dealership locations and collision service centers in the us and franchises at ten dealerships and three collision centers in the uk through our dealerships  we sell new and used cars and light trucks  arrange related vehicle financing  service and insurance contracts  provide automotive maintenance and repair services  and sell vehicle parts 
our operations are primarily located in major metropolitan areas in alabama  california  florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  oklahoma  south carolina  and texas in the us and in the towns of brighton  chelmsford  chingford  farnborough  hailsham  harold wood  hindhead  southend  stanstead  and worthing in the uk as of december   our us retail network consisted of the following two regions with the number of dealerships they comprised a the east dealerships in alabama  florida  georgia  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  and south carolina and b the west dealerships in california  kansas  oklahoma  and texas 
each region is managed by a regional vice president who reports directly to our chief executive officer and is responsible for the overall performance of their regions  as well as for overseeing the market directors and dealership general managers that report to them 
each region is also managed by a regional chief financial officer who reports directly to our chief financial officer 
our dealerships in the uk are also managed locally with direct reporting responsibilities to our corporate management team 
we typically seek to acquire large  profitable  well established and well managed dealerships that are leaders in their respective market areas 
from january   through december   we have purchased franchises with expected annual revenues at the time of acquisition of billion and been granted nine new franchises by our manufacturers  with expected annual revenues at the time of acquisition of million 
in alone  we acquired one domestic  eight import  and seven luxury franchises with expected annual revenues at the time of acquisition of million 
we make disposition decisions based principally on the rate of return on our capital investment  the location of the dealership  our ability to leverage our cost structure  the brand  and existing real estate obligations 
from january  through december   we disposed of or terminated franchises with annual revenues of approximately million 
specifically  during  we disposed of three luxury and three import franchises with annual revenues of approximately million 
in the following discussion and analysis  we report certain performance measures of our newly acquired and disposed dealerships separately from those of our existing dealerships 
our operating results reflect the combined performance of each of our interrelated business activities  which include the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and parts  as well as service and collision repair services 
historically  each of these activities has been directly or indirectly impacted by a variety of supply demand factors  including vehicle inventories  consumer confidence  consumer discretionary spending  availability and affordability of consumer credit  manufacturer incentives  weather patterns  fuel prices  and interest rates 
for example  during periods of sustained economic downturn or significant supply demand imbalances  new vehicle sales may be negatively impacted as consumers tend to shift their purchases to used vehicles 
some consumers may even delay their purchasing decisions altogether  electing instead to repair their existing vehicles 
in such cases  however  we believe the new vehicle sales impact on our overall business is mitigated by our ability to offer other products and services  such as used vehicles and parts  service and collision repair services  as well as our ability to reduce our costs in response to lower sales 
we generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
this seasonality is generally attributable to consumer buying trends and the timing of manufacturer new vehicle model introductions 
in addition  in some regions of the us  vehicle purchases decline during the winter months due to inclement weather 
as a result  our revenues and operating income are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters 
other factors unrelated to seasonality  such as changes in economic condition and manufacturer incentive programs  may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income 
according to industry experts  the annual new unit sales for increased million units  or  to million units  compared to million units in for the year ended december   our total revenues increased from to billion and gross profit improved to billion 
for the years ended december  and  total revenues were billion and billion  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  gross profits were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we realized net income of million  or per diluted common share  and for the years ended december  and  we realized net income of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
in addition to the matters described above  the following factors impacted our financial condition and results of operations in   and 
table of contents year ended december  asset impairments we determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights related to three of our franchises did not exceed their carrying value and an impairment charge was required 
accordingly  we recorded a million pretax non cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter of we also recognized a total of million in pretax non cash asset impairment charges related to impairment of various long lived assets 
non cash interest expense our results were negatively impacted by million of non cash interest expense relative to the amortization of the discount associated with our notes and notes representing the impact of the accounting for convertible debt as required by financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  debt asc 
year ended december  asset impairments we recognized a total of million in pretax non cash asset impairment charges  primarily related to the impairment of held for sale assets of million and other various long lived assets of million 
non cash interest expense our results were negatively impacted by million of non cash interest expense relative to the amortization of the discount associated with our notes and notes representing the impact of the accounting for convertible debt as required by asc year ended december  asset impairments we recognized a total of million in pretax non cash asset impairment charges  primarily related to the impairment of assets held for sale and leasehold improvements  as well as other long term assets 
convertible debt offering and debt redemption we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes at par in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act which will mature on march   unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
in conjunction with using the proceeds of our notes offering  we completed the redemption of our then outstanding million face value senior subordinated notes notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes 
we incurred a million pretax charge in completing the redemption  consisting primarily of a million redemption premium  a million write off of unamortized bond discount and deferred costs and million of other debt extinguishment costs 
non cash interest expense our results were negatively impacted by million of non cash interest expense relative to the amortization of the discount associated with our notes and notes representing the impact of the accounting for convertible debt as required by asc these items  and other variances between the periods presented  are covered in the following discussion

throughout the following discussion  references are made to same store results and variances that are discussed in more detail in the results of operations section that follows 
over the course of  our industry experienced an increase in new vehicle unit sales 
while total industry sales are still low relative to years before  unit sales have risen from million for the twelve months ended december  to million in our new vehicle retail sales revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to this growth primarily reflects an increase in new vehicle unit sales of for the year ended december   reflecting stronger consumer confidence  improved inventory levels in our import brands that had experienced shortages as a result of the march natural disaster in japan  and strong execution by our operating team 
new vehicle retail gross margin declined during the year ended december  primarily as industry wide new vehicle inventory levels returned to more normalized levels following the shortage in most of our used vehicle results are directly affected by economic conditions  the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles and new vehicle financing  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins  the availability of consumer credit  and our ability to effectively manage the level and quality of our overall used vehicle inventory 
our used vehicle retail sales revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to this growth primarily reflects an increase in the used vehicle unit sales of for the year ended december  as compared to the improving economic environment that has benefited new vehicle sales also supported improved used vehicle demand 
used vehicle gross margins declined for the twelve months ended december   due to a decrease in gross profit per unit sold coupled with an increase in the sales price per unit 
our parts and service sales increased by  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  primarily driven by increases in our customer pay parts and service business and in our collision business  as well as in our wholesale parts business 
our parts and service margins for increased to  up basis points from  primarily as a result of an increase in internal work generated by increased new and used retail vehicle sales volumes 
our consolidated finance and insurance income per retail unit sold increased to  for the twelve months of  as compared to  in  primarily driven by increases in income per contract from our finance  insurance  and other product offerings  as well as an increase in penetration rates for finance and vehicle service contracts 
our total gross margin decreased basis points to for the twelve months ended december   primarily due to the shift in business mix towards the lower margin new and used vehicle businesses 

table of contents our consolidated sg a expenses increased in absolute dollars for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  primarily as a result of the correlation to vehicle sales volumes  as well as dealership acquisitions 
however  sg a as a percentage of gross profit declined basis points to  for the year ended december  from the same period in  reflecting ongoing cost control and the leverage on our cost structure that higher revenues and gross profits provide 
for the twelve months ended december   floorplan interest expense increased  as compared to  primarily due to higher weighted average borrowings as our import brand inventories returned to more normalized levels following the march natural disasters in japan and recent acquisitions 
other interest expense increased for the year ended december   largely due to an increase in real estate related borrowings 
the combination of all of these factors  including million of asset impairments  resulted in an operating margin of for the twelve months ended december   which reflects a basis point decrease from we address these items further  and other variances between the periods presented  in the results of operations section below 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note of our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting polices and estimates  for a discussion of those most recent pronouncements that impact us 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting gaap principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates and policies 
we have identified below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies and estimates that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary or significant accounting policies and estimates  for further discussion of all our significant accounting policies and estimates 
inventories 
we carry new  used and demonstrator vehicle inventories  as well as parts and accessories inventories  at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis for parts and accessories or market in the consolidated balance sheets 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus the cost of reconditioning  cost of equipment added and transportation cost 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of our automobile manufacturers 
this assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on our consolidated balance sheets and as a reduction to cost of sales in our statements of operations as the vehicles are sold 
at december  and  inventory cost had been reduced by million and million  respectively  for interest assistance received from manufacturers 
new vehicle cost of sales was reduced by million  million  and million for interest assistance received related to vehicles sold for the years ended december    and  respectively 
manufacturers interest assistance ranged  over the past three years  from approximately of our quarterly floorplan interest expense in the first quarter of to for the third quarter of  and was for the fourth quarter of as the market value of inventory typically declines over time  we establish new and used vehicle reserves based on our historical loss experience and considerations of current market trends 
these reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of inventory on hand 
used vehicles are complex to value as there is no standardized source for determining exact values and each vehicle and each market in which we operate is unique 
as a result  the value of each used vehicle taken at trade in  or purchased at auction  is determined based on industry data  primarily accessed via our used vehicle management software and the industry expertise of the responsible used vehicle manager 
valuation risk is partially mitigated  by the speed at which we turn this inventory 
at december   our used vehicle days supply was days 
goodwill 
as of december   we defined our reporting units as each of our two regions in the us and the us goodwill represents the excess  at the date of acquisition  of the purchase price of the business acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
annually in the fourth quarter  based on the carrying values of our regions as of october st  we perform a fair value and potential impairment assessment of goodwill 
an impairment analysis is done more frequently if certain events or circumstances arise that would indicate a change in the fair value of the non financial asset has occurred ie  an impairment indicator 

table of contents in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit to its respective fair value 
this represents the first step of the impairment test 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets  we are then required to proceed to step two of the impairment test 
step two involves allocating the calculated fair value to all of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit as if the calculated fair value was the purchase price in a business combination 
to the extent the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value under step two of the impairment test  a non cash impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded 
we use a combination of the discounted cash flow  or income approach weighted  and the market approach weighted to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
included in the discounted cash flow are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  future gross margins  future sg a expenses and an estimated wacc 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
specifically  with regards to the valuation assumptions utilized in the income approach as of december   we based our analysis on a slow recovery back to a seasonally adjusted annual rate saar of million units by for the market approach  we utilize recent market multiples of guideline companies for both revenue weighted and pretax net income weighted 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of the industry  recent transactions and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
if any one of the above assumptions change  in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in the estimated fair value could result in a material non cash impairment charge to the goodwill associated with our reporting unit s 
intangible franchise rights 
our only significant identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers  which are recorded at an individual dealership level 
we expect these franchise agreements to continue for an indefinite period and  when these agreements do not have indefinite terms  we believe that renewal of these agreements can be obtained without substantial cost 
as such  we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period and  therefore  the carrying amounts of the franchise rights are not amortized 
franchise rights acquired in business acquisitions prior to july   were recorded and amortized as part of goodwill and remain as part of goodwill at december  and in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
since july   intangible franchise rights acquired in business combinations have been recorded as distinctly separate intangible assets and  in accordance with guidance primarily codified within asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we evaluate these franchise rights for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  based on the carrying values of our individual dealerships as of october st  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment has occurred 
in performing our impairment assessments  we test the carrying value of each individual franchise right that was recorded using a direct value method discounted cash flow model  or income approach  specifically the excess earnings method 
included in this analysis are assumptions  at a dealership level  regarding the cash flows directly attributable to the franchise right  revenue growth rates  future gross margins and future sg a expenses 
using an estimated wacc  estimated residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements  we calculate the fair value of each dealership s franchise rights after considering estimated values for tangible assets  working capital and workforce 
if any one of the above assumptions change or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in the intangible franchise rights estimated fair value could result in a non cash impairment charge to the intangible franchise right associated with the applicable dealership 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  asset impairments  and note to our consolidated financial statements  intangible franchise rights and goodwill  for additional details regarding our intangible franchise rights 
revenue recognition 
revenues from vehicle sales  parts sales  and vehicle service are recognized upon completion of the sale or service and delivery to the customer 
conditions to completing a sale include having an agreement with the customer  including pricing  and the sales price must be reasonably expected to be collected 
we include revenues from our collision center operations in parts and services sales 
we record the profit we receive for arranging vehicle fleet transactions net in other finance and insurance revenues 
since all sales of new vehicles must occur through franchised new vehicle dealerships  the dealerships effectively act as agents for the automobile manufacturers in completing sales of vehicles to fleet customers 
as these customers typically order the vehicles  we have no significant inventory risk 
additionally  fleet customers generally receive special purchase incentives from the automobile manufacturers and we receive only a nominal fee for facilitating the transactions 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental agencies are not included in total revenues 
we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers and wholesale financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of insurance and vehicle service contracts to customers 
further  through agreements with certain vehicle service contract administrators  we earn volume incentive rebates and interest income on reserves  as well as participate in the underwriting profits of the products 
we may be charged back for unearned financing  insurance contract or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
revenues from these fees are recorded at 
table of contents the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future amounts which might be charged back is established based on our historical chargeback results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
while chargeback results vary depending on the type of contract sold  a change in the historical chargeback results used in determining estimates of future amounts which might be charged back would have changed the reserve at december   by million 
self insured property and casualty reserves 
we purchase insurance policies for worker s compensation  liability  auto physical damage  property  pollution  employee medical benefits and other risks consisting of large deductibles and or self insured retentions 
annually we engage a third party actuary to conduct a study of the exposures under the self insured portion of our worker s compensation and general liability insurance programs for all open policy years 
in the interim  we review the estimates within the study and monitor actual experience for unusual variances 
the appropriate adjustments are made to the accrual  based upon these procedures 
actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on historical claims experience adjusted for loss trending and loss development factors 
changes in the frequency or severity of claims from historical levels could influence our reserve for claims and our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in the actuarially determined estimate of aggregate future losses would have changed the reserve for these losses at december   by million 
our auto physical damage insurance coverage contains an annual aggregate retention stop loss limit 
for policy years ended prior to october   our workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage included aggregate retention stop loss limits in addition to a per claim deductible limit stop loss plans 
due to historical experience in both claims frequency and severity  the likelihood of breaching the aggregate retention limits described above was deemed remote  and as such  we elected not to purchase this stop loss coverage for the policy year beginning november  and for each subsequent year no stop loss plans 
our exposure per claim under the no stop loss plans is limited to million per occurrence  with unlimited exposure on the number of claims up to million that we may incur 
our maximum potential exposure under all of the stop loss plans totaled million at december   before consideration of amounts previously paid or accruals recorded related to our loss projections 
after consideration of the amounts paid or accrued  the remaining potential loss exposure under the stop loss plans totaled million at december  fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are estimated using various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions  and those requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property and equipment and intangible franchise rights  with the remaining attributable to goodwill  if any 
we utilize third party experts to determine the fair values of property and equipment purchased and our fair value model to determine the fair value of our franchise rights 
derivative financial instruments 
one of our primary market risk exposures is increasing interest rates 
interest rate derivatives are used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions 
we follow the requirements of guidance primarily codified within asc  derivatives and hedging asc pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
asc requires us to recognize all derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in interest expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in interest expense 
all of our interest rate hedges were designated as cash flow hedges and were deemed to be effective at december    and we measure interest rate derivative instruments utilizing an income approach valuation technique  converting future amounts of cash flows to a single present value in order to obtain a transfer exit price within the bid and ask spread that is most representative of the fair value of our derivative instruments 
in measuring fair value  the option pricing black scholes present value technique is utilized for all of our derivative instruments 
this option pricing technique utilizes a one month london interbank offered rate libor forward yield curve  obtained from an independent external service provider  matched to the identical maturity term of the instrument being measured 
observable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation technique incorporate identical contractual notional amounts  fixed coupon rates  periodic terms for interest payments and contract maturity 
also included in our fair value estimate is a consideration of credit risk 
because the interest rate derivative instruments were in a liability position  an estimate of our own credit risk was included in the fair value calculation  based upon the spread between the one month libor yield curve and the average and year retail rate for bb s p rated companies  or  as of december  we have determined the valuation measurement inputs of these derivative instruments to maximize the use of observable inputs that market participants would use in pricing similar or identical instruments and market data obtained from independent sources  which is readily observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the derivative instrument 
further  the valuation measurement inputs minimize the use of 
table of contents unobservable inputs 
accordingly  we have classified the derivatives within level of the asc hierarchy framework in note to our consolidated financial statements  fair value measurements 
we validate the outputs of our valuation technique by comparison to valuations from the respective counterparties 
income taxes 
currently  we operate in different states in the us and in the us  each of which has unique tax rates and payment calculations 
as the amount of income generated in each jurisdiction varies from period to period  our estimated effective tax rate can vary based on the proportion of taxable income generated in each jurisdiction 
deferred income taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the underlying assets are realized or liabilities are settled 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each tax position must satisfy a threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional information 
we have recognized deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  that we believe will be realized  based primarily on the assumption of future taxable income 
to the extent that we have determined that net income attributable to certain state jurisdictions will not be sufficient to realize certain net operating losses  a corresponding valuation allowance has been established 
results of operations the same store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison  commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us and  in the case of dispositions  ending with the last full month it was owned by us

in addition  the recovery from the natural disasters in japan in by our major import brand original equipment manufacturer oem partners led to the normalization of inventory levels and bolstered new vehicle sales 
our same store new vehicle retail sales revenues increased  primarily as a result of increased new vehicle retail unit sales of  for the year ended december   as compared to from a mix standpoint  we generated the majority of the volume increase through our import brands  which sold more units in  as compared to same store revenues for the twelve months ended december  improved in our import brands  as compared to the same period in same store revenues also increased in by and in our domestic and luxury categories  respectively  as compared to the mix shift effect on revenues from the normalization of import brand inventories contributed to a decline in our same store revenues per retail unit pru  which decreased to  in  as compared to the level of retail sales  as well as our own ability to retain or grow market share during any future period  is difficult to predict

our same store retail new car unit sales decreased by  as compared with the same period in the inventory shortages that we experienced in following the natural disasters in japan were concentrated in our toyota and honda brands  which are heavily weighted towards cars 
our same store new vehicle gross profits improved for the year ended december  same store gross profit pru increased by to  this gross profit pru improvement consisted primarily of increases in our import brands resulting from the limited availability of inventory as discussed above 
however  we experienced increases in gross profit pru in predominantly all of the brands that we represent 
as a result  our same store new vehicle gross margin grew basis points from in to in most manufacturers offer interest assistance to offset floorplan interest charges incurred in connection with inventory purchases 
this assistance varies by manufacturer  but generally provides for a defined amount  adjusted periodically for changes in market interest rates  regardless of our actual floorplan interest rate or the length of time for which the inventory is financed 
we record these incentives as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as the vehicles are sold  impacting the gross profit and gross margin detailed above 
the total assistance recognized in cost of goods sold during the years ended december    and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
the amount of interest assistance we recognize in a given period is primarily a function of a the mix of units being sold  as domestic brands tend to provide more assistance  b the specific terms of the respective manufacturers interest assistance programs and market interest 
table of contents rates  c the average wholesale price of inventory sold  and d our rate of inventory turnover 
the increase in floorplan interest assistance from to was primarily the result of increased inventory turnover 
in effect as of december   we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million  at a weighted average one month libor of 
we record the majority of the impact of the periodic settlements of these swaps as a component of floorplan interest expense  effectively hedging a substantial portion of the variable component of our total floorplan interest expense and further mitigating the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
over the past three years  manufacturers interest assistance as a percentage of our total consolidated floorplan interest expense has ranged from in the first quarter of to in the third quarter of and was for the fourth quarter of we continue to aggressively manage our new vehicle inventory in response to the rapidly changing market conditions

we  acting through our subsidiaries  are the lessee under many real estate leases that provide for our use of the respective dealership premises 
generally  our real estate and facility leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three additional five year terms  at our option 
pursuant to these leases  our subsidiaries generally agree to indemnify the lessor and other parties from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises  including environmental liabilities  or a breach of the lease by the lessee 
additionally  from time to time  we enter into agreements in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the purchaser  or other parties  from certain liabilities or costs arising in connection with the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of business in connection with purchases or sales of goods and services  we enter into agreements that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability would be limited by the terms of the applicable agreement 
from time to time  primarily in connection with dealership dispositions  we assign or sublet to the dealership purchaser our interests in any real property leases associated with such dealerships 
in general  we retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform  whether such performance is required prior to or following the assignment or subletting of the lease 
additionally  we generally remain subject to the terms of any guarantees made by us in connection with such leases 
although we generally have indemnification rights against the assignee or sublessee in the event of non performance under these leases  as well as certain defenses  and we presently have no reason to believe that we will be called on to perform under any such assigned leases or subleases  we 
table of contents estimate that lessee rental payment obligations during the remaining terms of these leases are approximately million as of december  our exposure under these leases is difficult to estimate and there can be no assurance that any performance by us required under these leases would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 
we may be called on to perform other obligations under these leases  such as environmental remediation of the leased premises or repair of the leased premises upon termination of the lease 
however  we presently have no reason to believe that we will be called on to so perform and such obligations cannot be quantified at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including interest rate risk  and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we address these risks through a program of risk management which includes the use of derivative instruments 
the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which we are a party at december   and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates chosen for the following estimated sensitivity analysis are considered to be reasonable near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
however  since it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
interest rates 
we have interest rate risk in our variable rate debt obligations 
our policy is to monitor the effects of market changes in interest rates and manage our interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps 
as of december   the outstanding principal amounts of our notes and notes totaled million and million  respectively  and had fair values of million and million  respectively 
the carrying amounts of our notes and notes were million and million  respectively  at december  as of december   we had  million of variable rate floorplan borrowings outstanding  million of variable rate mortgage facility borrowings outstanding  and million of other variable rate real estate related borrowings outstanding 
based on the aggregate amount of variable rate borrowings outstanding as of december   and before the impact of our interest rate swaps described below  a basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
after consideration of the interest rate swaps described below  a basis point change would have yielded a net annual change of million in annual interest expense based on the variable rate borrowings outstanding as of december  this interest rate sensitivity increased from primarily as a result of the increase in variable rate borrowings 
our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to our variable rate floorplan borrowings is partially mitigated by manufacturers interest assistance  which in some cases is influenced by changes in market based variable interest rates 
we reflect interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle inventory cost until the associated vehicle is sold 
during the years ended december  and december   we recognized million and million of interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales  respectively 
for the past three years  the reduction to our new vehicle cost of sales has ranged from of our floorplan interest expense in the first quarter of to in the third quarter of  and was for the fourth quarter of although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future interest assistance  it is our expectation  based on historical practice that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased assistance from certain manufacturers 
we use interest rate swaps to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements  when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
as of december   we held interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of million that fixed our underlying one month libor at a weighted average rate of 
in addition  during and  we entered into ten additional interest rate swaps with forward start dates between december and december and expiration dates between december and december as of december   the aggregate notional value of these ten forward starting swaps was million and the weighted average interest rate of these swaps was 
these hedge instruments are designed to convert floating rate vehicle floorplan payables under our revolving credit facility and variable rate mortgage facility borrowings to fixed rate debt 
we entered into these swaps with financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of interest rate swaps is impacted by the forward one month libor curve and the length of time to maturity of the swap contracts 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  totaled million 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly 
table of contents offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  the ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
as of december   all of our derivative contracts were determined to be effective 
a basis point change in the interest rates of our swaps would have resulted in a million change to our interest expense for the year ended december  foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had dealership operations in the uk  which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the functional currency of our uk subsidiaries is the pound sterling 
we intend to remain permanently invested in these foreign operations and  as such  do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations that may impact our investment in our uk subsidiaries 
if we change our intent with respect to such international investment  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
a change in average exchange rates for the pound sterling versus the us dollar would have resulted in a million change to our revenues for the year ended december
