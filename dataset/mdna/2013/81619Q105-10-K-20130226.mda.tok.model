item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read this discussion together with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere herein 
overview we believe that we are one of the largest operators of both specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the united states based on number of facilities 
as of december   we operated long term acute care hospitals and acute medical rehabilitation hospitals in states  and outpatient rehabilitation clinics in states and the district of columbia 
we also provide medical rehabilitation services on a contracted basis to nursing homes  hospitals  assisted living and senior care centers  schools and work sites 
we began operations in under the leadership of our current management team 
as of december  we had operations in states and the district of columbia 
we manage our company through two business segments  our specialty hospital segment and our outpatient rehabilitation segment 
we had net operating revenues of  million for the year ended december  of this total  we earned approximately of our net operating revenues from our specialty hospitals and approximately from our outpatient rehabilitation business 
our specialty hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve the needs of long term stay acute patients and hospitals designed to serve patients that require intensive medical rehabilitation care 
patients are typically admitted to our specialty hospitals from general acute care hospitals 
these patients have specialized needs  and serious and often complex medical conditions such as respiratory failure  neuromuscular disorders  traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries  strokes  non healing wounds  cardiac disorders  renal disorders and cancer 
our outpatient rehabilitation segment consists of clinics and contract services that provide physical  occupational and speech rehabilitation services 
our outpatient rehabilitation patients are typically diagnosed with musculoskeletal impairments that restrict their ability to perform normal activities of daily living 

table of contents significant events refinancing on august   select entered into an additional credit extension amendment to its senior secured credit facility 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the additional credit extension amendment  the lenders extended an aggregate principal amount of million in additional term loans to select at the same interest rate and with the same term as applies to the existing term loan amounts borrowed by select under its senior secured credit facility 
on september   select used the proceeds of the additional term loans other than amounts used for fees and expenses and cash on hand to redeem an aggregate of million principal amount of select outstanding senior subordinated notes due at a redemption price of of the principal amount 
select recognized a loss on early retirement of debt of million for the year ended december  in connection with the redemption of the senior subordinated notes  which included the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call premiums 
stock repurchase program the company board of directors has authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to million through march   unless extended by the board of directors 
on february   the company board of directors increased the authorization to up to million and extended the program through march  stock repurchases under this program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  and at times and in such amounts as the company deems appropriate 
the timing of purchases of stock will be based upon market conditions and other factors 
the company is funding this program with cash on hand or borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company repurchased  shares at a cost of million  which includes transaction costs  during the year ended december  since the inception of the program through december   the company has repurchased  shares at a cost of million  or per share  which includes transaction costs 
special cash dividend on october   our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share  or million  paid on december  to all common stockholders of record including holders of shares of restricted stock on december  cash for the dividend came from cash on hand and borrowings under select senior secured revolving credit facility 
summary financial results year ended december  for the year ended december   our net operating revenues increased to  million compared to  million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our specialty hospital revenues increased million or from the prior year and our outpatient rehabilitation revenues increased million or from the prior year 
we had income from operations for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december  we had net income attributable to holdings for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december  our adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  see the section entitled results of operations for a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda 
the increases in our income from operations and adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  are principally due to increases in the operating performance of our specialty hospital segment 
we were able to increase our specialty hospital income from operations million or and our specialty hospital adjusted ebitda million or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  
table of contents net income attributable to holdings increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in our income from operations described above  increases in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries principally related to our joint venture with the baylor health care system  or the baylor jv  and a reduction of interest expense 
we also incurred a smaller loss on early retirement of debt related to the refinancing transactions completed in compared to the refinancing transactions completed in cash flow from operations provided million of cash for the year ended december  for holdings and million of cash for the year ended december  for select 
the difference between holdings and select in cash flow from operations primarily relates to interest payments on holdings senior floating rate notes 
year ended december  for the year ended december   our net operating revenues increased to  million compared to  million for the year ended december  this increase in net operating revenues resulted principally from a increase in our specialty hospital net operating revenue 
the increase in our specialty hospital revenue is primarily due to the regency hospitals we acquired on september  we had income from operations for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december  we had net income attributable to holdings for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december  our adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  see the section entitled results of operations for a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda 
the increase in income from operations  net income and adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  from the prior year resulted from the addition of the regency hospitals acquired on september  and improved operating performance at our other specialty hospitals 
holdings interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  select interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense for both holdings and select is attributable to a reduction in our average interest rate that resulted from the expiration of interest rate swaps during that carried higher fixed interest rates  and lower interest rates on portions of the debt we refinanced on june  cash flow from operations provided million of cash for the year ended december  for holdings and million of cash for the year ended december  for select 
the difference between holdings and select in cash flow from operations primarily relates to interest payments on holdings senior subordinated notes and senior floating rate notes 
regulatory changes the medicare program reimburses us for services furnished to medicare beneficiaries  which are generally persons age and older  those who are chronically disabled  and those suffering from end stage renal disease 
net operating revenues generated directly from the medicare program represented approximately  and of our consolidated net operating revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the medicare program reimburses our long term acute care hospitals  inpatient rehabilitation facilities and outpatient rehabilitation providers  using different payment methodologies 
those payment methodologies are complex and are described elsewhere in this report under business government regulations 
the following is a summary of some of the more significant healthcare regulatory changes that have affected our financial performance in the periods covered by this report or are likely to affect our financial performance and financial condition in the future 

table of contents medicare reimbursement of ltch services in the last few years  there have been significant regulatory changes affecting long term acute care hospitals that have affected our net operating revenues and  in some cases  caused us to change our operating models and strategies 
we have been subject to regulatory changes that occur through the rulemaking procedures of the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms 
historically  rule updates occurred twice each year 
all medicare payments to our long term acute care hospitals are made in accordance with a prospective payment system specifically applicable to long term acute care hospitals  referred to as ltch pps 
proposed rules specifically related to ltchs are generally published in may  finalized in august and effective on october st of each year  coinciding with the start of the federal fiscal year 
the following is a summary of significant changes to the medicare prospective payment system for long term acute care hospitals which have affected our results of operations  as well as the policies and payment rates for fiscal year that affect our patient discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  fiscal year on august   cms published the policies and payment rates for ltch pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the standard federal rate for fiscal year was  which was a decrease from the fiscal year standard federal rate of  in effect from october  to march  and the fiscal year standard federal rate of  that went into effect on april  this update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year was based on a market basket increase of less a reduction of to account for what cms attributed as an increase in case mix in prior periods that resulted from changes in documentation and coding practices less an additional market basket reduction of as mandated by the ppaca 
the final rule established a fixed loss amount for high cost outlier cases for fiscal year of  which was an increase from the fiscal year fixed loss amount of  in effect from october  to march  and the  that went into effect on april  fiscal year on august   cms published the policies and payment rates for ltch pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the standard federal rate for fiscal year was  which was an increase from the fiscal year standard federal rate of  the update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year included a market basket increase of  less a productivity adjustment of  and less an additional market basket reduction of as mandated by the ppaca 
the final rule established a fixed loss amount for high cost outlier cases for fiscal year of  which was a decrease from the fixed loss amount in the fiscal year of  fiscal year on august   cms published the final rule updating the policies and payment rates for ltch pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
two different standard federal rates apply during fiscal year the standard federal rate for discharges on or after october  and before december  was set at  and the standard federal rate for discharges on or after december  for the remainder of fiscal year is  both of which are an increase from the fiscal year standard federal rate of  the update to the standard federal rate for fiscal year through december  includes a market basket increase of  less a productivity adjustment of  and less an additional reduction of mandated by the ppaca 
the standard federal rate for the period of december  through the remainder of fiscal is further reduced by a portion of the one time budget neutrality adjustment of  as discussed below 
the final rule established a fixed loss amount for high cost outlier cases for fiscal year of  which is a decrease from the fixed loss amount in the fiscal year of  
table of contents in the preamble to the proposed update to the medicare policies and payment rates for fiscal year  cms indicated that within the near future it may recommend revisions to the payment policies addressing patient level and facility level criteria 
cms also indicated that these recommendations may render unnecessary the existing payment reductions for medicare patients admitted from a general acute care hospital in excess of the applicable admission thresholds 
we cannot predict whether cms will adopt additional patient level and facility level criteria in the future or  if adopted  how such criteria would affect the application of the percent rule to our ltchs 
medicare market basket adjustments the ppaca instituted a market basket payment adjustment to ltchs 
in fiscal year  the market basket update will be reduced by 
fiscal years and the market basket update will be reduced by 
finally  in fiscal years  the market basket update will be reduced by 
the ppaca specifically allows these market basket reductions to result in less than a payment update and payment rates that are less than the prior year 
percent rule the percent rule is a downward payment adjustment that applies to medicare patients discharged from ltchs who were admitted from a co located hospital or a non co located hospital and caused the ltch to exceed the applicable percentage thresholds for discharged medicare patients 
the schip extension act  as amended by the arra and the ppaca  has limited the application of the percent rule  as described elsewhere in this report under business government regulations 
cms adopted through regulations an additional one year extension of relief from the full application of medicare admission thresholds 
as a result  full implementation of the medicare admission thresholds will not go into effect until cost reporting periods beginning on or after october   except for certain ltchs with cost reporting periods that begin between july  and september  specifically  those freestanding facilities  grandfathered hihs and grandfathered satellites with cost reporting periods beginning on or after july  and before october  are subject to a modified percent rule for discharges occurring in a three month period between july  and september  after the expiration of the extension  our ltchs will be subject to a downward payment adjustment for any medicare patients who were admitted from a co located or a non co located hospital and that exceed the applicable percentage threshold of all medicare patients discharged from the ltch during the cost reporting period 
one time budget neutrality adjustment the regulations governing ltch pps authorizes cms to make a one time adjustment to the standard federal rate to correct any significant difference between actual payments and estimated payments for the first year of ltch pps 
in the update to the medicare policies and payment rates for fiscal year  cms adopted a one time budget neutrality adjustment that results in a permanent negative adjustment of to the ltch base rate 
cms is implementing the adjustment over a three year period by applying a factor of to the standard federal rate in fiscal years  and  except that the adjustment would not apply to payments for discharges occurring on or after october  through december  short stay outlier policy the schip extension act prevented cms from applying the so called very short stay outlier policy for discharges occurring after july  this policy would result in a payment equivalent to the general acute care hospital rate for cases with a length of stay that is less than the average length of stay plus one standard deviation of a case with the same diagnosis related group under ipps  regardless of the clinical considerations for admission to the ltch or the average length of stay an ltch must satisfy for medicare certification 
the schip extension act as amended by ppaca precluded cms from implementing the 
table of contents very short stay outlier policy before december  the very short stay outlier policy is again applicable to discharges occurring on or after december  and will continue to be applied unless congress or cms takes further action 
moratorium on new ltchs and new ltch beds the schip extension act imposed a moratorium on the establishment and classification of new ltchs  ltch satellite facilities and ltch beds in existing ltchs or satellite facilities subject to certain exceptions 
ppaca extended this moratorium by two years 
the moratorium expired on december  unless congress or cms take further action  new ltchs  ltch satellite facilities and ltch beds may be established and enrolled in the medicare program 
medicare reimbursement of inpatient rehabilitation facility services the following is a summary of significant changes to the medicare prospective payment system for inpatient rehabilitation facilities which have affected our results of operations during the periods presented in this report  as well as the policies and payment rates for fiscal year that affect our patient discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  fiscal year on july   cms published an update to the payment rates for irf pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the standard payment conversion factor for discharges during fiscal year was  which was an increase from the standard payment conversion factor from fiscal year of  the update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year included the market basket reduction of required by ppaca 
cms also increased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year to  from  fiscal year on august   cms published the policies and payment rates for irf pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  and through september  
the standard payment conversion factor for discharges during fiscal year was  which was an increase from the fiscal year standard payment conversion factor of  the update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year included a market basket increase of  less a productivity adjustment of  and less an additional market basket reduction of as mandated by the ppaca 
cms decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year to  from  established in the final rule for fiscal year in a notice published september   cms corrected its calculation of the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year to  fiscal year on july   cms published the policies and payment rates for irf pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the standard payment conversion factor for discharges for fiscal year is  which is an increase from the fiscal year standard payment conversion factor of  the update to the standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year includes a market basket increase of  less a productivity adjustment of  less an additional market basket reduction of as mandated by the ppaca

table of contents medicare reimbursement of outpatient rehabilitation services the medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the medicare physician fee schedule 
the medicare physician fee schedule rates are automatically updated annually based on a formula  called the sustainable growth rate sgr formula  contained in legislation 
the sgr formula has resulted in automatic reductions in rates in every year since  however  for each year through cms or congress has taken action to prevent the sgr formula reductions 
the american taxpayer relief act of froze medicare physician fee schedule rates at levels through december   averting a scheduled cut as a result of the sgr formula that would have taken effect on january  a reduction in the medicare physician fee schedule payment rates will occur on january   unless congress again takes legislative action to prevent the sgr formula reductions from going into effect 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenues from medicare 
therapy caps beginning on january   the balanced budget act of subjected certain outpatient therapy providers reimbursed under the medicare physician fee schedule to annual limits for therapy expenses 
effective january   the annual limit on outpatient therapy services is  for combined physical and speech language pathology services and  for occupational therapy services 
the per beneficiary caps were  for calendar year the annual limits for therapy expenses do not apply to services furnished and billed by outpatient hospital departments 
in addition  the american taxpayer relief act of extends the annual limits on therapy expenses and manual medical review thresholds to services furnished in hospital outpatient department settings through december  the application of annual limits to hospital outpatient department settings will sunset at the end of unless congress extends it into we operated outpatient rehabilitation clinics at december   of which are provider based outpatient rehabilitation clinics operated as departments of the inpatient rehabilitation hospitals we operated 
in the deficit reduction act of  congress implemented an exceptions process to the annual limit for therapy expenses 
under this process  a medicare enrollee or person acting on behalf of the medicare enrollee is able to request an exception from the therapy caps if the provision of therapy services was deemed to be medically necessary 
therapy cap exceptions have been available automatically for certain conditions and on a case by case basis upon submission of documentation of medical necessity 
the american taxpayer relief act of extends the exceptions process for outpatient therapy caps through december  unless congress extends the exceptions process  the therapy caps will apply to all outpatient therapy services beginning january   except those services furnished and billed by outpatient hospital departments 
the middle class tax relief and job creation act of made several changes to the exceptions process to the annual limit for therapy expenses 
for any claim above the annual limit  the claim must contain a modifier indicating that the services are medically necessary and justified by appropriate documentation in the medical record 
effective october   all claims exceeding  are subject to a manual medical review process 
the  threshold is applied separately to the combined physical therapy speech therapy cap and the occupational therapy cap 
the american taxpayer relief act of extends through december  the requirement that medicare perform manual medical review of therapy services when an exception is requested for cases in which the beneficiary has reached a specified dollar aggregate threshold 
effective october   all therapy claims  whether above or below the annual limit  must include the national provider identifier npi of the physician responsible for certifying and periodically reviewing the plan of care 

table of contents multiple procedure payment reduction cms adopted a multiple procedure payment reduction for therapy services in the final update to the medicare physician fee schedule for calendar year this multiple procedure payment reduction policy became effective january  and applies to all outpatient therapy services paid under medicare part b 
furthermore  the multiple procedure payment reduction policy applies across all therapy disciplines occupational therapy  physical therapy and speech language pathology 
under the policy  the medicare program pays of the practice expense component of the therapy procedure or unit of service with the highest relative value unit  and then reduces the payment for the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy procedures or units of service furnished during the same day for the same patient  regardless of whether those therapy services are furnished in separate sessions 
in and the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy service furnished during the same day for the same patient was reduced by in office and other non institutional settings and by in institutional settings 
the american taxpayer relief act of increases the payment reduction to effective april  our outpatient rehabilitation therapy services are primarily offered in institutional settings and  as such  are subject to the applicable payment reduction in the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy services furnished by us to the same patient on the same day until april  when the payment reduction will increase to 
budget control act of the budget control act of  enacted on august   increased the federal debt ceiling in connection with deficit reductions over the next ten years 
the budget control act of requires automatic reductions in federal spending by approximately trillion split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
payments to medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions  subject to a cap 
the american taxpayer relief act of temporarily delays the automatic  across the board sequestration cuts in federal spending imposed by the budget control act of  which are expected to reduce medicare payments by more than billion in fiscal year and billion over the period of fiscal years to unless further legislation is enacted  we believe this will generally result in a reduction to medicare payments for services furnished on or after april   which reduction will have an adverse financial impact on our net operating revenues and profitability 
development of new specialty hospitals and clinics in addition to the growth of our business through the acquisition and integration of other businesses  we have also grown our business through specialty hospital and outpatient rehabilitation facility development opportunities 
since our inception in through december   we have internally developed specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics 
the schip extension act as extended by ppaca instituted a moratorium on the development of new ltchs through december  as a result  we stopped all new ltch development during this period 
now that the moratorium on new ltchs and satellites has expired  we will evaluate the addition of ltch beds at certain of our hospitals 
we will also continue to evaluate opportunities to develop new joint venture relationships with significant health systems and from time to time we may also develop new inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
we also intend to open new outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the local areas that we currently serve where we can benefit from existing referral relationships and brand awareness to produce incremental growth 

table of contents critical accounting matters merger transactions on february   egl acquisition corp 
was merged with and into select  with select continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of holdings 
the merger was completed pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of october   among egl acquisition corp  holdings and select 
we refer to the merger and the related transactions collectively as the merger 
as a result of the merger transactions  the majority of select assets and liabilities were adjusted to their fair value as of february  the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of select tangible and identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill 
additionally  a portion of the equity related to our continuing stockholders was recorded at the stockholder predecessor basis and a corresponding portion of the fair value of the acquired assets was reduced accordingly 
sources of revenue our net operating revenues are derived from a number of sources  including commercial  managed care  private and governmental payors 
our net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable from each of the applicable payors and the federal medicare program 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
net operating revenues generated directly from the medicare program from all segments represented approximately  and of net operating revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately  and of our specialty hospital revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were received for services provided to medicare patients 
most of our specialty hospitals receive bi weekly periodic interim payments from medicare instead of being paid on an individual claim basis 
under a periodic interim payment methodology  medicare estimates a hospital claim volume based on historical trends and makes bi weekly interim payments to us based on these estimates 
twice a year per hospital  medicare reconciles the differences between the actual claim data and the estimated payments 
to the extent our actual hospital experience is different from the historical trends used by medicare to develop the estimate  the periodic interim payment will result in our being either temporarily over paid or under paid for our medicare claims 
at each balance sheet date  we record any aggregate under payment as an account receivable or any aggregate over payment as a payable to third party payors on our balance sheet 
the timing of when we receive our bi weekly periodic interim payments  in relation to our balance sheet date  can have an impact on our accounts receivable balance and our days sales outstanding as of the end of any reporting period 
contractual adjustments net operating revenues include amounts estimated by us to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
contractual allowances are calculated and recorded through our internally developed systems 
in our specialty hospital segment our billing system automatically calculates estimated medicare reimbursement and associated contractual allowances 
for non governmental payors in our specialty hospital segment  we either manually calculate the contractual allowance for each patient based upon the contractual provisions associated with the specific payor or where we have a relatively homogeneous patient population  we monitor individual payors historical closed paid claims data and 
table of contents apply those payment rates to the existing patient population 
the net payments are converted into per diem rates 
the per diem rates are applied to unpaid patient days to determine the expected payment and a contractual adjustment is recorded to adjust the recorded amount to agree with the expected payment 
quarterly  we update our analysis of historical closed paid claims 
in our outpatient segment  we perform provision testing  using internally developed systems  whereby we monitor a payors historical paid claims data and compare it against the associated gross charges 
this difference is determined as a percentage of gross charges and is applied against gross billing revenue to determine the contractual allowances for the period 
additionally  these contractual percentages are applied against the gross receivables on the balance sheet to determine that adequate contractual reserves are maintained for the gross accounts receivables reported on the balance sheet 
we account for any difference as additional contractual adjustments to gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues in the period that the difference is determined 
we believe the processes described above and used in recording our contractual adjustments have resulted in reasonable estimates determined on a consistent basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are related to providing healthcare services to patients 
collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our financial performance 
our primary collection risks relate to non governmental payors who insure these patients  and deductibles  co payments and self insured amounts owed by the patient 
deductibles  co payments and self insured amounts are an immaterial portion of our net accounts receivable balance 
at december   deductibles  co payments and self insured amounts owed by the patient accounted for approximately of our net accounts receivable balance before doubtful accounts 
our general policy is to verify insurance coverage prior to the date of admission for a patient admitted to our hospitals  or in the case of our outpatient rehabilitation clinics  we verify insurance coverage prior to their first therapy visit 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by providing a reserve allowance based upon the age of an account balance 
generally we reserve as uncollectible all governmental accounts over days from discharge and non governmental accounts over days from discharge 
this method is monitored based on our historical cash collections experience 
collections are impacted by the effectiveness of our collection efforts with non governmental payors and regulatory or administrative disruptions with the fiscal intermediaries that pay our governmental receivables 
we estimate bad debts for total accounts receivable within each of our operating units 
we believe our policies have resulted in reasonable estimates determined on a consistent basis 
we have historically collected substantially all of our third party insured receivables net of contractual allowances which include receivables from governmental agencies 
historically  there has not been a material difference between our bad debt allowances and the ultimate historical collection rates on accounts receivable 
we review our overall reserve adequacy by monitoring historical cash collections as a percentage of net revenue less the provision for bad debts 
uncollected accounts are charged against the reserve when they are turned over to an outside collection agency  or when management determines that the balance is uncollectible  whichever occurs first 
the following table is an aging of our net after allowances for contractual adjustments but before doubtful accounts accounts receivable as of the dates indicated in thousands balance as of december  days over days days over days commercial insurance and other medicare and medicaid total net accounts receivable 
table of contents the approximate percentage of total net accounts receivable after allowance for contractual adjustments but before doubtful accounts summarized by aging categories as of the dates indicated is as follows as of december  to days to days to days over days total the approximate percentage of total net accounts receivable after allowance for contractual adjustments but before doubtful accounts summarized by insured status as of the dates indicated is as follows as of december  commercial insurance and other medicare and medicaid self pay receivables including deductibles and co payments total insurance under a number of our insurance programs  which include our employee health insurance program and certain components under our property and casualty insurance program  we are liable for a portion of our losses 
in these cases we accrue for our losses under an occurrence based principle whereby we estimate the losses that will be incurred by us in a given accounting period and accrue that estimated liability 
where we have substantial exposure  we utilize actuarial methods in estimating the losses 
in cases where we have minimal exposure  we will estimate our losses by analyzing historical trends 
we monitor these programs quarterly and revise our estimates as necessary to take into account additional information 
at december  and december   we have recorded a liability of million and million  respectively  for our estimated losses under these insurance programs 
related party transactions we are party to various rental and other agreements with companies affiliated with us through common ownership 
our payments to these related parties amounted to million for both the years ended december  and our future commitments are related to commercial office space we lease for our corporate headquarters in mechanicsburg  pennsylvania 
these future commitments as of december  amount to million through these transactions and commitments are described more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
the company practice is that any such transaction must receive the prior approval of both the audit and compliance committee of the board of directors and a majority of non interested members of the board of directors 
it is the company practice that an independent third party appraisal supporting the amount of rent for such leased space is obtained prior to approving the related party lease of office space 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to periodic impairment evaluations 
our most recent impairment assessment was completed during the fourth quarter of  which indicated that there was no impairment with respect to goodwill or other recorded intangible assets 
the majority of our goodwill resides in our specialty hospital reporting unit 
in performing periodic impairment tests  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment condition exists  which results in an impairment loss equal to the excess carrying value 
impairment tests are required to be conducted at least annually  or when events or conditions occur that might suggest a possible impairment 
these events or conditions include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in the business environment  regulatory environment or legal factors  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of continuing losses  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
the occurrence of one of these events or conditions could significantly impact an impairment assessment  necessitating an impairment charge and adversely affecting our results of operations 
for purposes of goodwill impairment assessment  we have defined our reporting units as specialty hospitals  outpatient rehabilitation clinics and contract therapy  with goodwill having been allocated among reporting units based on the relative fair value of those divisions when the merger occurred in and based on subsequent acquisitions 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
included in the discounted cash flow are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  internal development of specialty hospitals and rehabilitation clinics  future adjusted ebitda margin estimates  future general and administrative expense rates and the weighted average cost of capital for our industry 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of our industry  our recent transactions  and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
if any one of the above assumptions changes or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with any one of the reporting units 
realization of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating loss carry forwards 
we evaluate the realizability of these deferred tax assets by assessing their valuation allowances and by adjusting the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
among the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our projections of future taxable income streams  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the impact of tax planning strategies that could be implemented to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
however  changes in tax codes  statutory tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of tax accruals and assets and could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
at december   we had deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets of approximately million for both holdings and select principally due to depreciation deductions that have been accelerated for tax purposes 
this amount includes approximately million of valuation reserves related primarily to state net operating losses 

table of contents uncertain tax positions we record and review quarterly our uncertain tax positions 
reserves for uncertain tax positions are established for exposure items related to various federal and state tax matters 
income tax reserves are recorded when an exposure is identified and when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained and the amount of the liability can be estimated 
while we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax positions are adequate  the settlement of any such exposures at amounts that differ from current reserves may require us to materially increase or decrease our reserves for uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation we measure the compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services 
our share based compensation arrangements comprise both stock options and restricted share plans 
we value employee stock options using the black scholes option valuation method that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividend yield of our stock  the expected life of the options and the risk free interest rate

we believe that the presentation 
table of contents of adjusted ebitda is important to investors because adjusted ebitda is commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance by investors within the healthcare industry 
adjusted ebitda is used by management to evaluate financial performance and determine resource allocation for each of our operating units 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to  or substitute for  net income  cash flows generated by operations  investing or financing activities  or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

net operating revenues our net operating revenues increased by to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  specialty hospitals 
our specialty hospital net operating revenues increased by to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year december  the growth in net operating revenue for the year ended december  resulted from increases in patient volumes  increases in both medicare and non medicare reimbursement rates and revenues generated from contracted labor services provided to the baylor jv

the increase in our medicare net revenue per patient day was due to increases in our medicare base rate 
the increases in our non medicare net revenue per patient day resulted from increases in our non government payment rates that have occurred through contract renewal and from medicaid bonus payments we received during the three months ended june  outpatient rehabilitation 
our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenues increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the net operating revenues generated by our outpatient rehabilitation clinics for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was principally related to volume growth in our owned outpatient rehabilitation clinics and revenues we generated from contract labor services provided to the baylor jv

we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the expense represented an effective tax rate of 
although our effective tax rate for the year ended december  approximates our statutory tax rate  the rate was affected by two significant items that offset each other in the effective rate 
we experienced an increase in our effective tax rate from a difference between the tax accounting basis and the financial accounting basis associated with a hospital exchange that occurred in early and an increase in our reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the settlement costs associated with the columbus matter 
these increases were offset by a release in reserves for uncertain tax positions associated with the tax basis of an acquisition we consummated in during  additional information was discovered that further supported the tax basis of entities acquired through this acquisition and resulted in a change in the estimates related to this tax uncertainty 
our low effective tax rate for the year ended december  is below the statutory rate due to the reversal of certain valuation allowances that had been provided on losses in previous years 
a substantial portion of this reversal in our valuation allowance relates to our ability to utilize a federal capital loss generated in to offset a taxable capital gain on a recently completed transaction
