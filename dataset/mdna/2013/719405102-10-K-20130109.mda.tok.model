item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended october   october  and october  overview the company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers  and manufacturers of fpds 
photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other higher performance electronic products such as photonics  micro electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications 
thus  the company selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications  particularly as it relates to the semiconductor industry migration to more advanced design methodologies and fabrication processes 
the company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products manufactured using photomask technologies 
consequently  an increase in semiconductor or fpd sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales 
however  the reduced use of customized ics  reductions in design complexity  other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing or designing semiconductors  or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or fpd designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors and fpds increases 
advances in semiconductor  fpd and photomask design and semiconductor and fpd production methods could also reduce the demand for photomasks 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the global semiconductor industry  including mobile display devices  is driven by end markets which have been closely tied to consumer driven applications of high performance semiconductor devices including  but not limited to  mobile communications and computing solutions 
the company is typically required to fulfill its customer orders within a short period of time  sometimes within hours 
this results in the company having a minimal level of backlog orders  typically one to two weeks for ic photomasks and two to three weeks for fpd photomasks 
the company cannot predict the timing of the industry transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy  but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future  beneficially and adversely affecting its business  financial condition and operating results in the near term 
the company believes its ability to remain successful in these environments is dependent upon its achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader and efficient solutions supplier  which it believes should enable it to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure 
the company is focused on improving its competitiveness by advancing its technology and reducing costs and  in connection therewith  has invested in manufacturing equipment to serve the high end market 
the company  in order to lower its operating costs and increase its manufacturing efficiencies  ceased the manufacture of photomasks at its singapore facility in december as the company continues to face challenges in the current and near term that require it to continue to make significant improvements in its competitiveness  it continues to evaluate further cost reduction initiatives 
as of december state of the art production for semiconductor masks is considered to be nanometer and lower for ics and generation and above and amoled display based process technologies for fpds 
however  nanometer and above geometries for semiconductors and generation and below  excluding amoled  process technologies for fpds constitute the majority of designs currently being fabricated in volume 
at these geometries  the company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the company competitors that is not available to the company 
the company expects nanometer designs to continue to move to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal  and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business as a result of its investments in manufacturing processes and technology in the global regions where its customers are located 
the photomask industry has been  and is expected to continue to be  characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to continually anticipate  respond to  and utilize changing technologies 
in particular  the company believes that  as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller  it will be required to manufacture even more complex optically enhanced reticles  including optical proximity correction and phase shift photomasks 
additionally  demand for photomasks has been  and could in the future be  adversely affected by changes in semiconductor and high performance electronics fabrication methods that affect the type or quantity of photomasks used  such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application specific ics 
furthermore  increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks in the production of semiconductors 
as of the end of fiscal  one alternative method  direct write lithography  has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks  as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production  and the company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of this or other alternative semiconductor design methodologies 
however  should direct write or any other alternative method of transferring ic designs to semiconductor wafers without the use of photomasks achieve market acceptance  and the company does not anticipate  respond to  or utilize these or other changing technologies due to resource  technological or other constraints  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities  but generally command higher average selling prices asps 
the company capital expenditure payments aggregated approximately million for the three fiscal years ended october   resulting in significant increases in operating expenses 
the company intends to continue to make the required investments to support the technological demands of its customers and position itself for future growth  and expects capital expenditure payments to be between million and million in fiscal the manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ics and other related products built using comparable photomask based process technologies has been  and continues to be  capital intensive 
the company integrated global manufacturing network  which consists of eight manufacturing sites  and its employees represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base 
should sales volumes decrease as a result of a decrease in design releases from the company customers  the company may have excess or underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins  or result in write offs from asset impairments 
in the second quarter of fiscal the company paid million to micron in connection with its purchase of the us nanofab facility  which it had been leasing from micron under an operating lease that was to end in december the purchase of the facility resulted in the company s outstanding operating lease commitments being reduced by a total of million for fiscal years and in the second quarter of fiscal the company  in connection with its purchase of the us nanofab facility  amended its credit facility the credit facility to include the addition of a million term loan maturing in march with minimum quarterly principal payments of million quarterly payments commenced in june and are based on a ten year repayment period 
the amendment also included a twenty five basis point reduction in the interest rate charged on any borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility bears interest at october   based on the company s total leverage ratio  at libor plus a spread  as defined in the credit facility 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company ceased the manufacture of photomasks at its singapore facility 
this action  which was substantially completed in fiscal  resulted in the company recording restructuring charges of million in fiscal in the board of directors of psmc authorized psmc to repurchase additional shares of its outstanding common stock for retirement 
these repurchase programs resulted in million shares being purchased for million in the fiscal year ended october  psmc s repurchase of these shares increased the company s ownership percentage in psmc from at october  to as of october  subsequent to fiscal year  psmc completed its most recent share repurchase program in november with the repurchase of an additional million shares for million  which increased the company s ownership in psmc to 
in the board of directors of psmc authorized psmc to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock for retirement 
these repurchase programs resulted in million shares being purchased for million 
psmc s repurchase of these shares increased the company s ownership percentage in psmc from at october  to as of october  in the second quarter of fiscal the company issued  through a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended  million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
the notes mature on april   and note holders may convert each  principal amount of notes to shares of common stock equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding april  the conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events  which are described in the indenture dated march  the company is not required to redeem the notes prior to their maturity date 
interest on the notes accrues in arrears  and is paid semiannually through the notes maturity date 
interest payments on the notes commenced on october  the net proceeds of the notes were approximately million  which were used  in part  to repurchase million of the company s convertible senior notes  which were to mature in october  and to pay  in full  its then outstanding obligations under capital leases of million 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal the company  in two separate transactions  acquired million of its convertible senior notes in exchange for million shares of its common stock  with a fair value of million  and cash of million the note holders received shares and cash of for each  note 
the company  in connection with these transactions  recorded extinguishment losses of million  which included the write off of deferred financing fees of million 
the losses are included in other income expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
results of operations the following table presents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended october  october  october  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses consolidation  restructuring and related charges credits operating income interest expense interest and other income expense  net debt extinguishment loss income before income tax provision income tax provision net income net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to photronics  inc shareholders note all the following tabular comparisons  unless otherwise indicated  are for the fiscal years ended october   october  and october   in millions of dollars 
net sales percent change to to ic fpd total net sales net sales for decreased to million as compared to million for  primarily due to reduced photomask demand as a result of a general slowdown in the semiconductor industry  although high end ic unit demand and revenues increased 
revenues attributable to high end products increased by million to million  as high end revenues for ic increased by million to million  which were partially offset by a million reduction in high end fpd revenues to million 
mainstream ic and fpd revenues decreased in as compared to as a result of decreases in both unit demand and average selling prices asps 
high end photomask applications  which typically have higher asps  include photomask sets for ic products using nanometer and below technologies  and for fpd products using generation and above and amoled technologies 
by geographic area  net sales in as compared to decreased by million or in asia  decreased by million or in north america  and decreased by million or in europe 
as a percent of total sales in  sales were in asia  in north america and in europe 
net sales for increased to million as compared to million for the increase was primarily related to increased high end ic and fpd sales  mainly resulting from increased unit demand and asps for both high end ics and fpds 
fpd sales increased primarily as a result of increased unit demand for high end products 
sales of high end ic photomasks increased to million in as compared to million in  and sales of high end fpd photomasks increased to million in as compared to million in by geographic area  net sales in as compared to increased by million or in asia  increased by million or in north america  and increased by million or in europe 
as a percent of total sales in  sales were in asia  in north america and in europe 
gross margin percent change to to gross margin gross margin gross margin percentage decreased to in from in  primarily due to a decrease in sales in as compared to the company operates in a high fixed cost environment and  to the extent that the company revenues and utilization increase or decrease  gross margin will generally be positively or negatively impacted 
gross margin percentage increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to increased sales volume  including high end photomasks which typically have higher asps 
selling  general and administrative expenses percent change to to s  g a expenses of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in  as compared to  and increased by million to million in as compared to these increases were primarily related to increased employee compensation and selling related expenses 
research and development percent change to to r d expense of net sales research and development expenses consist primarily of global development efforts related to high end process technologies for advanced sub wavelength reticle solutions for ic technologies 
research and development expenses increased by million to million in  as compared to  primarily due to increased activities at advanced nanometer technology nodes for ic and fpd photomasks 
research and development expenses did not change significantly in as compared to consolidation  restructuring and related charges credits employee terminations and other asset write downs net gain on sales of assets total consolidation  restructuring and related charges credits singapore facility in the first quarter of fiscal the company ceased the manufacture of photomasks at its singapore facility and  in connection therewith  recorded charges of million during fiscal this restructuring  which was comprised primarily of employee termination costs  was substantially completed in fiscal shanghai  china  facility net restructuring credits of million in primarily relate to the sale of the company s shanghai  china  manufacturing facility 
in the carrying value of this facility was written down to its estimated fair value at that time  and in the facility was sold for net proceeds of million  which exceeded its carrying value and resulted in a gain of million that was recorded as a credit to the restructuring reserve 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy 
this ongoing assessment could result in future facility closures  asset redeployments  workforce reductions  and the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be predicated on market conditions and customer requirements 
other income expense interest expense interest and other income expense  net debt extinguishment loss total other expense  net interest expense increased slightly in  as compared to  primarily as a result of the term loan entered into in the second quarter of interest and other income expense  net increased in as compared to  primarily as a result of increased interest income on the company s higher cash balances in interest expense decreased in  as compared to  primarily as a result of higher interest rate debt being replaced with the convertible senior notes issued by the company in march in addition  in  the company wrote off million of deferred financing fees  that was charged to interest expense  in connection with refinancing its credit facility 
interest and other income expense  net  increased in as compared to primarily due to increased investment earnings on the company s higher cash balances in  lower non cash losses related to changes in the fair value of certain of the company s common stock warrants and increased earnings on its equity method investment  all of which were largely offset by less favorable foreign currency transaction results 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal  the company acquired million aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes by delivering million in cash and million shares of its common stock  with a fair value of million 
in connection with these acquisitions the company recorded total debt extinguishment losses of million  which included the write off of million of deferred financing fees 
a portion of the net proceeds of the company s march   convertible senior notes offering was used to repurchase these notes 
income tax provision income tax provision effective income tax rate the effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate of in fiscal year primarily due to a higher level of earnings being taxed at lower statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions combined with the benefit of various investment credits in the foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate of in fiscal year primarily due to the impact of the non deductible debt extinguishment losses and the impact of a foreign subsidiary tax settlement offset by a higher level of earnings taxed at lower statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions 
further  in korea and in taiwan  various investment tax credits have been earned  which also reduced the company s effective income tax rate in the effective income tax rate differs from the us statutory rate of in primarily due to tax rates being lower than the us rate in other countries where the company s income is taxed 
the company  in  also benefitted from the utilization of various investment tax credits in korea and taiwan 
the company considers all available evidence when evaluating the potential future realization of its deferred tax assets and  when based on the weight of all available evidence  it determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized  reduces its deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
as a result of these evaluations  the valuation allowance was increased decreased by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company also regularly assesses the potential outcomes of ongoing and future examinations and  accordingly  has recorded accruals for such contingencies 
pklt  the company fpd manufacturing facility in taiwan  has been accorded a tax holiday which commenced in and expires in in addition  the company was accorded a tax holiday in china which expired in the availability of these tax holidays did not have a significant impact on the company decision to increase its asian presence  which was in response to fundamental changes that took place in the semiconductor industry that the company serves 
these tax holidays had no dollar or per share effect on the  or fiscal years 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased to million in as compared to million in  primarily as a result of decreased net income at psmc  the company non wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan  and to a lesser extent  due to psmc s share repurchase program discussed below 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased to million in as compared to million in  primarily as a result of increased net income in at psmc 
in and the board of directors of psmc authorized psmc to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock for retirement 
these repurchase programs resulted in million shares being purchased for million in  and million shares being purchased for million in psmc s repurchase of these shares increased the company s ownership percentage in psmc from at october   to as of october   and to at october  see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the company s ownership percentage in its subsidiary in korea was throughout fiscal to fiscal liquidity and capital resources october  october  october  in millions in millions in millions cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities as of october   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million as of october  the company working capital increased million to million at october   as compared to million at october  the increase in working capital was primarily the result of cash generated from operations 
the company may use its cash available on hand for operations  capital expenditures  debt repayments  strategic opportunities  stock repurchases or other corporate uses  any of which may be material 
as of october   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million as of october  the company working capital increased million to million at october   as compared to million at october  the increase in working capital was primarily the result of cash proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible senior notes of which a portion of the proceeds was used to repay higher interest rate debt and increased cash generated from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was the result of less favorable  when adjusted for a significant non cash debt extinguishment loss charge  year over year operating results  which was partially offset by more cash generated through reduced accounts receivable and inventory balances 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase was the effect of improved year over year operating results excluding the effect of the non cash debt portion of the extinguishment loss as a result of increased sales 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  due to improved operating results in fiscal as a result of increased sales 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  due to increased purchases of property  plant and equipment  which were partially offset by a decrease in the amount of the company s year over year investment in the mp mask joint venture 
the investments in the joint venture were primarily the result of capital calls made by the joint venture 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal increased to million  as compared to million in  primarily due to increases in the company s investment in mp mask as a result of capital calls  net proceeds from the sale of the company s former manufacturing facility in shanghai  china  which reduced total net proceeds used in investing activities in fiscal  and increased capital expenditures in capital expenditures for the   and fiscal years were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditure payments for fiscal to range between million and million  primarily related to investment in high end ic manufacturing capability 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million provided by financing activities in fiscal and  in  was primarily comprised of the proceeds of a million term loan  that was entered into by the company in connection with its purchase of the us nanofab facility  which was partially offset by payments for the repurchase common stock of psmc from noncontrolling interests and repayments on long term borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million used in financing activities in fiscal  and was primarily comprised of the net proceeds received from the march issuance of convertible senior notes  partially offset by the repayment of certain other higher interest rate long term borrowings 
in march the company issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
the company realized net proceeds of million from the issuance of the notes  which mature on april   and commenced paying interest semiannually on october  during the three month period ended may   the company used million of the net proceeds of the convertible senior notes and issued common stock to repurchase approximately million principal amount of its convertible senior notes  and used an additional million of the net proceeds to repay its outstanding obligations under capital leases 
in june the company acquired an additional million principal amount of its outstanding convertible senior notes for million and common stock 
the company may use a portion of the remaining net proceeds of its convertible senior notes to repurchase additional amounts of its outstanding senior convertible notes and for capital expenditure and working capital purposes 
in march the company and its lenders amended its revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the amended credit facility  the total amount available to the company to borrow was reduced from million to million 
the credit facility bears interest at october   based on the company s total leverage ratio  at libor plus a spread  as defined in the agreement 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets located in the united states  as well as common stock the company owns in certain of its foreign subsidiaries  and is subject to financial covenants  including the following  as defined in the agreement minimum fixed charge ratio  total leverage ratio and minimum unrestricted cash balance 
in january a million irrevocable stand by letter of credit  which expired in july  for the purchase of manufacturing equipment was issued under the credit facility 
as of october   the company was in compliance with the covenants of its credit facility  had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and million was available for borrowing 
in april the company entered into a year  million capital lease of manufacturing equipment 
payments under the lease  which bears interest at  are million per month through march as of october   the total lease amount payable through the end of the lease term was million  of which million represented principal and million represented interest 
in february the company paid million to micron in connection with the purchase of the us nanofab facility 
in connection therewith  the company amended its credit facility to include the addition of a million term loan maturing in march  with minimum quarterly principal payments of million and an outstanding balance of million at october  the amendment also included a twenty five basis point reduction in the interest rate charged on any borrowings under the credit facility 
as a result of the purchase of the us nanofab facility  the company s lease agreement with micron for the us nanofab facility was cancelled  which reduced the company s related outstanding operating lease commitments by a combined total of million for fiscal years and in and the board of directors of psmc authorized psmc to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock for retirement 
these repurchase programs resulted in million shares being repurchased for million in and million shares being purchased for million in the company liquidity is highly dependent on its sales volume  cash conversion cycle  and the timing of its capital expenditures which can vary significantly from period to period  as it operates in a high fixed cost environment 
depending on conditions in the semiconductor and fpd markets  the company cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash may not be adequate to meet its current and long term needs for capital expenditures  operations and debt repayments 
historically  in certain years  the company has used external financing to fund these needs 
due to conditions in the credit markets  some financing instruments used by the company in the past may not be currently available to it 
the company continues to evaluate further cost reduction initiatives 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to it on commercially favorable terms  should its cash requirements exceed cash available from operations  existing cash  and cash available under its credit facility 
at october   the company had outstanding purchase commitments of million  which included million related to capital expenditures  primarily for investment in high end ic photomask manufacturing capability 
the company intends to finance its capital expenditures with its working capital  cash generated from operations  and  if necessary  with additional borrowings 
cash requirements the company cash requirements in fiscal will be primarily to fund its operations  including capital spending  and to service its debt 
the company believes that its cash on hand  cash generated from operations and amounts available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months 
the company regularly reviews the availability and terms on which it might issue additional equity or debt securities in the public or private markets 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms  should the company cash requirements exceed its cash available from operations  existing cash  and cash available under its credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table presents the company contractual obligations as of october  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term borrowings operating leases capital leases unconditional purchase obligations interest other noncurrent liabilities total as of october   the company had an outstanding balance of million for a loan from a customer which was not included in the above table 
the proceeds of the loan were used to purchase manufacturing equipment 
this loan is expected to be repaid with product supplied to the customer  typically on a monthly basis  and the company estimates that the loan will be fully repaid in fiscal as of october   the company had recorded accruals for uncertain tax positions of million which was not included in the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments related to such liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements under the mp mask joint venture operating agreement  in order to maintain its ownership interest  the company may be required to make additional capital contributions to the joint venture up to the maximum amount defined in the operating agreement 
cumulatively  through october   the company has contributed million to the joint venture  and has received distributions from the joint venture totaling million 
during fiscal  the company contributed million to mp mask 
the company received no distributions from mp mask during fiscal the company leases certain office facilities and equipment under operating leases that may require it to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses related to the properties 
certain of these leases contain renewal or purchase options exercisable at the end of the lease terms 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these operating leases 
business outlook a majority of the company revenue growth is expected to continue to come from the asian region as customers increase their use of manufacturing foundries located outside of north america and europe 
additional revenue growth is also anticipated in north america  as the company expects to benefit from advanced technology it may utilize under its technology license with micron 
the company korean and taiwanese operations are non wholly owned subsidiaries and  therefore  a portion of earnings generated at each location is allocated to the noncontrolling interests 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy and monitor its market capitalization  sales volume and related cash flows from operations 
this ongoing assessment could result in future facility closures  asset redeployments  additional impairments of intangible or long lived assets  workforce reductions  or the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be based on market conditions and customer requirements 
the company future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained in this filing involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
while various risks and uncertainties have been discussed  a number of other unforeseen factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company expectations 
critical accounting estimates the company consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time they are made 
changes in accounting estimates used are likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the company financial condition and results of operations 
actual results reported by the company may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews these estimates periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period in which they are determined 
fair value of financial instruments the fair values of the company and convertible senior notes are estimated by management based upon reference to quoted market prices and other available market information 
the fair values of the company cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  certain other current assets and current liabilities  and variable rate borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their short term maturities 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment  except as explained below under impairment of long lived assets  are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
repairs and maintenance  as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature  are charged to operations as incurred  while those that improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized 
upon sale or other disposition  the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  machinery and equipment over to years and furniture  fixtures and office equipment over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is less 
judgment and assumptions are used in establishing estimated useful lives and depreciation periods 
the company also uses judgment and assumptions as it periodically reviews property  plant and equipment for any potential impairment in carrying values whenever events such as a significant industry downturn  plant closures  technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of a technology license agreement  a supply agreement and acquisition related intangibles 
these assets  except as explained below  are stated at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization 
amortization is calculated based on the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years  using the straight line method or another method that more fairly represents the utilization of the assets 
the company periodically evaluates the remaining useful lives of its intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
in the event that the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life has changed  the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
if it is determined that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life  that intangible asset would be subject to impairment testing annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not  based on future undiscounted cash flows or market factors  be recoverable  and an impairment loss would be recorded in the period so determined 
the measurement of the impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the intangible asset 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the assets 
the carrying values of assets determined to be impaired are reduced to their estimated fair values 
fair values of the impaired assets would generally be determined using a market or income approach 
investments in joint ventures investments in joint ventures over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence and that  in general  are at least percent owned are accounted for under the equity method 
an impairment loss would be recognized whenever a decrease in the value of such an investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in judging other than temporary  the company would consider the length of time and the extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investment  the near term and longer term operating and financial prospects of the investee  and the company longer term intent of retaining its investment in the investee 
variable interest entities the company accounts for the investments it makes in certain legal entities in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or  as a group  the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have either the power  through voting or similar rights  to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance or  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the legal entity 
these certain legal entities are referred to as variable interest entities  or vies 
the company would consolidate the results of any such entity in which it determined that it had a controlling financial interest 
the company would have a controlling financial interest in such an entity if the company had both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses of  or right to receive benefits from  the vie that could be potentially significant to the vie 
on a quarterly basis  the company reassesses whether it has a controlling financial interest in any investments it has in these certain legal entities 
income taxes the income tax provision is computed on the basis of the various tax jurisdictions income or loss before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes  as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
the company uses judgment and assumptions to determine if valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets are required  if their realization is not more likely than not  by considering future market growth  forecasted operations  future taxable income  and the amounts of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company considers income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its effective income tax rate 
current income tax exposure is identified and temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and financial reporting purposes are assessed 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  the company evaluates the potential realization of deferred income tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if their realization is deemed not more likely than not 
accordingly  income taxes charged against earnings may have been impacted by changes in the valuation allowances 
significant management estimates and judgment are required in determining any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recording a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in its tax returns 
the company includes any applicable interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in its income tax provision 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is determined by the shipping terms of the individual sales transactions 
for sales with fob destination shipping terms  delivery occurs when the company s product reaches its destination and is received by the customer 
for sales with fob shipping point terms  delivery occurs when the company s product is received by the common carrier 
the company uses judgment when estimating the effect on revenue of discounts and product warranty obligations  both of which are accrued when the related revenue is recognized 
warranties and other post shipment obligations for a day period  the company warrants that items sold will conform to customer specifications 
however  the company s liability is limited to the repair or replacement of the photomasks at its sole option 
the company inspects photomasks for conformity to customer specifications prior to shipment 
accordingly  customer returns of items under warranty have historically been insignificant
