item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the historical investment performance of our funds 
our reported net asset values  rates of return and incentive income from affiliates are based in large part upon estimates of the fair value of our investments  which are based on subjective standards and may prove to be incorrect 
a large number of investments in our funds are illiquid and thus have no readily ascertainable market prices 
we value these investments based on our estimate of their fair value as of the date of determination 
we estimate the fair value of our investments based on third party models  or models developed by us  which include discounted cash flow analyses and other techniques and may be based  at least in part  on independently sourced market parameters 
the material estimates and assumptions used in these models include the timing and expected amount of cash flows  the appropriateness of discount rates used  and  in some cases  the ability to execute  the timing of and the estimated proceeds from expected financings 
the actual results related to any particular investment often vary materially as a result of the inaccuracy of these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  because many of the illiquid investments held by our funds are in industries or sectors which are unstable  in distress  or undergoing some uncertainty  such investments are subject to rapid changes in value caused by sudden company specific or industry wide developments 
we include the fair value of illiquid assets in the calculations of net asset values  returns of our funds and our aum 
furthermore  we recognize incentive income from affiliates based in part on these estimated fair values 
because these valuations are inherently uncertain  they may fluctuate greatly from period to period 
also  they may vary greatly from the prices that would be obtained if the assets were to be liquidated on the date of the valuation and often do vary greatly from the prices we eventually realize 
in addition  the values of our investments in publicly traded assets are subject to significant volatility  including due to a number of factors beyond our control 
these include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of these companies or other companies in their industries  market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale  general economic  social or political developments  changes in industry conditions or government regulations  changes in management or capital structure and significant acquisitions and dispositions 
because the market prices of these securities can be volatile  the valuation of these assets will change from period to period  and the valuation for any particular period may not be realized at the time of disposition 
in addition  because our private equity funds often hold very large amounts of the securities of their portfolio companies  the disposition of these securities often takes place over a long period of time  which can further expose us to volatility risk 
even if we hold a quantity of public securities that may be difficult to sell in a single transaction  we do not discount the market price of the security for purposes of our valuations 
if we realize value on an investment that is significantly lower than the value at which it was reflected in a fund s net asset values  we would suffer losses in the applicable fund 
this could in turn lead to a decline in asset management fees and a loss equal to the portion of the incentive income from affiliates reported in prior periods that was not realized upon disposition 
these effects could become applicable to a large number of our investments if our estimates and assumptions used in estimating their fair values differ from future valuations due to market developments 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations segment analysis for information related to fund activity that is no longer consolidated 
if asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in fund net asset values  fund investors could lose confidence which could  in turn  result in redemptions from our funds that permit redemptions or difficulties in raising additional investments 
we have experienced rapid growth  which may be difficult to sustain and which may place significant demands on our administrative  operational and financial resources 

table of contents our aum has grown significantly in the past and we are pursuing further growth in the near future 
our rapid growth has caused  and planned growth  if successful  will continue to cause  significant demands on our legal  accounting and operational infrastructure  and increased expenses 
the complexity of these demands  and the expense required to address them  is a function not simply of the amount by which our aum has grown  but of the growth in the variety  including the differences in strategy between  and complexity of  our different funds 
in addition  we are required to continuously develop our systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the investment management market and legal  accounting  regulatory and tax developments 
our future growth will depend in part  on our ability to maintain an operating platform and management system sufficient to address our growth and will require us to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources 
as a result  we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial  regulatory and business controls  implementing new or updated information and financial systems and procedures  and in training  managing and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our businesses on a timely and cost effective basis 
we may not be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or be able to continue to grow  and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses 
extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties 
the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our businesses 
changes in tax or law and other legislative or regulatory changes could adversely affect us 
overview of our regulatory environment 
we are subject to extensive regulation  including periodic examinations  by governmental and self regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world 
many of these regulators  including us and foreign government agencies and self regulatory organizations  as well as state securities commissions in the united states  are empowered to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines  suspensions of personnel or other sanctions  including censure  the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of an investment advisor from registration or memberships 
even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount  the adverse publicity relating to the investigation  proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing investors or fail to gain new investors 
the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in our funds and are not designed to protect our shareholders 
consequently  these regulations often serve to limit our activities 
as a result of highly publicized financial scandals  investors have exhibited concerns over the integrity of the us financial markets and the regulatory environment in which we operate both in the united states and outside the united states is particularly likely to be subject to further regulation 
there has been an active debate both nationally and internationally over the appropriate extent of regulation and oversight of private investment funds and their managers 
any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our businesses may impose additional expenses on us  require the attention of senior management or result in limitations in the manner in which our business is conducted 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the dodd frank act  which imposes significant new regulations on almost every aspect of the us financial services industry  including aspects of our business and the markets in which we operate 
among other things  the dodd frank act requires private equity and hedge fund advisers to register with the sec  under the investment advisers act  to maintain extensive records and to file reports if deemed necessary for purposes of systemic risk assessment by certain governmental bodies 
importantly  many of the provisions of the dodd 
table of contents frank act are subject to further rulemaking and to the discretion of regulatory bodies  such as the financial stability oversight council 
as a result  we do not know exactly what the final regulations under the dodd frank act will require or how significantly the dodd frank act will affect us 
exemptions from certain laws 
we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the securities act  the exchange act  the investment company act  the commodity futures trading commission  the commodity exchange act of  as amended  and the employment retirement income security act of  as amended  in conducting our activities 
these exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control 
if for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us  we could become subject to regulatory action or third party claims and our businesses could be materially and adversely affected 
see  for example  risks related to our organization and structure if we were deemed an investment company under the investment company act  applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and the price of our class a shares 
fund regulatory environment 
the regulatory environment in which our funds operate may affect our businesses 
for example  changes in antitrust laws or the enforcement of antitrust laws could affect the level of mergers and acquisitions activity  and changes in state laws may limit investment activities of state pension plans 
see item business regulatory and compliance matters for a further discussion of the regulatory environment in which we conduct our businesses 
future regulation 
we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec  other us or non us governmental regulatory authorities or self regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets 
as calls for additional regulation have increased  there may be a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative asset management funds  including our funds 
such investigations may impose additional expenses on us  may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines if any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations 
we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self regulatory organizations 
new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business 
apollo provides investment management services through registered investment advisors 
investment advisors are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and in the other countries in which our investment activities occur 
the sec oversees our activities as a registered investment advisor under the investment advisers act 
in the united kingdom  we are subject to regulation by the uk financial services authority  which will be replaced by the financial conduct authority as of april  our other european operations  and our investment activities around the globe  are subject to a variety of regulatory regimes that vary country by country 
a failure to comply with the obligations imposed by regulatory regimes to which we are subject  including the investment advisers act could result in investigations  sanctions and reputational damage 
in june  the sec adopted a new pay to play rule that restricts politically active investment advisors from managing state pension funds 
the rule prohibits  among other things  a covered investment advisor from receiving compensation for advisory services provided to a government entity such as a state pension fund for a two year period after the advisor  certain covered employees of the advisor or any covered political action committee controlled by the advisor or its employees makes a political contribution to certain government officials 
in addition  a covered investment advisor is prohibited from engaging in political fundraising activities for certain elected officials or candidates in jurisdictions where such advisor is providing or seeking governmental business 
this new rule complicates and increases the compliance burden for our investment advisors 
it will be imperative for a covered investment advisor to adopt an effective compliance program in light of the substantial penalties associated with the rule 
in november  the european parliament adopted the directive on alternative investment fund managers  or the aifm  which is required to be implemented in the national laws of the european 
table of contents union eu member states by july  the aifm imposes significant new regulatory requirements on investment managers operating within the eu  including with respect to conduct of business  regulatory capital  valuations  disclosures and marketing 
alternative investment funds organized outside of the eu in which interests are marketed within the eu would be subject to significant conditions on their operations  including  restrictions on marketing interests in relevant funds to eu and european economic area investors  satisfying the competent authority of the robustness of internal arrangements with respect to risk management  in particular liquidity risks and additional operational and counterparty risks associated with short selling  the management and disclosure of conflicts of interest  the fair valuation of assets  and the security of depository custodial arrangements 
additional requirements and restrictions apply where such funds invest in an eu portfolio company  including restrictions that may impose limits on certain investment and realization strategies  such as dividend recapitalizations and reorganizations 
such rules could potentially impose significant additional costs on the operation of our business in the eu and could limit our operating flexibility within the relevant jurisdictions 
in denmark and germany  legislative amendments have been adopted which may limit deductibility of interest and other financing expenses in companies in which our funds have invested or may invest in the future 
in brief  the danish legislative amendments generally entail that annual net financing expenses in excess of a certain threshold amount approximately million in will be limited on the basis of earnings before interest and taxes and or asset tax values 
according to the german interest barrier rule  the tax deduction available to a company in respect of a net interest expense interest expense less interest income is limited to of its tax earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
interest expense that does not exceed the threshold of m can be deducted without any limitations for income tax purposes 
interest expense in excess of the interest deduction limitation may be carried forward indefinitely subject to change in ownership restrictions and used in future periods against all profits and gains 
in respect of a tax group  interest paid by the german tax group entities to non tax group parties eg interest on bank debt  capex facility and working capital facility debt will be restricted to of the tax group s tax ebitda 
however  the interest barrier rule may not apply where german company s gearing under international financial reporting standards ifrs accounting principles is at maximum of higher than the overall group s leverage ratio at the level of the very top level entity which would be subject to ifrs consolidation the escape clause test 
this test is failed where any worldwide company of the entire group pays more than of its net interest expense on debt to substantial ie greater than shareholders  related parties of such shareholders that are not members of the group or secured third parties although security granted by group members should not be harmful 
if the group does not apply ifrs accounting principles  eu member countries generally accepted accounting principles or generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap may also be accepted for the purpose of the escape clause test 
it should be noted that for trade tax purposes  there is principally a add back on all deductible interest paid or accrued by any german entity after the consideration of a tax exempt amount keur which is applied to the sum of all add back amounts 
for trade tax purposes interest payments within a german tax group will not be considered 
our businesses are subject to the risk that similar measures might be introduced in other countries in which they currently have investments or plan to invest in the future  or that other legislative or regulatory measures might be promulgated in any of the countries in which we operate that adversely affect our businesses 
in particular  the us federal income tax law that determines the tax consequences of an investment in class a shares is under review and is potentially subject to adverse legislative  judicial or administrative change  possibly on a retroactive basis  including possible changes that would result in the treatment of a portion of our carried interest income as ordinary income  that would cause us to become taxable as a corporation and or would have other adverse effects 
see risks related to our organization and structure although not enacted  the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a ten year transition period  precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable corporations  and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates 
if similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us  the value of the class a shares could be adversely affected 
in addition  us and foreign labor unions have recently been agitating for greater legislative and regulatory oversight of private equity firms and transactions 
labor unions have also threatened to use their influence to prevent pension funds from investing in private equity funds 

table of contents insurance regulation 
state insurance departments have broad administrative powers over the insurance business of our insurance company affiliates  including insurance company licensing and examination  agent licensing  establishment of reserve requirements and solvency standards  premium rate regulation  admissibility of assets  policy form approval  unfair trade and claims practices and other matters 
state regulators regularly review and update these and other requirements 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic continues to move forward with its implementation of principles based reserving for life insurers  which may change the methodology used by our insurance company affiliates to calculate their reserves 
currently  there are proposals to increase the scope of regulation of insurance holding companies in both the united states and internationally 
in the united states  the naic has promulgated a model law for consideration by the various states that would provide for more extensive informational reporting by parents and affiliates of insurance companies 
internationally  the international association of insurance supervisors is in the process of adopting a framework for the group wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups 
changes to existing laws or regulations must be adopted by individual states or foreign jurisdictions before they will become effective 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty the additional capital requirements  compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on us and our insurance company affiliates 
the dodd frank act created the federal insurance office the fio within the department of treasury headed by a director appointed by the treasury secretary 
the fio is designed principally to exercise a monitoring and information gathering role  rather than a regulatory role 
in that capacity  the fio has been charged with providing reports to the us congress on i modernization of us insurance regulation and ii the us and global reinsurance market 
neither report has been issued to date 
such reports could lead to changes in the regulation of insurers and reinsurers in the us additionally  certain state regulations impose restrictions and limitations on the ability of our insurance company affiliates to pay dividends and make other distributions to their parent companies 
to the extent we depend on dividends from our insurance company affiliates  these regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our revenue  net income and cash flow are all highly variable  which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our class a shares to decline 
our revenue  net income and cash flow are all highly variable  primarily due to the fact that carried interest from our private equity funds and certain of our credit and real estate funds  which constitutes the largest portion of income from our combined businesses  and the transaction and advisory fees that we receive can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in addition  the investment returns of most of our funds are volatile 
we may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of other factors  including changes in the values of our funds investments  changes in the amount of distributions  dividends or interest paid in respect of investments  changes in our operating expenses  the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions 
in addition  carried interest income from our private equity funds and certain of our credit and real estate funds is subject to contingent repayment by the general partner if  upon the final distribution  the relevant fund s general partner has received cumulative carried interest on individual portfolio investments in excess of the amount of carried interest it would be entitled to from the profits calculated for all portfolio investments in the aggregate 
such variability may lead to volatility in the trading price of our class a shares and cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in a future period 
it may be difficult for us to achieve steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis  which could in turn lead to large adverse movements in the price of our class a shares or increased volatility in our class a share price generally 
the timing of carried interest generated by our funds is uncertain and will contribute to the volatility of our results 
carried interest depends on our funds performance 
it takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities  to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value or other proceeds of an investment through a sale  public offering  recapitalization or other exit 
even if an investment proves to be profitable  it may be several years before 
table of contents any profits can be realized in cash or other proceeds 
we cannot predict when  or if  any realization of investments will occur 
generally  with respect to our private equity funds  although we recognize carried interest income on an accrual basis  we receive private equity carried interest payments only upon disposition of an investment by the relevant fund  which contributes to the volatility of our cash flow 
if we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter or year  it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter or year that may not be replicated in subsequent periods 
we recognize revenue on investments in our funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such funds  and a decline in realized or unrealized gains  or an increase in realized or unrealized losses  would adversely affect our revenue  which could further increase the volatility of our results 
with respect to a number of our credit funds  our incentive income is generally paid annually  semi annually or quarterly  and the varying frequency of these payments will contribute to the volatility of our revenues and cash flow 
furthermore  we earn this incentive income only if the net asset value of a fund has increased or  in the case of certain funds  increased beyond a particular threshold 
certain of our credit funds also have high water marks with respect to the investors in these funds 
if the high water mark for a particular investor is not surpassed  we would not earn incentive income with respect to such investor during a particular period even though such investor had positive returns in such period as a result of losses in prior periods 
if such an investor experiences losses  we will not be able to earn incentive income from such investor until it surpasses the previous high water mark 
the incentive income we earn is therefore dependent on the net asset value of investors investments in the fund  which could lead to significant volatility in our results 
because our revenue  net income and cash flow can be highly variable from quarter to quarter and year to year  we plan not to provide any guidance regarding our expected quarterly and annual operating results 
the lack of guidance may affect the expectations of public market analysts and could cause increased volatility in our class a share price 
the investment management business is intensely competitive  which could materially adversely impact us 
the investment management business is intensely competitive 
we face competition both in the pursuit of outside investors for our funds and in acquiring investments in attractive portfolio companies and making other investments 
it is possible that it will become increasingly difficult for our funds to raise capital as funds compete for investments from a limited number of qualified investors 
due to the global economic downturn and generally poor returns in alternative asset investment businesses during the crisis  institutional investors have suffered from decreasing returns  liquidity pressure  increased volatility and difficulty maintaining targeted asset allocations  and a significant number of investors have materially decreased or temporarily stopped making new fund investments during this period 
as the economy begins to recover  such investors may elect to reduce their overall portfolio allocations to alternative investments such as private equity and hedge funds  resulting in a smaller overall pool of available capital in our industry 
even if such investors continue to invest at historic levels  they may seek to negotiate reduced fee structures or other modifications to fund structures as a condition to investing 
in the event all or part of this analysis proves true  when trying to raise new capital we will be competing for fewer total available assets in an increasingly competitive environment which could lead to fee reductions and redemptions as well as difficulty in raising new capital 
such changes would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
competition among funds is based on a variety of factors  including investment performance  investor liquidity and willingness to invest  investor perception of investment managers drive  focus and alignment of interest  quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors  
table of contents business reputation  and the level of fees and expenses charged for services 
we compete in all aspects of our businesses with a large number of investment management firms  private equity  credit and real estate fund sponsors and other financial institutions 
a number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks fund investors may develop concerns that we will allow a business to grow to the detriment of its performance  investors may reduce their investments in our funds or not make additional investments in our funds based upon current market conditions  their available capital or their perception of the health of our businesses  some of our competitors have greater capital  lower targeted returns or greater sector or investment strategy specific expertise than we do  which creates competitive disadvantages with respect to investment opportunities  some of our competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us  which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities  some of our competitors may perceive risk differently than we do  which could allow them either to outbid us for investments in particular sectors or  generally  to consider a wider variety of investments  some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors funds or other available investment products  our competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment  which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment  some fund investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded  there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new private equity and capital markets fund management firms  and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various businesses  including former star portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions themselves  will continue to result in increased competition  there are no barriers to entry to our businesses  implementing an integrated platform similar to ours or the strategies that we deploy at our funds  such as distressed investing  which we believe are our competitive strengths  except that our competitors would need to hire professionals with the investment expertise or grow it internally  and other industry participants continuously seek to recruit our investment professionals away from us 
these and other factors could reduce our earnings and revenues and materially adversely affect our businesses 
in addition  if we are forced to compete with other alternative investment managers on the basis of price  we may not be able to maintain our current management fee and incentive income structures 
we have historically competed primarily on the performance of our funds  and not on the level of our fees or incentive income relative to those of our competitors 
however  there is a risk that fees and incentive 
table of contents income in the alternative investment management industry will decline  without regard to the historical performance of a manager 
fee or incentive income reductions on existing or future funds  without corresponding decreases in our cost structure  would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our ability to retain our investment professionals is critical to our success and our ability to grow depends on our ability to attract additional key personnel 
our success depends on our ability to retain our investment professionals and recruit additional qualified personnel 
we anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add investment professionals as we pursue our growth strategy 
however  we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or retaining current personnel  as the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive 
our investment professionals possess substantial experience and expertise in investing  are responsible for locating and executing our funds investments  have significant relationships with the institutions that are the source of many of our funds investment opportunities  and in certain cases have key relationships with our fund investors 
therefore  if our investment professionals join competitors or form competing companies it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities and certain existing fund investors 
legislation has been proposed in the us congress to treat portions of carried interest as ordinary income rather than as capital gain for us federal income tax purposes 
because we compensate our investment professionals in large part by giving them an equity interest in our business or a right to receive carried interest  such legislation could adversely affect our ability to recruit  retain and motivate our current and future investment professionals 
see risks related to taxation our structure involves complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available 
our structure is also subject to potential legislative  judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations  possibly on a retroactive basis 
the loss of even a small number of our investment professionals could jeopardize the performance of our funds  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
efforts to retain or attract investment professionals may result in significant additional expenses  which could adversely affect our profitability 
we may not be successful in expanding into new investment strategies  markets and businesses 
we actively consider the opportunistic expansion of our businesses  both geographically and into complementary new investment strategies 
we may not be successful in any such attempted expansion 
attempts to expand our businesses involve a number of special risks  including some or all of the following the diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  the disruption of our ongoing businesses  entry into markets or businesses in which we may have limited or no experience  increasing demands on our operational systems  potential increase in investor concentration  and the broadening of our geographic footprint  increasing the risks associated with conducting operations in foreign jurisdictions 
additionally  any expansion of our businesses could result in significant increases in our outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements  which would increase the risks in investing in our class a shares and may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we also may not be successful in identifying new investment strategies or geographic markets that increase our profitability  or in identifying and acquiring new businesses that increase our profitability 
because we have not yet identified these potential new investment strategies  geographic markets or businesses  we cannot identify for you all the risks we may face and the potential adverse consequences on us and your investment that may result from our attempted expansion 
we also do not know how long it may take for us to expand  if we do so at all 
we have total discretion  at the direction of our manager  
table of contents without needing to seek approval from our board of directors or shareholders  to enter into new investment strategies  geographic markets and businesses  other than expansions involving transactions with affiliates which may require board approval 
many of our funds invest in relatively high risk  illiquid assets and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of the principal amount we invest in these activities 
many of our funds invest in securities that are not publicly traded 
in many cases  our funds may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time 
our funds will generally not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under applicable securities laws  or unless an exemption from such registration requirements is available 
accordingly  our funds may be forced  under certain conditions  to sell securities at a loss 
the ability of many of our funds  particularly our private equity funds  to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets  inasmuch as the ability to realize value from an investment may depend upon the ability to complete an ipo of the portfolio company in which such investment is held 
furthermore  large holdings even of publicly traded equity securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial period of time  exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the disposition period 
dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments 
because certain of our funds investments rely heavily on the use of leverage  our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our continued ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates 
for example  in many of our private equity investments  indebtedness may constitute or more of a portfolio company s total debt and equity capitalization  including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment  and a portfolio company s leverage may increase as a result of recapitalization transactions subsequent to the company s acquisition by a private equity fund 
the absence of available sources of senior debt financing for extended periods of time could therefore materially and adversely affect our private equity funds 
an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those investments 
increases in interest rates could also make it more difficult to locate and consummate private equity investments because other potential buyers  including operating companies acting as strategic buyers  may be able to bid for an asset at a higher price due to a lower overall cost of capital 
in addition  a portion of the indebtedness used to finance private equity investments often includes high yield debt securities issued in credit funds 
availability of capital from the high yield debt markets is subject to significant volatility  and there may be times when we might not be able to access those markets at attractive rates  or at all 
for example  the dislocation in the credit markets which we believe began in july and the record backlog of supply in the debt markets resulting from such dislocation materially affected the ability and willingness of banks to underwrite new high yield debt securities until relatively recently 
investments in highly leveraged entities are inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues  increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic  market and industry developments 
the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could  among other things give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow  which might limit the entity s ability to respond to changing industry conditions to the extent additional cash is needed for the response  to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities  allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render it unable to service its indebtedness  leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of the equity investment in it  
table of contents limit the entity s ability to adjust to changing market conditions  thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have relatively less debt  limit the entity s ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth  and limit the entity s ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing  including for capital expenditures  working capital or general corporate purposes 
as a result  the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt 
for example  many investments consummated by private equity sponsors during the past three years which utilized significant amounts of leverage are experiencing severe economic stress and may default on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenues and cash flow precipitated by the recent economic downturn 
when our private equity funds existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced  those investments may materially suffer if they have generated insufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if the current unusually limited availability of financing for such purposes were to persist for several years  when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance our private equity funds existing portfolio investments start to come due  these funds could be materially and adversely affected 
our credit funds may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs and regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital 
the use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment portfolio 
the fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities 
the interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried  and will be lost and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated in the event of a decline in the market value of such securities 
gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund s net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings 
however  if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings  the fund s net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings 
in addition  as a business development company under the investment company act  ainv is permitted to issue senior securities in amounts such that its asset coverage ratio equals at least after each issuance of senior securities 
ainv s ability to pay dividends will be restricted if its asset coverage ratio falls below at least and any amounts that it uses to service its indebtedness are not available for dividends to its common stockholders 
an increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of fixed rate debt investments that our funds make 
any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
the potential requirement to convert our financial statements from being prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to international financial reporting standards may strain our resources and increase our annual expenses 
as a public entity  the sec may require in the future that we report our financial results under international financial reporting standards  or ifrs  instead of under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or us gaap 
ifrs is a set of accounting principles that has been gaining acceptance on a worldwide basis 
these standards are published by the london based international accounting standards board  or iasb  and are more focused on objectives and principles and less reliant on detailed rules than us gaap 
today  there remain significant and material differences in several key areas between us gaap and ifrs which would affect apollo 
additionally  us gaap provides specific guidance in classes of accounting transactions for which equivalent guidance in ifrs does not exist 
the adoption of ifrs is highly complex and would have an impact on many aspects and operations of apollo  including but not limited to financial accounting and reporting systems  internal

it is expected that a significant amount of time  internal and external resources and expenses over a multi year period would be required for this conversion 
we face operational risk from errors made in the execution  confirmation or settlement of transactions and our dependence on our headquarters in new york city and third party providers may have an adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our businesses without interruption which could result in losses to us or limit our growth 
we face operational risk from errors made in the execution  confirmation or settlement of transactions 
we also face operational risk from transactions not being properly recorded  evaluated or accounted for in our funds 
in particular  our capital markets oriented credit business is highly dependent on our ability to process and evaluate  on a daily basis  transactions across markets and geographies in a time sensitive  efficient and accurate manner 
consequently  we rely heavily on our financial  accounting and other data processing systems 
new investment products we may introduce could create a significant risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to identify or control the relevant risks in the investment strategies employed by such new investment products 
in addition  our information systems and technology might not be able to accommodate our growth  and the cost of maintaining such systems might increase from its current level 
these risks could cause us to suffer financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to our funds  regulatory intervention and reputational damage 
furthermore  we depend on our headquarters  which is located in new york city  for the operation of many of our businesses 
a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses  including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business  or directly affecting our headquarters  may have an adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our businesses without interruption which could have a material adverse effect on us 
although we have disaster recovery programs in place  these may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption 
in addition  insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses 
finally  we rely on third party service providers for certain aspects of our businesses  including for certain information systems  technology and administration of our funds and compliance matters 
any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties could impair the quality of the funds operations and could impact our reputation and adversely affect our businesses and limit our ability to grow 
we rely on our information systems to conduct our business  and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
additionally  if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time  our business could be harmed 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems 
information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists 
we rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems 
however  these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches 
in addition  the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs  causing our business and results of operations to suffer 
any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from funds managed pursuant to management agreements that may be terminated or fund partnership agreements that permit fund investors to request liquidation of investments in our funds on short notice 
the terms of our funds generally give either the general partner of the fund or the fund s board of directors the right to terminate our investment management agreement with the fund 
however  insofar as we control the general partner of our funds that are limited partnerships  the risk of termination of investment management agreement for such funds is limited  subject to our fiduciary or contractual duties 
table of contents as general partner 
this risk is more significant for certain of our funds  which have independent boards of directors 
with respect to our funds that are subject to the investment company act  each fund s investment management agreement must be approved annually by such fund s board of directors or by the vote of a majority of the shareholders and the majority of the independent members of such fund s board of directors and  as required by law 
the funds investment management agreement can also be terminated by the majority of the shareholders 
termination of these agreements would reduce the fees we earn from the relevant funds  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
currently  aft and aif  registered investment companies under the investment company act  and ainv  a registered investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the investment company act  are subject to these provisions of the investment company act 
in addition  after undergoing the reorganization  we no longer consolidate in our financial statements certain of the funds that have historically been consolidated in our financial statements 
in connection with such deconsolidation  we amended the governing documents of those funds to provide that a simple majority of a fund s unaffiliated investors have the right to liquidate that fund  which would cause management fees and incentive income to terminate 
our ability to realize incentive income from such funds also would be adversely affected if we are required to liquidate fund investments at a time when market conditions result in our obtaining less for investments than could be obtained at later times 
we do not know whether  and under what circumstances  the investors in our funds are likely to exercise such right 
in addition  the management agreements of our funds would terminate if we were to experience a change of control without obtaining investor consent 
such a change of control could be deemed to occur in the event our managing partners exchange enough of their interests in the apollo operating group into our class a shares such that our managing partners no longer own a controlling interest in us 
we cannot be certain that consents required for the assignment of our management agreements will be obtained if such a deemed change of control occurs 
termination of these agreements would affect the fees we earn from the relevant funds and the transaction and advisory fees we earn from the underlying portfolio companies  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our use of leverage to finance our businesses will expose us to substantial risks  which are exacerbated by our funds use of leverage to finance investments 
we have loans outstanding under the amh credit agreement and the cit loan agreements described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we may choose to finance our business operations through further borrowings 
our existing and future indebtedness exposes us to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage  including those discussed above under dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments 
these risks are exacerbated by certain of our funds use of leverage to finance investments and  if they were to occur  could cause us to suffer a decline in the credit ratings assigned to our debt by rating agencies  if any  which might result in an increase in our borrowing costs or result in other material adverse effects on our businesses 
borrowings under the amh credit agreement are scheduled to mature either on april  or january  and borrowings under the cit loan agreements are scheduled to mature in april as these borrowings and other indebtedness mature or are otherwise repaid prior to their scheduled maturities  we may be required to either refinance them by entering into new facilities  which could result in higher borrowing costs  or issuing equity  which would dilute existing shareholders 
we could also repay them by using cash on hand or cash from the sale of our assets 
we could have difficulty entering into new facilities or issuing equity in the future on attractive terms  or at all 
borrowings under the amh credit agreement are floating rate obligations based on either the london interbank offered rate libor or the alternate base rate abr 
as a result  an increase in short term interest rates will increase our interest costs to the extent such borrowings have not been hedged into fixed rates 

table of contents we are subject to third party litigation that could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in general  we will be exposed to risk of litigation by our investors if our management of any fund is alleged to constitute bad faith  gross negligence  willful misconduct  fraud  willful or reckless disregard for our duties to the fund or other forms of misconduct 
investors could sue us to recover amounts lost by our funds due to our alleged misconduct  up to the entire amount of loss 
further  we may be subject to litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our funds or from allegations that we improperly exercised control or influence over companies in which our funds have large investments 
by way of example  we  our funds and certain of our employees are each exposed to the risks of litigation relating to investment activities in our funds and actions taken by the officers and directors some of whom may be apollo employees of portfolio companies  such as the risk of shareholder litigation by other shareholders of public companies in which our funds have large investments 
we are also exposed to risks of litigation or investigation relating to transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed 
in addition  our rights to indemnification by the funds we manage may not be upheld if challenged  and our indemnification rights generally do not cover bad faith  gross negligence  willful misconduct  fraud  willful or reckless disregard for our duties to the fund or other forms of misconduct 
if we are required to incur all or a portion of the costs arising out of litigation or investigations as a result of inadequate insurance proceeds or failure to obtain indemnification from our funds  our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  with a workforce that includes many very highly paid investment professionals  we face the risk of lawsuits relating to claims for compensation  which may individually or in the aggregate be significant in amount 
such claims are more likely to occur in the current environment where individual employees may experience significant volatility in their year to year compensation due to trading performance or other issues and in situations where previously highly compensated employees were terminated for performance or efficiency reasons 
the cost of settling such claims could adversely affect our results of operations 
if any lawsuits brought against us were to result in a finding of substantial legal liability  the lawsuit could  in addition to any financial damage  cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business 
we depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds 
as a result  allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators  whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us  as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us  our investment activities or the private equity industry in general  whether or not valid  may harm our reputation  which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses 
see item legal proceedings 
our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses 
as we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses  we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds investment activities 
certain of our funds may have overlapping investment objectives  including funds that have different fee structures  and potential conflicts may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those funds 
for example  a decision to acquire material non public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action 
in addition  fund investors or holders of class a shares may perceive conflicts of interest regarding investment decisions for funds in which our managing partners  who have and may continue to make significant personal investments in a variety of apollo funds  are personally invested 
similarly  conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of our investments and regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities among us and our funds and the allocation of fees and costs among us  our funds and their portfolio companies 
pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement  whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between any of the managing partners  one or more directors or their respective affiliates  on the one 
table of contents hand  and us  any of our subsidiaries or any shareholder other than a managing partner  on the other  any resolution or course of action by our board of directors shall be permitted and deemed approved by all shareholders if the resolution or course of action i has been specifically approved by a majority of the voting power of our outstanding voting shares excluding voting shares owned by our manager or its affiliates or by a conflicts committee of the board of directors composed entirely of one or more independent directors  ii is on terms no less favorable to us or our shareholders other than a managing partner than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or iii it is fair and reasonable to us and our shareholders taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved 
all conflicts of interest described in this report will be deemed to have been specifically approved by all shareholders 
notwithstanding the foregoing  it is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor dissatisfaction or litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 
appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest 
regulatory scrutiny of  or litigation in connection with  conflicts of interest would have a material adverse effect on our reputation which would materially adversely affect our businesses in a number of ways  including as a result of redemptions by our investors from our funds  an inability to raise additional funds and a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us 
our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses  and we may expand into new investment strategies  geographic markets and businesses  each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses 
we intend  to the extent that market conditions warrant  to grow our businesses by increasing aum in existing businesses and expanding into new investment strategies  geographic markets and businesses 
our organizational documents  however  do not limit us to the investment management business 
accordingly  we may pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies  acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives  which may include entering into new lines of business  such as the insurance  broker dealer or financial advisory industries 
in addition  we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other alternative or traditional asset managers 
to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions  undertake other strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business  we will face numerous risks and uncertainties  including risks associated with i the required investment of capital and other resources  ii the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk  iii combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls and iv the broadening of our geographic footprint  including the risks associated with conducting operations in foreign jurisdictions 
entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar  or from which we are currently exempt  and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk 
if a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures  in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon  and subject to liability  losses or reputational damage relating to  systems  controls and personnel that are not under our control 
employee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and by subjecting us to significant legal liability  regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm 
our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with the investors in our funds  potential fund investors and third parties with whom we do business 
in recent years  there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud  conflicts of interest or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry 
there is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our businesses 
for example  if an employee were to engage in illegal or suspicious activities  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation  financial position  investor relationships and ability to attract future investors 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases 
misconduct by our employees  or even unsubstantiated allegations  could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our businesses 

table of contents the due diligence process that we undertake in connection with investments by our funds may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment 
before making investments in private equity and other investments  we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment 
when conducting due diligence  we may be required to evaluate important and complex business  financial  tax  accounting  environmental and legal issues 
outside consultants  legal advisors  accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment 
nevertheless  when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment  we rely on the resources available to us  including information provided by the target of the investment and  in some circumstances  third party investigations 
the due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity 
moreover  such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment being successful 
certain of our funds utilize special situation and distressed debt investment strategies that involve significant risks 
our funds often invest in obligors and issuers with weak financial conditions  poor operating results  substantial financial needs  negative net worth and or special competitive problems 
these funds also invest in obligors and issuers that are involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings 
in such situations  it may be difficult to obtain full information as to the exact financial and operating conditions of these obligors and issuers 
additionally  the fair values of such investments are subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and significant price volatility if they are publicly traded securities  and are subject to significant uncertainty in general if they are not publicly traded securities 
furthermore  some of our funds distressed investments may not be widely traded or may have no recognized market 
a fund s exposure to such investments may be substantial in relation to the market for those investments  and the assets are likely to be illiquid and difficult to sell or transfer 
as a result  it may take a number of years for the market value of such investments to ultimately reflect their intrinsic value as perceived by us 
a central feature of our distressed investment strategy is our ability to successfully predict the occurrence of certain corporate events  such as debt and or equity offerings  restructurings  reorganizations  mergers  takeover offers and other transactions  that we believe will improve the condition of the business 
if the corporate event we predict is delayed  changed or never completed  the market price and value of the applicable fund s investment could decline sharply 
in addition  these investments could subject us to certain potential additional liabilities that may exceed the value of our original investment 
under certain circumstances  payments or distributions on certain investments may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance  a preferential payment or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws 
in addition  under certain circumstances  a lender that has inappropriately exercised control of the management and policies of a debtor may have its claims subordinated or disallowed  or may be found liable for damages suffered by parties as a result of such actions 
in the case where the investment in securities of troubled companies is made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in bankruptcy  our funds may become involved in substantial litigation 
we often pursue investment opportunities that involve business  regulatory  legal or other complexities 
as an element of our investment style  we often pursue unusually complex investment opportunities 
this can often take the form of substantial business  regulatory or legal complexity that would deter other investment managers 
our tolerance for complexity presents risks  as such transactions can be more difficult  expensive and time consuming to finance and execute  it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions  and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities 
any of these risks could harm the performance of our funds 
our funds make investments in companies that we do not control 

table of contents investments by some of our funds will include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control 
such instruments and securities may be acquired by our funds through trading activities or through purchases of securities from the issuer 
in addition  in the future  our funds may seek to acquire minority equity interests more frequently and may also dispose of a portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in the funds retaining a minority investment 
those investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business  financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests 
if any of the foregoing were to occur  the values of investments by our funds could decrease and our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result 
our funds may face risks relating to undiversified investments 
while diversification is generally an objective of our funds  we cannot give assurance as to the degree of diversification that will actually be achieved in any fund investments 
because a significant portion of a fund s capital may be invested in a single investment or portfolio company  a loss with respect to such investment or portfolio company could have a significant adverse impact on such fund s capital 
accordingly  a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could adversely affect a fund s performance and therefore  our financial condition and results of operations 
some of our funds invest in foreign countries and securities of issuers located outside of the united states  which may involve foreign exchange  political  social and economic uncertainties and risks 
some of our funds invest all or a portion of their assets in the equity  debt  loans or other securities of issuers located outside the united states  including germany  china and singapore 
in addition to business uncertainties  such investments may be affected by changes in exchange values as well as political  social and economic uncertainty affecting a country or region 
many financial markets are not as developed or as efficient as those in the united states  and as a result  liquidity may be reduced and price volatility may be higher 
the legal and regulatory environment may also be different  particularly with respect to bankruptcy and reorganization 
financial accounting standards and practices may differ  and there may be less publicly available information in respect of such companies 
restrictions imposed or actions taken by foreign governments may adversely impact the value of our fund investments 
such restrictions or actions could include exchange controls  seizure or nationalization of foreign deposits or other assets and adoption of other governmental restrictions that adversely affect the prices of securities or the ability to repatriate profits on investments or the capital invested itself 
income received by our funds from sources in some countries may be reduced by withholding and other taxes 
any such taxes paid by a fund will reduce the net income or return from such investments 
while our funds will take these factors into consideration in making investment decisions  including when hedging positions  our funds may not be able to fully avoid these risks or generate sufficient risk adjusted returns 
third party investors in our funds will have the right under certain circumstances to terminate commitment periods or to dissolve the funds  and investors in our credit funds may redeem their investments in our credit funds at any time after an initial holding period of to months 
these events would lead to a decrease in our revenues  which could be substantial 
the governing agreements of certain of our funds allow the limited partners of those funds to i terminate the commitment period of the fund in the event that certain key persons for example  one or more of our managing partners and or certain other investment professionals fail to devote the requisite time to managing the fund  ii depending on the fund terminate the commitment period  dissolve the fund or remove the general partner if we  as general partner or manager  or certain key persons engage in certain forms of misconduct  or iii dissolve the fund or terminate the commitment period upon the affirmative vote of a specified percentage of limited partner interests entitled to vote 
both fund vi and fund vii  on which our near to medium term performance will heavily depend  include a number of such provisions 
also  after undergoing the reorganization  subsequent to which we deconsolidated certain funds that have historically been consolidated in our financial statements  we amended the governing documents of those funds to provide that a simple majority of a fund s unaffiliated investors have the right to liquidate 
table of contents that fund 
in addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue  net income and cash flow  the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our funds would likely result in significant reputational damage to us 
investors in our credit funds may also generally redeem their investments on an annual  semiannual or quarterly basis following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be redeemed typically between one and five years 
fund investors may decide to move their capital away from us to other investments for any number of reasons in addition to poor investment performance 
factors which could result in investors leaving our funds include changes in interest rates that make other investments more attractive  changes in investor perception regarding our focus or alignment of interest  unhappiness with changes in or broadening of a fund s investment strategy  changes in our reputation and departures or changes in responsibilities of key investment professionals 
in a declining market  the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our assets under management could accelerate 
the decrease in revenues that would result from significant redemptions in these funds could have a material adverse effect on our businesses  revenues  net income and cash flows 
in addition  the management agreements of all of our funds would be terminated upon an assignment  without the requisite consent  of these agreements  which may be deemed to occur in the event the investment advisors of our funds were to experience a change of control 
we cannot be certain that consents required to assign our investment management agreements will be obtained if a change of control occurs 
in addition  with respect to our publicly traded closed end funds  each fund s investment management agreement must be approved annually by the independent members of such fund s board of directors and  in certain cases  by its stockholders  as required by law 
termination of these agreements would cause us to lose the fees we earn from such funds 
our financial projections for portfolio companies could prove inaccurate 
our funds generally establish the capital structure of portfolio companies on the basis of financial projections for such portfolio companies 
these projected operating results will normally be based primarily on management judgments 
in all cases  projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed 
general economic conditions  which are not predictable  along with other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of the financial projections we used to establish a given portfolio company s capital structure 
because of the leverage we typically employ in our investments  this could cause a substantial decrease in the value of our equity holdings in the portfolio company 
the inaccuracy of financial projections could thus cause our funds performance to fall short of our expectations 
our private equity funds performance  and our performance  may be adversely affected by the financial performance of our portfolio companies and the industries in which our funds invest 
our performance and the performance of our private equity funds is significantly impacted by the value of the companies in which our funds have invested 
our funds invest in companies in many different industries  each of which is subject to volatility based upon economic and market factors 
over the last few years  the credit crisis has caused significant fluctuations in the value of securities held by our funds and the global economic recession had a significant impact in overall performance activity and the demands for many of the goods and services provided by portfolio companies of the funds we manage 
although the us economy has improved  there remain many obstacles to continued growth in the economy such as high unemployment  global geopolitical events  risks of inflation and high deficit levels for governmental agencies in the us and abroad 
these factors and other general economic trends are likely to impact the performance of portfolio companies in many industries and in particular  industries that are more impacted by changes in consumer demand  such as the packaging  manufacturing  chemical and refining industries  as well as travel and real estate industries 
the performance of our private equity funds  and our performance  may be adversely affected to the extent our fund portfolio companies in these industries experience adverse performance or additional pressure due to downward trends 
for example  the performance of certain of our portfolio companies in the packaging  manufacturing  chemical and refining industries is subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply demand balance in these industries 
these industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages leading to tight supply conditions  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods when substantial 
table of contents capacity is added  resulting in oversupply  declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 
in addition to changes in the supply and demand for products  the volatility these industries experience occurs as a result of changes in energy prices  costs of raw materials and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 
the performance of our investments in the commodities markets is also subject to a high degree of business and market risk  as it is substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as level of consumer product demand  the refining capacity of oil purchasers  weather conditions  government regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions  foreign supply of such commodities and overall economic conditions 
it is common in making investments in the commodities markets to deploy hedging strategies to protect against pricing fluctuations but that may or may not protect our investments 
similarly  the performance of cruise ship operations is also susceptible to adverse changes in the economic climate  such as higher fuel prices  as increases in the cost of fuel globally would increase the cost of cruise ship operations 
economic and political conditions in certain parts of the world make it difficult to predict the price of fuel in the future 
in addition  cruise ship operators could experience increases in other operating costs  such as crew  insurance and security costs  due to market forces and economic or political instability beyond their control 
in respect of real estate  even though the us residential real estate market has recently shown some signs of stabilizing from a lengthy and deep downturn  various factors could halt or limit a recovery in the housing market and have an adverse effect on the companies performance  including  but not limited to  continued high unemployment  a low level of consumer confidence in the economy and or the residential real estate market and rising mortgage interest rates 
in addition  our funds investments in commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate related loans are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure  and risks of loss that are greater than similar risks associated with mortgage loans made on the security of residential properties 
if the net operating income of the commercial property is reduced  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
net operating income of a commercial property can be affected by various factors  such as success of tenant businesses  property management decisions  competition from comparable types of properties and declines in regional or local real estate values and rental or occupancy rates 
fraud and other deceptive practices could harm fund performance 
instances of fraud and other deceptive practices committed by senior management of portfolio companies in which an apollo fund invests may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies  and if such fraud is discovered  negatively affect the valuation of a fund s investments 
in addition  when discovered  financial fraud may contribute to overall market volatility that can negatively impact an apollo fund s investment program 
as a result  instances of fraud could result in fund performance that is poorer than expected 
contingent liabilities could harm fund performance 
we may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities 
such contingent liabilities could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or  if they are known to us  we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present 
acquired contingent liabilities could thus result in unforeseen losses for our funds 
in addition  in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company  a fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business 
a fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are inaccurate 
these arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund  even after the disposition of an investment 
accordingly  the inaccuracy of representations and warranties made by a fund could harm such fund s performance 

table of contents our funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time 
our funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved  either by expiration of such fund s term or otherwise 
although we generally expect that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in kind distribution at dissolution  and the general partners of the funds have a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund  as applicable  our funds may have to sell  distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of dissolution 
this would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and  perhaps  on the fund itself 
possession of material  non public information could prevent apollo funds from undertaking advantageous transactions  our internal controls could fail  we could determine to establish information barriers 
our managing partners  investment professionals or other employees may acquire confidential or material non public information and  as a result  be restricted from initiating transactions in certain securities 
this risk affects us more than it does many other investment managers  as we generally do not use information barriers that many firms implement to separate persons who make investment decisions from others who might possess material  non public information that could influence such decisions 
our decision not to implement these barriers could prevent our investment professionals from undertaking advantageous investments or dispositions that would be permissible for them otherwise 
in order to manage possible risks resulting from our decision not to implement information barriers  our compliance personnel maintain a list of restricted securities as to which we have access to material  non public information and in which our funds and investment professionals are not permitted to trade 
this internal control relating to the management of material non public information could fail with the result that we  or one of our investment professionals  might trade when at least constructively in possession of material non public information 
inadvertent trading on material non public information could have adverse effects on our reputation  result in the imposition of regulatory or financial sanctions and as a consequence  negatively impact our financial condition 
in addition  we could in the future decide that it is advisable to establish information barriers  particularly as our business expands and diversifies 
in such event  our ability to operate as an integrated platform will be restricted 
the establishment of such information barriers may also lead to operational disruptions and result in restructuring costs  including costs related to hiring additional personnel as existing investment professionals are allocated to either side of such barriers  which may adversely affect our business 
regulations governing ainv s operation as a business development company affect its ability to raise  and the way in which it raises  additional capital 
as a business development company under the investment company act  ainv may issue debt securities or preferred stock and borrow money from banks or other financial institutions  which we refer to collectively as senior securities  up to the maximum amount permitted by the investment company act 
under the provisions of the investment company act  ainv is permitted to issue senior securities only in amounts such that its asset coverage  as defined in the investment company act  equals at least after each issuance of senior securities 
if the value of its assets declines  it may be unable to satisfy this test 
if that happens  it may be required to sell a portion of its investments and  depending on the nature of its leverage  repay a portion of its indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous 
business development companies may issue and sell common stock at a price below net asset value per share only in limited circumstances  one of which is during the one year period after stockholder approval 
ainv s stockholders have  in the past  approved a plan so that during the subsequent month period  ainv may  in one or more public or private offerings of its common stock  sell or otherwise issue shares of its common stock at a price below the then current net asset value per share  subject to certain conditions including parameters on the level of permissible dilution  approval of the sale by a majority of its independent directors and a requirement that the sale price be not less than approximately the market price of the shares of its common stock at specified times  less the expenses of the sale 
ainv may ask its stockholders for additional approvals from year to year 
there is no assurance such approvals will be obtained 

table of contents our credit funds are subject to numerous additional risks 
our credit funds are subject to numerous additional risks  including the risks set forth below 
generally  there are few limitations on the execution of these funds investment strategies  which are subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds 
these funds may engage in short selling  which is subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss 
these funds are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract whether or not bona fide or because of a credit or liquidity problem  thus causing the fund to suffer a loss 
credit risk may arise through a default by one of several large institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their liquidity or operational needs  so that a default by one institution causes a series of defaults by the other institutions 
the efficacy of investment and trading strategies depend largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments  which can be difficult to execute 
these funds may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which may become illiquid 
these funds investments are subject to risks relating to investments in commodities  futures  options and other derivatives  the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances 
risks related to our class a shares the market price and trading volume of our class a shares may be volatile  which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders 
the market price of our class a shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations

if the market price of our class a shares declines significantly  you may be unable to resell your class a shares at or above your purchase price  if at all 
the market price of our class a shares may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our class a shares or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our class a shares include variations in our quarterly operating results or distributions  which variations we expect will be substantial  our policy of taking a long term perspective on making investment  operational and strategic decisions  which is expected to result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns  failure to meet analysts earnings estimates  publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our class a shares

our class a share price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale and for exchange into class a shares 
the market price of our class a shares could decline as a result of sales of a large number of our class a shares or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate

we cannot assure you that our intended quarterly distributions will be paid each quarter or at all 
our intention is to distribute to our class a shareholders on a quarterly basis substantially all of our net after tax cash flow from operations in excess of amounts determined by our manager to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our businesses  to make appropriate investments in our businesses and our funds  to comply with applicable laws and regulations  to service our indebtedness or to provide for future distributions to our class a shareholders for any ensuing quarter

our managing partners beneficial ownership of interests in the class b share that we have issued to brh holdings gp  ltd 
brh  the control exercised by our manager and anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control 
our managing partners  through their ownership of brh  beneficially own the class b share that we have issued to brh 
the managing partners interests in such class b share represented of the total combined voting power of our shares entitled to vote as of december  as a result  they are able to exercise control over all matters requiring the approval of shareholders and are able to prevent a change in control of our company 
in addition  our operating agreement provides that so long as the apollo control condition as described in item directors  executive officers and corporate governance our manager is satisfied  our manager  which is owned and controlled by our managing partners  manages all of our operations and activities 
the control of our manager will make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to assume control of our company 
other provisions in our operating agreement may also make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our shareholders 
for example  our operating agreement requires advance notice for proposals by shareholders and nominations  places limitations on convening shareholder meetings  and authorizes the issuance of preferred shares that could be issued by our board of directors to 
table of contents thwart a takeover attempt 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law may delay or prevent a transaction that could cause a change in our control 
the market price of our class a shares could be adversely affected to the extent that our managing partners control over our company  the control exercised by our manager as well as provisions of our operating agreement discourage potential takeover attempts that our shareholders may favor 
we are a delaware limited liability company  and there are certain provisions in our operating agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that differ from the delaware general corporation law dgcl in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our class a shareholders 
our operating agreement provides that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law our directors or officers will not be liable to us 
however  under the dgcl  a director or officer would be liable to us for i breach of duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders  ii intentional misconduct or knowing violations of the law that are not done in good faith  iii improper redemption of shares or declaration of dividend  or iv a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit 
in addition  our operating agreement provides that we indemnify our directors and officers for acts or omissions to the fullest extent provided by law 
however  under the dgcl  a corporation can only indemnify directors and officers for acts or omissions if the director or officer acted in good faith  in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation  and  in criminal action  if the officer or director had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful 
accordingly  our operating agreement may be less protective of the interests of our class a shareholders  when compared to the dgcl  insofar as it relates to the exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors 
risks related to our organization and structure although not enacted  the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a ten year transition period  precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable corporations  and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates 
if similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us  the value of our class a shares could be adversely affected 
the us congress  the irs and the us treasury department have recently examined the us federal income tax treatment of private equity funds  hedge funds and other kinds of investment partnerships 
the present us federal income tax treatment of a holder of class a shares and or our own taxation may be adversely affected by any new legislation  new regulations or revised interpretations of existing tax law that arise as a result of such examinations 
in may  the us house of representatives passed legislation the may house bill that would have  in general  treated income and gains  including gain on sale  attributable to an interest in an investment services partnership interest ispi as income subject to a new blended tax rate that is higher than under current law  except to the extent such ispi would have been considered under the legislation to be a qualified capital interest 
the interests of class a shareholders and our interests in the apollo operating group that are entitled to receive carried interest may be classified as ispis for purposes of this legislation 
the united states senate considered  but did not pass  similar legislation 
on february   representative levin introduced similar legislation the levin bill that would tax carried interest at ordinary income rates which would be higher than the proposed blended rate in the may house bill 
it is unclear when or whether the us congress will pass such legislation or what provisions would be included in any legislation  if enacted 
both the may house bill and the levin bill provide that  for taxable years beginning ten years after the date of enactment  income derived with respect to an ispi that is not a qualified capital interest and that is treated as ordinary income under the rules discussed above would not meet the qualifying income requirements under the publicly traded partnership rules 
therefore  if similar legislation were to be enacted  following such ten year period  we would be precluded from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or be required to hold all such ispis through corporations  possibly us corporations 
if we were taxed as a us corporation or required to hold all ispis through corporations  our effective tax rate would increase significantly 
the federal statutory rate for corporations is currently 
in addition  we could be subject to increased state and local taxes 
furthermore  holders of class a 
table of contents shares could be subject to tax on our conversion into a corporation or any restructuring required in order for us to hold our ispis through a corporation 
on september   the obama administration submitted similar legislation to congress in the american jobs act that would tax income and gain  now treated as capital gains  including gain on disposition of interests attributable to an ispi  at rates higher than the capital gains rate applicable to such income under current law  with an exception for certain qualified capital interests 
the proposed legislation would also characterize certain income and gain in respect of ispis as non qualifying income under the publicly traded partnership rules after a ten year transition period from the effective date  with an exception for certain qualified capital interests 
this proposed legislation follows several prior statements by the obama administration in support of changing the taxation of carried interest 
furthermore  in the proposed american jobs act  the obama administration proposed that current law regarding the treatment of carried interest be changed for taxable years ending after december  to subject such income to ordinary income tax 
in its published revenue proposal for  the obama administration proposed that the current law regarding treatment of carried interest be changed to subject such income to ordinary income tax 
the obama administration s published revenue proposals for  and contained similar proposals 
states and other jurisdictions have also considered legislation to increase taxes with respect to carried interest 
for example  new york has periodically considered legislation under which you could be subject to new york state income tax on income in respect of our class a shares as a result of certain activities of our affiliates in new york  although it is unclear when or whether such legislation would be enacted 
on february   the obama administration announced its framework of key elements to change the us federal income tax rules for businesses 
few specifics were included  and it is unclear what any actual legislation could provide  when it would be proposed  or its prospects for enactment 
several parts of the framework  if enacted  could adversely affect us 
first  the framework could reduce the deductibility of interest for corporations in some manner not specified 
a reduction in interest deductions could increase our tax rate and thereby reduce cash available for distribution to investors or for other uses by us 
such a reduction could also limit our ability to finance new transactions and increase the effective cost of financing by companies in which we invest  which could reduce the value of our carried interest in respect of such companies 
the framework also suggests that some entities currently treated as partnerships for tax purposes could be subject to an entity level income tax similar to the corporate income tax 
if such a proposal caused us to be subject to additional entity level taxes  it could reduce cash available for distribution to investors or for other uses by us 
the framework reiterates the president s support for treatment of carried interest as ordinary income  as provided in the president s revenue proposal for described above 
however  whether the president s framework will actually be enacted by the government is unknown  and the ultimate consequences of tax reform legislation  if any  are also presently not known 
our shareholders do not elect our manager or vote and have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our businesses 
so long as the apollo control condition is satisfied  our manager  agm management  llc  which is owned and controlled by our managing partners  will manage all of our operations and activities 
agm management  llc is managed by brh  a cayman entity owned by our managing partners and managed by an executive committee composed of our managing partners 
our shareholders do not elect our manager  its manager or its manager s executive committee and  unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our businesses and therefore limited ability to influence decisions regarding our businesses 
furthermore  if our shareholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our manager  they will have little ability to remove our manager 
as discussed below  the managing partners collectively had of the voting power of apollo global management  llc as of december  therefore  they have the ability to control any shareholder vote that occurs  including any vote regarding the removal of our manager 

table of contents control by our managing partners of the combined voting power of our shares and holding their economic interests through the apollo operating group may give rise to conflicts of interests 
our managing partners controlled of the combined voting power of our shares entitled to vote as of december  accordingly  our managing partners have the ability to control our management and affairs to the extent not controlled by our manager 
in addition  they are able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval such as a proposed sale of all or substantially of our assets  the approval of a merger or consolidation involving the company  and an election by our manager to dissolve the company and are able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company 
the control of voting power by our managing partners could deprive class a shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their class a shares as part of a sale of our company  and might ultimately affect the market price of the class a shares 
in addition  our managing partners and contributing partners  through their partnership interests in holdings  are entitled to of apollo operating group s economic returns through the aog units owned by holdings as of december  because they hold their economic interest in our businesses directly through the apollo operating group  rather than through the issuer of the class a shares  our managing partners and contributing partners may have conflicting interests with holders of class a shares 
for example  our managing partners and contributing partners may have different tax positions from us  which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets  and whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness  especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreement 
for a description of the tax receivable agreement  see item certain relationships and related party transactions tax receivable agreement 
in addition  the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration the managing partners and contributing partners tax considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us 
we qualify for  and rely on  exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the nyse 
we qualify for exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the nyse 
pursuant to these exceptions  we may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the nyse  including the requirements i that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors  ii that we have a nominating corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and iii that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors 
in addition  we are not required to hold annual meetings of our shareholders 
although we currently have a board of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors  we plan to continue to avail ourselves of these exceptions 
accordingly  you will not have the same protections afforded to equity holders of entities that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse 
potential conflicts of interest may arise among our manager  on the one hand  and us and our shareholders on the other hand 
our manager and its affiliates have limited fiduciary duties to us and our shareholders  which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our shareholders 
conflicts of interest may arise among our manager  on the one hand  and us and our shareholders  on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts  our manager may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of us and our shareholders 
these conflicts include  among others  the conflicts described below 
our manager determines the amount and timing of our investments and dispositions  indebtedness  issuances of additional stock and amounts of reserves  each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to you 
our manager is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us in resolving conflicts of interest  which has the effect of limiting its duties including fiduciary duties to our shareholders  for example  our affiliates that serve as general partners of our funds have fiduciary and contractual obligations to our fund 
table of contents investors  and such obligations may cause such affiliates to regularly take actions that might adversely affect our near term results of operations or cash flow  our manager has no obligation to intervene in  or to notify our shareholders of  such actions by such affiliates 
because our managing partners and contributing partners hold their aog units through entities that are not subject to corporate income taxation and apollo global management  llc holds the aog units in part through a wholly owned subsidiary that is subject to corporate income taxation  conflicts may arise between our managing partners and contributing partners  on the one hand  and apollo global management  llc  on the other hand  relating to the selection and structuring of investments 
other than as set forth in the non competition  non solicitation and confidentiality agreements to which our managing partners and other professionals are subject  which may not be enforceable  affiliates of our manager and existing and former personnel employed by our manager are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities  including those that might be in direct competition with us 
our manager has limited its liability and reduced or eliminated its duties including fiduciary duties under our operating agreement  while also restricting the remedies available to our shareholders for actions that  without these limitations  might constitute breaches of duty including fiduciary duty 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify our manager and its affiliates to the fullest extent permitted by law  except with respect to conduct involving bad faith  fraud or willful misconduct 
by purchasing our class a shares  you will have agreed and consented to the provisions set forth in our operating agreement  including the provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that  in the absence of such provisions  might constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law 
our operating agreement does not restrict our manager from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered  or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf  so long as the terms of any such additional contractual arrangements are fair and reasonable to us as determined under the operating agreement 
our manager determines how much debt we incur and that decision may adversely affect our credit ratings 
our manager determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us 
our manager controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates 
our manager decides whether to retain separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for us 
see item certain relationships and related party transactions for a more detailed discussion of these conflicts 
our operating agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties including fiduciary duties of our manager and limit remedies available to shareholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of duty 
it will be difficult for a shareholder to challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our manager or by its conflicts committee 
our operating agreement contains provisions that waive or consent to conduct by our manager and its affiliates that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law 
for example  our operating agreement provides that when our manager is acting in its individual capacity  as opposed to in its capacity as our manager  it may act without any fiduciary obligations to us or our 
table of contents shareholders whatsoever 
when our manager  in its capacity as our manager  is permitted to or required to make a decision in its sole discretion or discretion or that it deems necessary or appropriate or necessary or advisable  then our manager will be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires  including its own interests  and will have no duty or obligation fiduciary or otherwise to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting us or any of our shareholders and will not be subject to any different standards imposed by our operating agreement  the delaware limited liability company act or under any other law  rule or regulation or in equity 
whenever a potential conflict of interest exists between us and our manager  our manager may resolve such conflict of interest 
if our manager determines that its resolution of the conflict of interest is on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or is fair and reasonable to us  taking into account the totality of the relationships between us and our manager  then it will be presumed that in making this determination  our manager acted in good faith 
a shareholder seeking to challenge this resolution of the conflict of interest would bear the burden of overcoming such presumption 
this is different from the situation with delaware corporations  where a conflict resolution by an interested party would be presumed to be unfair and the interested party would have the burden of demonstrating that the resolution was fair 
the above modifications of fiduciary duties are expressly permitted by delaware law 
hence  we and our shareholders will only have recourse and be able to seek remedies against our manager if our manager breaches its obligations pursuant to our operating agreement 
unless our manager breaches its obligations pursuant to our operating agreement  we and our unitholders will not have any recourse against our manager even if our manager were to act in a manner that was inconsistent with traditional fiduciary duties 
furthermore  even if there has been a breach of the obligations set forth in our operating agreement  our operating agreement provides that our manager and its officers and directors will not be liable to us or our shareholders for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the manager or its officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct 
these provisions are detrimental to the shareholders because they restrict the remedies available to them for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty  including fiduciary duties 
also  if our manager obtains the approval of its conflicts committee  the resolution will be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to us and not a breach by our manager of any duties it may owe to us or our shareholders 
this is different from the situation with delaware corporations  where a conflict resolution by a committee consisting solely of independent directors may  in certain circumstances  merely shift the burden of demonstrating unfairness to the plaintiff 
if you purchase a class a share  you will be treated as having consented to the provisions set forth in the operating agreement  including provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that  in the absence of such provisions  might be considered a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law 
as a result  shareholders will  as a practical matter  not be able to successfully challenge an informed decision by the conflicts committee 
the control of our manager may be transferred to a third party without shareholder consent 
our manager may transfer its manager interest to a third party in a merger or consolidation or in a transfer of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our shareholders 
furthermore  at any time  the partners of our manager may sell or transfer all or part of their partnership interests in our manager without the approval of the shareholders  subject to certain restrictions as described elsewhere in this report 
a new manager may not be willing or able to form new funds and could form funds that have investment objectives and governing terms that differ materially from those of our current funds 
a new owner could also have a different investment philosophy  employ investment professionals who are less experienced  be unsuccessful in identifying investment opportunities or have a track record that is not as successful as apollo s track record 
if any of the foregoing were to occur  we could experience difficulty in making new investments  and the value of our existing investments  our businesses  our results of operations and our financial condition could materially suffer 

table of contents our ability to pay regular distributions may be limited by our holding company structure 
we are dependent on distributions from the apollo operating group to pay distributions  taxes and other expenses 
as a holding company  our ability to pay distributions will be subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide cash to us 
we intend to distribute quarterly distributions to our class a shareholders 
accordingly  we expect to cause the apollo operating group to make distributions to its unitholders in other words  holdings  which is owned  directly and indirectly  by our managing partners and our contributing partners  and the three intermediate holding companies  which are owned by us  pro rata in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay such distributions to our class a shareholders  however  such distributions may not be made 
in addition  our manager can reduce or eliminate our dividend at any time  in its discretion 
the apollo operating group intends to make periodic distributions to its unitholders in amounts sufficient to cover hypothetical income tax obligations attributable to allocations of taxable income resulting from their ownership interest in the various limited partnerships making up the apollo operating group  subject to compliance with any financial covenants or other obligations 
tax distributions will be calculated assuming each shareholder was subject to the maximum corporate or individual  whichever is higher combined us federal  new york state and new york city tax rates  without regard to whether any shareholder was subject to income tax liability at those rates 
if the apollo operating group has insufficient funds  we may have to borrow additional funds or sell assets  which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
furthermore  by paying that cash distribution rather than investing that cash in our business  we might risk slowing the pace of our growth or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations  new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise 
because tax distributions to unitholders are made without regard to their particular tax situation  tax distributions to all unitholders  including our intermediate holding companies  were increased to reflect the disproportionate income allocation to our managing partners and contributing partners with respect to built in gain assets at the time of the private offering transactions 
there may be circumstances under which we are restricted from paying distributions under applicable law or regulation for example  due to delaware limited partnership or limited liability company act limitations on making distributions if liabilities of the entity after the distribution would exceed the value of the entity s assets 
in addition  under the amh credit agreement  apollo management holdings is restricted in its ability to make cash distributions to us and may be forced to use cash to collateralize the amh credit agreement  which would reduce the cash it has available to make distributions 
tax consequences to our managing partners and contributing partners may give rise to conflicts of interests 
as a result of unrealized built in gain attributable to the value of our assets held by the apollo operating group entities at the time of the private offering transactions  upon the sale  refinancing or disposition of the assets owned by the apollo operating group entities  our managing partners and contributing partners will incur different and significantly greater tax liabilities as a result of the disproportionately greater allocations of items of taxable income and gain to the managing partners and contributing partners upon a realization event 
as the managing partners and contributing partners will not receive a corresponding greater distribution of cash proceeds  they may  subject to applicable fiduciary or contractual duties  have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing  timing and other material terms of any sale  refinancing  or disposition  or whether to sell such assets at all 
decisions made with respect to an acceleration or deferral of income or the sale or disposition of assets with unrealized built in gains may also influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by an exchanging or selling founder or partner under the tax receivable agreement 
all other factors being equal  earlier disposition of assets with unrealized built in gains following such exchange will tend to accelerate such payments and increase the present value of the tax receivable agreement  and disposition of assets with unrealized built in gains before an exchange will increase a managing partner s or contributing partner s tax liability without giving rise to any rights to receive payments under the tax receivable agreement 
decisions made regarding a change of control also could have a material influence on the timing and amount of payments received by our managing partners and contributing partners pursuant to the tax receivable agreement 

table of contents we are required to pay holdings for most of the actual tax benefits we realize as a result of the tax basis step up we receive in connection with taxable exchanges by our units held in the apollo operating group entities or our acquisitions of units from our managing partners and contributing partners 
subject to certain restrictions  each managing partner and contributing partner has the right to exchange the aog units that he holds through his partnership interest in holdings for our class a shares in a partially taxable transaction 
these exchanges  as well as our acquisitions of units from our managing partners or contributing partners  may result in increases in the tax basis of the intangible assets of the apollo operating group that otherwise would not have been available 
any such increases may reduce the amount of tax that apo corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of apollo global management  llc apo corp  would otherwise be required to pay in the future 
the irs may challenge all or part of these increased deductions and tax basis increases and a court could sustain such a challenge 
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with holdings that provides for the payment by apo corp 
to our managing partners and contributing partners of of the amount of actual tax savings  if any  that apo corp 
realizes or is deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by apo corp 
or a change of control  as discussed below as a result of these increases in tax deductions and tax basis of the apollo operating group 
in april  april and april  the apollo operating group made a distribution of million  million and million  respectively  to apo corp  and apo corp 
made payment to satisfy the liability under the tax receivable agreement to the managing partners and contributing partners from a realized tax benefit for the  and tax year 
in april  apo corp 
made payment of million pursuant to the tax receivable agreement 
prior to  the distribution percentage was governed by a special allocation as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
future payments that apo corp 
may make to our managing partners and contributing partners could be material in amount 
in the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire aog units in the future  or if we become taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  we expect  and have agreed that  each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms 
the irs could challenge our claim to any increase in the tax basis of the assets owned by the apollo operating group that results from the exchanges entered into by the managing partners or contributing partners 
the irs could also challenge any additional tax depreciation and amortization deductions or other tax benefits including deductions for imputed interest expense associated with payments made under the tax receivable agreement we claim as a result of  or in connection with  such increases in the tax basis of such assets 
if the irs were to successfully challenge a tax basis increase or tax benefits we previously claimed from a tax basis increase  holdings would not be obligated under the tax receivable agreement to reimburse apo corp 
for any payments previously made to them although any future payments would be adjusted to reflect the result of such challenge 
as a result  in certain circumstances  payments could be made to our managing partners and contributing partners under the tax receivable agreement in excess of of the actual aggregate cash tax savings of apo corp 
apo corp 
s ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase and the payments to be made under this agreement will depend upon a number of factors  including the timing and amount of its future income 
in addition  the tax receivable agreement provides that  upon a merger  asset sale or other form of business combination or certain other changes of control  apo corp 
s or its successor s obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired units whether exchanged or acquired before or after such change of control would be based on certain assumptions  including that apo corp 
would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement

however  if we were to be deemed an investment company  we would be taxed as a corporation and other restrictions imposed by the investment company act  including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates that apply to us  could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as contemplated and would have a material adverse effect on our businesses and the price of our class a shares 
risks related to taxation you will be subject to us federal income tax on your share of our taxable income  regardless of whether you receive any cash distributions from us 
under current law  so long as we are not required to register as an investment company under the investment company act and of our gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income within the meaning of the internal revenue code on a continuing basis  we will be treated  for us federal income tax purposes  as a partnership and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation 
you will be subject to us federal  state  local and possibly  in some cases  foreign income taxation on your allocable share of our items of income  gain  loss  deduction and credit for each of our taxable years ending with or within your taxable year  regardless of whether or not you receive cash distributions from us 
accordingly  you may be required to make tax payments in connection with your ownership of class a shares that significantly exceed your cash distributions in any specific year 
if we are treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  the value of the class a shares would be adversely affected 
the value of your investment will depend in part on our company being treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  which requires that or more of our gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income  as defined in section of the internal revenue code  and that we are not required to register as an investment company under the investment company act and related rules 
although we intend to manage our affairs so that our partnership will meet the test described above in each taxable year  we may not meet these requirements or  as discussed below  current law may change so as to cause  in either event  our partnership to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes 
if we were treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  i we would become subject to corporate income tax and ii distributions to shareholders would be taxable as dividends for us federal income tax purposes to the extent of our earnings and profits 
current law may change  causing us to be treated as a corporation for us federal or state income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us to entity level taxation 
see risks related to our organization and structure although not enacted  the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a ten year transition period  precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates 
if similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us  the value of our class a shares could be adversely affected 
because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  our distributions to you would be reduced 
our structure involves complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available 
our structure is also subject to potential legislative  judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations  possibly on a retroactive basis 
the us federal income tax treatment of holders of class a shares depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available 
you should be aware that the us federal income tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process  the irs and the us treasury department  frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts  statutory changes  revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations 
the irs pays close attention to the proper application of tax laws to partnerships and entities taxed as partnerships 
the present us federal income tax treatment of an investment in our class a shares may be modified by administrative  
table of contents legislative or judicial interpretation at any time  and any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made 
changes to the us federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for us to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a corporation  affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments  affect the tax considerations of an investment in us  change the character or treatment of portions of our income including  for instance  the treatment of carried interest as ordinary income rather than capital gain and adversely affect an investment in our class a shares 
for example  as discussed above under risks related to our organization and structure although not enacted  the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a ten year transition period  precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable corporations  and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates 
if similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us  the value of our class a shares could be adversely affected  the us congress has considered various legislative proposals to treat all or part of the capital gain and dividend income that is recognized by an investment partnership and allocable to a partner affiliated with the sponsor of the partnership ie  a portion of the carried interest as ordinary income to such partner for us federal income tax purposes 
our operating agreement permits our manager to modify our operating agreement from time to time  without the consent of the holders of class a shares  to address certain changes in us federal income tax regulations  legislation or interpretation 
in some circumstances  such revisions could have a material adverse impact on some or all holders of class a shares 
for instance  our manager could elect at some point to treat us as an association taxable as a corporation for us federal and applicable state income tax purposes 
if our manager were to do this  the us federal income tax consequences of owning our class a shares would be materially different 
moreover  we will apply certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with applicable rules and to report income  gain  deduction  loss and credit to holders of class a shares in a manner that reflects such beneficial ownership of items by holders of class a shares  taking into account variation in ownership interests during each taxable year because of trading activity 
however  those assumptions and conventions may not be in compliance with all aspects of applicable tax requirements 
it is possible that the irs will assert successfully that the conventions and assumptions used by us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the internal revenue code and or treasury regulations and could require that items of income  gain  deductions  loss or credit  including interest deductions  be adjusted  reallocated or disallowed in a manner that adversely affects holders of class a shares 
our interests in certain of our businesses are held through entities that are treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes  such corporations may be liable for significant taxes and may create other adverse tax consequences  which could potentially  adversely affect the value of your investment 
in light of the publicly traded partnership rules under us federal income tax law and other requirements  we hold our interests in certain of our businesses through entities that are treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes 
each such corporation could be liable for significant us federal income taxes and applicable state  local and other taxes that would not otherwise be incurred  which could adversely affect the value of your investment 
furthermore  it is possible that the irs could challenge the manner in which such corporation s taxable income is computed by us 
changes in us tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain foreign investors 
under the us foreign account tax compliance act  or fatca  all entities in a broadly defined class of foreign entities including foreign financial institutions  or ffis  are required to comply with a complicated and expansive reporting regime or  beginning in  be subject to a united states withholding tax on certain us payments and beginning in  a withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale of us stocks and securities and us entities which are not ffis are required to either certify they have no substantial us beneficial ownership or to report certain information with respect to their substantial us beneficial ownership or  beginning in  be subject to a us withholding tax on certain us payments and beginning in  a withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale of us stocks and securities 
the reporting obligations imposed under fatca require ffis to comply with agreements with the irs to obtain and disclose information about certain investors to the irs 
accordingly  
table of contents the administrative and economic costs of compliance with fatca may discourage some foreign investors from investing in us funds  which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors 
we may hold or acquire certain investments through an entity classified as a pfic or cfc for us federal income tax purposes 
certain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may be acquired through a foreign subsidiary that would be classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes 
such an entity may be a passive foreign investment company  or a pfic  or a controlled foreign corporation  or a cfc  for us federal income tax purposes 
for example  apo fc  llc is considered to be a cfc for us federal income tax purposes 
class a shareholders indirectly owning an interest in a pfic or a cfc may experience adverse us tax consequences  including the recognition of taxable income prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income 
in addition  gain on the sale of a pfic or cfc may be taxable at ordinary income tax rates 
complying with certain tax related requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive business or investment opportunities or enter into acquisitions  borrowings  financings or arrangements we may not have otherwise entered into 
in order for us to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  and not as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation  we must meet the qualifying income exception discussed above on a continuing basis and we must not be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act 
in order to effect such treatment we or our subsidiaries may be required to invest through foreign or domestic corporations  forego attractive business or investment opportunities or enter into borrowings or financings we may not have otherwise entered into 
this may cause us to incur additional tax liability and or adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize our cash flow 
our structure also may impede our ability to engage in certain corporate acquisitive transactions because we generally intend to hold all of our assets through the apollo operating group 
in addition  we may be unable to participate in certain corporate reorganization transactions that would be tax free to our holders if we were a corporation 
to the extent we hold assets other than through the apollo operating group  we will make appropriate adjustments to the apollo operating group agreements so that distributions to holdings and us would be the same as if such assets were held at that level 
moreover  we are precluded by a contract with one of the strategic investors from acquiring assets in a manner that would cause that strategic investor to be engaged in a commercial activity within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code 
tax gain or loss on disposition of our class a shares could be more or less than expected 
if you sell your class a shares  you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your adjusted tax basis allocated to those class a shares 
prior distributions to you in excess of the total net taxable income allocated to you will have decreased the tax basis in your class a shares 
therefore  such excess distributions will increase your taxable gain  or decrease your taxable loss  when the class a shares are sold and may result in a taxable gain even if the sale price is less than the original cost 
a portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be ordinary income to you 
we cannot match transferors and transferees of class a shares  and we have therefore adopted certain income tax accounting conventions that may not conform with all aspects of applicable tax requirements 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of our class a shares 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of class a shares  we have adopted depreciation  amortization and other tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to holders of class a shares 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of class a shares and could have a negative impact on the value of class a shares or result in audits of and adjustments to the tax returns of holders of class a shares 

table of contents the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profit interests will result in the termination of our partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have been terminated for us federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve month period 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all holders of class a shares and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
non us persons face unique non us tax issues from owning class a shares that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
in light of our investment activities  we may be  or may become  engaged in a us trade or business for us federal income tax purposes  in which case some portion of our income would be treated as effectively connected income with respect to non us holders of our class a shares  or eci 
moreover  dividends paid by an investment that we make in a real estate investment trust  or reit  that are attributable to gains from the sale of us real property interests and sales of certain investments in interests in us real property  including stock of certain us corporations owning significant us real property  may be treated as eci with respect to non us holders of our class a shares 
in addition  certain income of non us holders from us sources not connected to any us trade or business conducted by us could be treated as eci 
to the extent our income is treated as eci  each non us holder generally would be subject to withholding tax on its allocable share of such income  would be required to file a us federal income tax return for such year reporting its allocable share of income effectively connected with such trade or business and any other income treated as eci  and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular us tax rates on any such income state and local income taxes and filings may also apply in that event 
non us holders that are corporations may also be subject to a branch profits tax on their allocable share of such income 
in addition  certain income from us sources that is not eci allocable to us holders may be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest effective applicable tax rate 
an investment in class a shares will give rise to ubti to certain tax exempt holders 
we will not make investments through taxable us corporations solely for the purpose of limiting ubti from debt financed property and  thus  an investment in class a shares will give rise to ubti to tax exempt holders of class a shares 
apo asset co  llc may borrow funds from apo corp 
or third parties from time to time to make investments 
these investments will give rise to ubti from debt financed property 
moreover  if the irs successfully asserts that we are engaged in a trade or business  then additional amounts of income could be treated as ubti 
we do not intend to make  or cause to be made  an election under section of the internal revenue code to adjust our asset basis or the asset basis of certain of the apollo operating group partnerships 
thus  a holder of class a shares could be allocated more taxable income in respect of those class a shares prior to disposition than if such an election were made 
we did not make and currently do not intend to make  or cause to be made  an election to adjust asset basis under section of the internal revenue code with respect to apollo principal holdings i  lp  apollo principal holdings ii  lp  apollo principal holdings iii  lp  apollo principal holdings iv  lp  apollo principal holdings v  lp  apollo principal holdings vi  lp  apollo principal holdings vii  lp  apollo principal holdings viii  lp and apollo principal holdings ix  lp if no such election is made  there will generally be no adjustment for a transferee of class a shares even if the purchase price of those class a shares is higher than the class a shares share of the aggregate tax basis of our assets immediately prior to the transfer 
in that case  on a sale of an asset  gain allocable to a transferee could include built in gain allocable to the transferor at the time of the transfer  which built in gain would otherwise generally be eliminated if a section election had been made 
class a shareholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements as a result of investing in our class a shares 
in addition to us federal income taxes  our class a shareholders may be subject to other taxes  including state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future  
table of contents even if our class a shareholders do not reside in any of those jurisdictions 
our class a shareholders may also be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions 
further  class a shareholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
it is the responsibility of each class a shareholder to file all us federal  state and local tax returns that may be required of such class a shareholder 
we may not be able to furnish to each class a shareholder specific tax information within days after the close of each calendar year  which means that holders of class a shares who are us taxpayers should anticipate the need to file annually a request for an extension of the due date of their income tax return 
in addition  it is possible that class a shareholders may be required to file amended income tax returns 
as a publicly traded partnership  our operating results  including distributions of income  dividends  gains  losses or deductions and adjustments to carrying basis  will be reported on schedule k and distributed to each class a shareholder annually 
it may require longer than days after the end of our fiscal year to obtain the requisite information from all lower tier entities so that k s may be prepared for us 
for this reason  class a shareholders who are us taxpayers should anticipate the need to file annually with the irs and certain states a request for an extension past april or the otherwise applicable due date of their income tax return for the taxable year 
in addition  it is possible that a class a shareholder will be required to file amended income tax returns as a result of adjustments to items on the corresponding income tax returns of the partnership 
any obligation for a class a shareholder to file amended income tax returns for that or any other reason  including any costs incurred in the preparation or filing of such returns  are the responsibility of each class a shareholder 
you may be subject to an additional us federal income tax on net investment income allocated to you by us and on gain on the sale of the class a shares 
as of  individuals  estates and trusts are subject to an additional tax on net investment income or undistributed net investment income  in the case of estates and trusts for each taxable year  with such tax applying to the lesser of such income or the excess of such person s adjusted gross income with certain adjustments over a specified amount 
net investment income includes net income from interest  dividends  annuities  royalties and rents and net gain attributable to the disposition of investment property 
it is anticipated that net income and gain attributable to an investment in us will be included in a holder of the class a share s net investment income subject to this additional tax

on july   apollo was joined as a defendant in a pre existing purported class action pending in massachusetts federal court against  among other defendants  numerous private equity firms 
the suit alleges that beginning in mid  apollo and the other private equity firm defendants violated the us antitrust laws by forming bidding clubs or consortia that  among other things  rigged the bidding for control of various public corporations  restricted the supply of private equity financing  fixed the prices for target companies at artificially low levels  and allocated amongst themselves an alleged market for private equity services in leveraged buyouts 
the suit seeks class action certification  declaratory and injunctive relief  unspecified damages  and attorneys fees 
on august   apollo and its co defendants 
table of contents moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint and on november   the court granted apollo s motion 
the court also dismissed two other defendants  permira and merrill lynch 
on september   the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the complaint by adding an additional eight transactions and adding apollo as a defendant 
on october   the court granted plaintiffs motion to file that amended complaint 
plaintiffs fourth amended complaint  filed on october   adds apollo as a defendant 
apollo joined in the other defendants october  motion to dismiss the third claim for relief and all claims by the panamsat damages sub class in the fourth amended complaint  which motion was granted on january  on november   apollo moved to dismiss  arguing that the claims against apollo are time barred and that the allegations against apollo are insufficient to state an antitrust conspiracy claim 
on february   the court denied apollo s motion to dismiss  ruling that apollo should raise the statute of limitations issues on summary judgment after discovery is completed 
apollo filed its answer to the fourth amended complaint on march  on july   the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint  adding ten additional transactions and expanding the scope of the class seeking relief 
on september   the court denied the motion for leave to amend without prejudice and gave plaintiffs permission to take limited discovery on the ten additional transactions 
by court order  the parties concluded discovery on may  the plaintiffs then filed a fifth amended complaint on june  one week later  the defendants filed a motion to dismiss portions of the fifth amended complaint 
on july   the court granted the defendants motion in part and denied it in part 
on july   all defendants filed motions for summary judgment 
while those motions were pending  the new york times moved to intervene and unseal the fifth amended complaint 
after a court order  the defendants submitted a version of the complaint containing only four redactions 
the court publicly filed this version of the fifth amended complaint on the case docket on october  on december and   the court heard oral argument on the defendants motions for summary judgment 
those motions remain pending 
apollo does not believe that a loss from liability in this case is either probable or reasonably estimable 
apollo believes the plaintiffs claims lack factual and legal merit and intends to defend itself vigorously 
for these reasons  no estimate of possible loss  if any  can be made at this time 
in march  plaintiffs filed two putative class actions  captioned kelm v 
chase bank no 
cv and miller v 
flowers 
com  inc no 
cv  in the district of connecticut on behalf of a class of consumers alleging online fraud 
the defendants included  among others  trilegiant corporation  inc trilegiant  its parent company  affinion group  llc affinion  and apollo global management  llc  which is affiliated with funds that are the beneficial owners of of affinion s common stock 
in both cases  plaintiffs allege that trilegiant  aided by its business partners  who include e merchants and credit card companies  developed a set of business practices intended to create consumer confusion and ultimately defraud consumers into unknowingly paying fees to clubs for unwanted services 
plaintiffs allege that apollo is a proper defendant because of its indirect stock ownership and ability to appoint the majority of affinion s board 
the complaints assert claims under the racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act  the electronic communications privacy act  the connecticut unfair trade practices act  and the california business and professional code  and seek  among other things  restitution or disgorgement  injunctive relief  compensatory  treble and punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
the allegations in kelm and miller are substantially similar to those in schnabel v 
trilegiant corp 
no 
cv  a putative class action filed in the district of connecticut in that names only trilegiant and affinion as defendants 
the court has consolidated the kelm  miller  and schnabel cases under the caption in re trilegiant corporation  inc and ordered that they proceed on the same schedule 
on june   the court appointed lead plaintiffs counsel  and on september   plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint cac  which alleges the same causes of action against apollo as did the complaints in the kelm and miller cases 
defendants filed motions to dismiss on december   and plaintiffs filed opposition papers on february  defendants replies are due on march  on december   plaintiffs filed another putative class action  captioned frank v 
trilegiant corp 
no 
cv  in the district of connecticut  naming the same defendants and containing allegations substantially similar to those in the cac 
on january   plaintiffs moved to transfer and consolidate frank into in re trilegiant  and on february   the frank court extended all defendants deadlines to respond to the frank complaint until the earlier of i april  or ii a ruling on the motion to transfer and consolidate 
apollo believes that plaintiffs claims against it in these cases are without merit 
for this reason  and because the claims against apollo are in their early stages  no reasonable estimate of possible loss  if any  can be made at this time 

table of contents on july   apollo was served with a subpoena by the new york attorney general s office regarding apollo s fee waiver program 
the subpoena is part of what we understand to be an industry wide investigation by the new york attorney general into the tax implications of the fee waiver program implemented by numerous private equity and hedge funds 
under the fee waiver program  individual fund managers for apollo managed funds may elect to prospectively waive their management fees 
program participants receive an interest in the future profits  if any  earned on the invested amounts that represent waived fees 
they receive such profits from time to time in the ordinary course when distributions are made generally  as provided for in the applicable fund governing documents and waiver agreements 
four apollo funds have implemented the program 
apollo believes its fee waiver program complies with all applicable laws  and is cooperating with the investigation 
various state attorneys general and federal and state agencies have initiated industry wide investigations into the use of placement agents in connection with the solicitation of investments  particularly with respect to investments by public pension funds 
certain affiliates of apollo have received subpoenas and other requests for information from various government regulatory agencies and investors in apollo s funds  seeking information regarding the use of placement agents 
calpers  one of our strategic investors  announced on october   that it had initiated a special review of placement agents and related issues 
the report of the calpers special review was issued on march  that report does not allege any wrongdoing on the part of apollo or its affiliates 
apollo is continuing to cooperate with all such investigations and other reviews 
in addition  on may   the california attorney general filed a civil complaint against alfred villalobos and his company  arvco capital research  llc arvco a placement agent that apollo has used and federico buenrostro jr  the former chief executive officer of calpers  alleging conduct in violation of certain california laws in connection with calpers s purchase of securities in various funds managed by apollo and another asset manager 
apollo is not a party to the civil lawsuit and the lawsuit does not allege any misconduct on the part of apollo 
on december   the united states bankruptcy court for the district of nevada approved an application made by mr 
villalobos  arvco and related entities the arvco debtors in their consolidated bankruptcy proceedings to hire special litigation counsel to pursue certain claims on behalf of the bankruptcy estates of the arvco debtors  including potential claims against apollo a for fees that apollo purportedly owes the arvco debtors for placement agent services  and b for indemnification of legal fees and expenses arising out of the arvco debtors defense of the california attorney general action described above 
to date  no such claims have been brought 
on april   the sec filed a lawsuit alleging securities fraud on the part of arvco  as well as messrs 
buenrostro and villalobos  in connection with their activities concerning certain calpers investments in funds managed by apollo 
this lawsuit also does not allege wrongdoing on the part of apollo  and in fact alleges that apollo was defrauded by arvco  villalobos  and buenrostro 
apollo believes that it has handled its use of placement agents in an appropriate manner 
apollo denies the merit of all such claims and will vigorously contest them  if they are brought 
although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained at this time  we are of the opinion  after consultation with counsel  that the resolution of any such matters to which we are a party at this time will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
legal actions material to us could  however  arise in the future 
item mine safety disclosures not applicable 
iran related activities section of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of the itra added a new subsection r to section of the exchange act  requiring a public reporting issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or any of its affiliates have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to iran  including activities not prohibited by us law and conducted outside the us by us affiliates in compliance with local law

first  we will cause one or more entities in the apollo operating group to make a distribution to all of its partners  including our wholly owned subsidiaries apo corp  apo asset co  llc and apo fc  llc as applicable  and holdings  on a pro rata basis  second  we will cause our intermediate holding companies  apo corp  apo asset co  llc and apo fc  llc as applicable  to distribute to us  from their net after tax proceeds  amounts equal to the aggregate distribution we have declared  and third  we will distribute the proceeds received by us to our class a shareholders on a pro rata basis 
payments that any of our intermediate holding companies make under the tax receivable agreement will reduce amounts that would otherwise be available for distribution by us on our class a shares 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the apollo operating group intends to make periodic distributions to its partners that is  holdings and our intermediate holding companies in amounts sufficient to cover hypothetical income tax obligations attributable to allocations of taxable income resulting from their ownership interest in the various limited partnerships making up the apollo operating group  subject to compliance with any financial covenants or other obligations 
tax distributions will be calculated assuming each shareholder was subject to the maximum corporate or individual  whichever is higher combined us federal  new york state and new york city tax rates  without regard to whether any shareholder was subject to income tax liability at those rates 
because tax distributions to partners are made without regard to their particular tax situation  tax distributions to all partners  including our intermediate holding companies  will be increased to reflect the disproportionate income allocation to our managing partners and contributing partners with respect to built in gain assets at the time of the private offering transactions 
tax distributions will be made only to the extent all distributions from the apollo operating group for such year are insufficient to cover such tax liabilities and all such distributions will be made to all partners on a pro rata basis based upon their respective interests in the applicable partnership 
there can be no assurance that we will pay cash distributions on the class a shares in an amount sufficient to cover any tax liability arising from the ownership of class a shares 
under delaware law we are prohibited from making a distribution to the extent that our liabilities  after such distribution  exceed the fair value of our assets 
our operating agreement does not contain any restrictions on our ability to make distributions  except that we may only distribute class a shares to holders of class a shares 
the amh credit agreement  however  restricts the ability of amh to make cash distributions to us by requiring mandatory collateralization and restricting payments under certain circumstances 
amh will generally be restricted from paying distributions  repurchasing stock and making distributions and similar types of payments if any default or event of default occurs  if it has failed to deposit the requisite cash collateralization or does not expect to be able to maintain the requisite cash collateralization or if  after giving effect to the incurrence of debt to finance such distribution  its debt to ebitda ratio would exceed specified levels 
instruments governing indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries incur in the future may contain further restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to pay distributions or make other cash distributions to equity holders 
in addition  the apollo operating group s cash flow from operations may be insufficient to enable it to make required minimum tax distributions to its partners  in which case the apollo operating group may have to borrow funds or sell assets  and thus our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  by paying cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses  we might risk slowing the pace of our growth  or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations  new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise 

table of contents our cash distribution policy has certain risks and limitations  particularly with respect to liquidity 
although we expect to pay distributions according to our cash distribution policy  we may not pay distributions according to our policy  or at all  if  among other things  we do not have the cash necessary to pay the intended distributions 
as of december   approximately million rsus granted to apollo employees net of forfeited awards were entitled to distribution equivalents  to be paid in the form of cash compensation
